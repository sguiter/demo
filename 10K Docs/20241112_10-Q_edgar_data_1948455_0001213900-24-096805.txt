Weighted average basic and diluted ordinary shares outstanding 

Net loss per basic and diluted share of common stock 

The Company computes earnings per share EPS in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted
EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net loss divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is similar
to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (for example, convertible securities, options

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited condensed financial statements and the related
notes appearing elsewhere in this report. See Cautionary Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results could differ materially
from those discussed below. 

Overview 

We are committed to delivering superior products
that challenge industry norms, with the goal of delivering an unmatched customer and adult consumer experience. In achieving this, risk
reduction is central to our mission, and we aim to improve the lives of our consumers through cutting-edge research and development. Our
technology platforms look to reduce youth access to vaping products, which in turn, will facilitate our ability to provide adult consumers
with the products they desire. 

We are engaged in the research and development,
design, commercialization, sales, marketing and distribution of branded and non-branded vaping hardware products in both the nicotine
and cannabis spaces. Vaping refers to the practice of inhaling and exhaling the vapor produced by an electronic vaping device. These products
are sold into the global nicotine and cannabis markets in the form of e-cigarettes or cartridges filled with oils by our customers, respectively. 

We sell our e-cigarette (or nicotine) products
globally, in markets where we are legally permitted to do so. To date, our nicotine products are marketed under the Aspire 
brand name and are sold primarily through our expansive distribution network. However, we are currently preparing to expand our international
presence via the launch of nicotine products under the Ispire platform. These products will be launched under licensing arrangements with
the owner(s) of selected partner brand(s). 

We currently sell our cannabis vaping hardware
in the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Germany. However, we are continuing to develop our sales network across Europe, South
America, and other regions in preparation for legalization in these markets. Our cannabis products are sold under the Ispire brand name,
primarily on an ODM basis to other cannabis vapor companies including multi and single-state operators, brand owners and co-packers. ODM
generally involves the design and customization of the core products to meet each brand s unique image and needs. Our hardware products
are sold by our customers under their own brand names. We do not touch the cannabis plant in the production and sale of
our hardware products and thus are not subject to the specific cannabis-related regulatory and taxation provisions of the industry (e.g.,
IRS Code Section 280E). 

Since our initial public offering in April 2023,
we have completed three fundraising rounds. The first was executed as part of our initial public offering, from which we raised approximately
 18.3 million after underwriting and other offering expenses. 

In June 2023, we raised net proceeds of approximately
 7.4 million, after placement agent and offering expenses, from the private placement of our Common Stock to three investors. 

In March 2024, we raised net proceeds of approximately
 10.6 million, after placement agent fees and offering expenses, through a public offering of our Common Stock priced at 6.00 per share.
We used the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the establishment and operation of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia,
the funding of our joint venture with Touch Point Worldwide Inc. d/b/a/ Berify and Chemular Inc. and for working capital and general corporate
purposes, including research and development. 

Regulatory Risks 

The sale of nicotine and cannabis products is
subject to regulations worldwide. Many countries prohibit the sale of any cannabis products, and many countries have regulations relating
to nicotine products, with a particular emphasis on underage sales. We work closely with our various global distribution partners to help
ensure our nicotine products comply with local regulations (e.g., packaging, ingredient disclosure, health warnings, etc.). Changes in
the regulatory environment can be enacted swiftly and may lead to our products becoming non-compliant in one or more international markets.
This regulatory scenario may severely disrupt our business in these markets while we resolve the deficiencies (if possible) with the current
product offering. 

19 

E-cigarette regulation 

Regulation regarding e-cigarettes varies across
countries, from limited regulation to a total ban. The legal status of e-cigarettes is currently pending in many countries. As e-cigarettes
have become more and more popular recently, many countries are considering imposing more stringent law and regulations to regulate this
market. Changes in existing law and regulations and the imposition of new laws or regulations in countries and regions that our major
customers are in may adversely affect our business. 

In many markets e-cigarettes and other nicotine
products are subject to an excise tax. The amount of excise tax on our products is a key determining factor in our pricing and the value
proposition to our adult consumer target market. The structure (i.e., ad valorem vs. specific) and tax burden can vary significantly from
market to market. According to a 2023 study by Dauchy E, Fuss C. Global Taxation of Electronic Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Delivery Systems ,
the tax burden on nicotine vape products in Norway is 81.2 while the tax burden on the same products in Paraguay is 2.9 . The tax burden
and resulting retail sales price is a key factor in determining how competitive our products are compared to illicit vaping products.
The greater the price gap between legal and illicit vaping products the greater the incentive for adult consumers to buy illicit products.
These illicit vaping products are not subject to the same quality standards as our products and undermine the efforts of legal operators
seeking to help adult consumers switch from combustible tobacco products to vaping alternatives. 

United States E-Cigarette Market 

In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act requires all Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ENDS product manufacturers that market products in
the United States to submit Premarket Tobacco Product Applications PMTAs to the FDA. For ENDS products that were on the
U.S. market on or before August 8, 2016, a PMTA was required to be submitted to the FDA before September 9, 2020. For ENDS products that
were not on the U.S. market prior to August 8, 2016, and for which a PMTA was not filed before September 9, 2020, a PMTA premarket authorization
issued by FDA is required before the subject product may enter the U.S. market. We have submitted a PMTA filing for one ENDS product,
and, under apparent FDA policies, the agency will not enforce the premarket review requirements for that product pending review of its
PMTA. However, even with submission of the PMTA application, the FDA may reject our application and may prevent our ENDS products from
being sold in U.S., which will adversely affect our business. 

As a result of ENDS regulation noted above, we
can sell only one tobacco vaping product line, the Nautilus Prime, in the U.S. Our tobacco vaping sales related to this line in the U.S.
were approximately 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Because the volume
of sales did not justify the marketing and regulatory costs, we have ceased marketing tobacco vaping products in the U.S. 

On September 6, 2024, we submitted a PMTA application
for a disposable ENDS product with 4 flavors. This is an important milestone for us, as it signals our re-entry into the US ENDS market.
It is our intention to amend or resubmit this application in the coming months, once we have finalized the age-gating technology solution
with our IKE Tech LLC joint venture. We have further plans to submit additional PMTA applications for pod-based ENDS systems, which will
include age-gating technology, in the future as well. 

Amendments to the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking PACT Act, which became law in 2021, extend the PACT Act to include e-cigarettes and all vaping products, and place significant
burdens on sellers of vaping products in the United States which may make it difficult to operate profitably in the United States. Because
of tighter government regulations, we have stopped marketing tobacco vaping products in the United States, as the volume of sales from
the one tobacco vaping product which we may sell in the United States does not justify the marketing and regulatory costs involved. 

In the United States, cannabis vaping products
are governed by state laws, which vary from state to state. Most states do not permit the adult recreational use of cannabis, and no states
permit the sale of recreational cannabis products to minors.. Further, States may be more willing to permit recreational cannabis use
in the future given the DEA s intention to reschedule cannabis as a Schedule III controlled substance allowing for medicinal use.
We cannot predict what action states will take or the nature and amount of taxes they may impose. However, to the extent the PACT Act
applies to cannabis products that aerosolize liquids, it may be more difficult to sell our products in states that permit the sale of
cannabis. 

20 

However, cannabis and its derivatives containing
more than 0.3 delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol on a dry weight basis remain Schedule I controlled substances under U.S. federal law, meaning
that federal law generally prohibits their manufacture and distribution. United States federal law also deems it unlawful to sell, offer
for sale, transport in interstate commerce, import, or export drug paraphernalia, which includes any equipment, product,
or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing,
processing, preparing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance the
possession of which federal law prohibits, including Schedule I marijuana. Limited exemptions exist, most notably when state
or local law authorizes these items manufacture, possession, or distribution. 

European Market 

The European Commission issued the Tobacco Products
Directive (the TPD ), which became effective on May 19, 2014, and became applicable in the European Union member states on
May 20, 2016. The TPD regulates e-cigarettes on the packaging, labelling and ingredients of the products on the European Union market,
the creation of smoke-free environments, tax measures and activities against illegal trade and anti-smoke campaigns. Member states of
the European Union are required to ensure that advertisements for any tobacco-related product are prohibited, and no promotion shall be
made as to those devices with an intention to promote e-cigarettes. For the e-cigarettes released after May 20, 2016, TPD requires e-cigarette
manufacturers to submit product sales applications to the regulatory market six months in advance and ensure their products can meet the
TPD requirements before they can be released. We have complied with TPD requirements for all our tobacco products sold in Europe. 

The sale of cannabis vaping products is illegal in the European Union,
save for Germany, and the United Kingdom. 

Accounts Receivable 

Our business relies on the collection of accounts
receivable from our customers in a timely manner to maintain liquidity and support our ongoing operations. The balance of the allowance
for credit losses was 7.4 million and 5.9 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Receivables are written off after exhaustive collection efforts occur and the receivable is deemed uncollectible. The increase is due
to write offs after collection efforts, and then general rise in receivables balance and estimate losses. 

Our failure or inability to collect accounts receivable
when due results from a number of factors, including (i) our customer s failure to pay as a result of adverse economic conditions
affecting the customer s cash flow; (ii) our failure to implement effective collection efforts; and (iii) disputes over contract
terms, product quality or delays in delivery. Although we may implement strategies to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance
that such measures will be entirely effective, and we may continue to incur write-offs of accounts receivable, which may impair our ability
to operate profitably. 

Key Factors that Affect Our Results of Operations 

We believe the following key factors may affect
our financial condition and results of operations: 

The effect of legislation and
regulations affecting tobacco and cannabis vaping products. 

If we elect to market tobacco
vaping products in the United States, our ability to obtain regulatory approval to market additional tobacco vaping products in the United
States and the significant cost of seeking such approval. 

Our ability to develop and
market tobacco and cannabis vaping products to meet the changing tastes of adult consumers. 

The effects of competition. 

The development of an international
market for cannabis vaping products, which is presently primarily limited to certain states in the United States. 

The effect of both the outbreak
any other pandemic or other disease outbreak results in restrictions imposed by governments which may impact our ability to purchase
or assemble products as well as the ability of end users to purchase our products.

Our revenue decreased by 3,526,334, or 8.2 ,
from 42,864,647 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 39,338,313 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease
in revenue is the combined effect of (i) decreases in product sales in the United States of 8.1 million from 17.8 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, to 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by (ii) increases in sales of vaping
products in Europe of 2.1 million from 19.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 22.0 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and (iii) increases in sales to other regions of 3.7 million from 0.06 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, mainly contributed by increase
in sales to South Africa of 2.9 million. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue mainly consists of cost of purchases
of vaping products, that the majority of the purchase are from Shenzhen Yi Jia though there has been decreased reliance on this factory
in 2024 vs 2023. Cost of revenue decreased by 4,355,864, or 12.1 , from 36,019,799 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to
 31,663,935 for the year ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of revenue is in line with decrease in sales.

from 6,844,848 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 7,674,378 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, while our
gross margin increased from 16.0 to 19.5 . The increase in gross margin was primarily due to changes in product mix with more higher
margin products being sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses increased 5,214,154 or 67.5 ,
from 7,723,093 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 12,937,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Our sales and marketing expenses mainly consist
of employees salaries and benefits, marketing expense, travel expenses and others. 

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 1,967,028,
or 191.9 , from 1,025,219 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,992,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in (i) our marketing activities, marketing campaign and
trade shows of 0.7 million, (ii) stock-based compensation expense related to selling personnels of 1.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and (iii) headcount and payroll expense for Aspire Science of 0.1 million. 

Our general and administrative expenses mainly
consist of employee s salaries and benefits, rental expense, professional fees, share based payment expenses and other administrative
expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 3,247,126, or 48.5 , from 6,697,874 for the three months ended September
30, 2023 to 9,945,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to (i) increase in stock-based compensation
expense of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compensation and incentive for management, employees and service
providers, (ii) increase in bad debt expense as an allowance for credit losses of 1.9 million from accounts resulted from management s
assessment on Company s account receivables balances. 

Other expense(income), net 

Other income, net includes interest income, interest
expense, exchange gain (loss), net and other income (expense). 

Interest income was 72,246 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 and 86 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other expense(income) mainly consists of interest
expense, loss on equity method investment, credits from company credit card and other miscellaneous expenses. Other expense(income) increased
by 61,603, or 142.6 , from net expense of 43,204 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to net income of 18,399 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. 

23 

Exchange loss(gain) changes by 113,924, or 3111.8 ,
from net exchange gain of 3,661 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to net exchange gain of 117,585 for three months ended
September 30, 2024. 

As a result of these factors, other expense(income),
net increased by 91,903, from other income, net of 32,703 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to other income, net of 124,606
for three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes decreased by 39,292, or 0.2 , from
 496,045 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 456,753 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We had a consolidated
net loss for both three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which was the combined effect of a profit by Aspire Science and
a loss by Aspire North America and Ispire Malaysia. The profit from Aspire Science resulted in a current tax expense. The increase in
valuation allowance reflects our view that the taxable income in the future will not be sufficient to utilize the carryforward loss. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the foregoing, net loss increased
by 4,253,429, from net loss of 1,341,587, or (0.02) per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to
a net loss of 5,595,016, or (0.10) per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.6 million, reflected our net loss of 5.6 million, adjusted primarily as follows:
an add-back of credit loss expenses of 3.1 million, an add-back of stock based compensation expense of 2.0 million, increase in accounts
payable of 9.5 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 5.7 million. 

Net cash flow used in operating activities for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 13.1 million, reflected our net loss of 1.3 million, adjusted primarily as follows: an
add-back of depreciation of right-of-use assets of 0.4 million, an add-back of stock-based compensation expenses of 1.0 million, an
add-back of credit loss expenses of 0.2 million, a decrease in inventories of 1.9 million, a decrease of prepaid expenses and other
current assets of 1.6 million, an increase in income tax payable of 0.5 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 14.7
million and a decrease in accounts payable of 2.5 million. 

24 

Net cash flow used in investing activities for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.9 million reflected primarily purchase of property, plant and equipment of 0.3 million
and acquisition of intangible assets of 0.6 million. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.8 million reflected primarily purchase of property, plant and equipment of 0.5 million
and acquisition of intangible assets of 0.3 million. 

Net cash flow used in financing activities for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.7 million reflected primarily repayments to related parties of 0.7 million. 

To date, we have financed our operations primarily
through cash flow from operations and working capital accounts payable from our major stockholders, who are our co-chief executive officer
and his wife, when necessary. We plan to support our future operations primarily from cash generated from our operations and cash on hand.
We believe that our current cash and future cash flows provided by operating activities, and the net proceeds from our initial public
offering of 18.3 million will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs in the next 12 months. If we experience an adverse operating
environment or incur unanticipated capital expenditure requirements, or if we decide to accelerate our growth, then additional financing
may be required. We cannot give any assurance that additional financing will not be required or, if required, would be available on favorable
terms if at all. Such financing may include the use of additional debt or the sale of additional equity securities. Any financing which
involves the sale of equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders
which may be substantial. 

The cash at bank held by our Hong Kong operating
subsidiary can be freely transferred within our corporate structure without restriction. If our Hong Kong operating subsidiary were to
incur additional debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict the ability of our operating subsidiaries
to transfer cash to our U.S. investors. 

Contractual Obligations 

As of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, we
had contract liabilities of 2,245,505 and 2,218,166, respectively. These liabilities are advance deposits received from customers after
an order has been placed. We expect all of the contract liabilities to be settled in less than one year. 

We have operating lease arrangements for office
and factory premises for Hong Kong, California and Malaysia, which are treated as right-of-use assets. These leases typically have terms
of two to five years. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not presented as right-of-use assets and are expensed over
the lease term. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term at commencement date. 

The balances for the right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities where we are the lessee are presented as follow:

Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this this
Form 10-Q, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments, or events that are reasonably likely to have a material
effect on our net revenues, income from continuing operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported
financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition. 

Seasonality 

Seasonality does not materially affect our business
or the results of our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements. 

As a company with less than 1.235 billion
in revenue for our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company pursuant to the JOBS Act. An emerging growth
company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies.
These provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in
the assessment of the emerging growth company s internal control over financial reporting. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging
growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until such date that a private company is
otherwise required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of such exemptions.

ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting
company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4: Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the
foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to (1) the lack of controls needed to enable us to record assets acquired from a controlling
stockholder in accordance with GAAP, (2) the lack of controls needed to enable us to evaluate significant estimates, including (i) the
sufficiency of inventory reserve for slow-moving inventories and (ii) the credit loss history and use it to evaluate the sufficiency of
credit loss reserve for accounts receivable under the Topic 326, (3) the lack of comprehensive accounting policies and procedures manual
in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting, including IT general controls, and a financial risk assessment to evaluate controls,
and (4) the lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with appropriate technical expertise to evaluate complex accounting matters. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we have continued to develop and implement internal controls over financial reporting particularly in view of the
material weakness described above. 

Inherent Limitations of Controls 

Management does not expect
that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all
fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
