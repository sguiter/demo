billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which billion and billion, respectively, were held at First American Trust, FSB FA Trust ). The remaining deposits were held at third-party financial institutions. Escrow deposits held at third-party financial institutions are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. All such amounts are placed in deposit accounts insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company could be held contingently liable for the disposition of these assets. Trust assets administered by FA Trust totaled billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, were held at FA Trust. The remaining trust assets were held at third-party financial institutions. Trust assets administered by FA Trust and held at third-party institutions are fiduciary client assets. As such, these trust assets are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company could be held contingently liable if FA Trust were to breach any of its fiduciary duties. In conducting its operations, the Company often holds customers assets in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions and, as a result, the Company has ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits with various financial institutions. The results from these programs are included as either income or as a reduction in expense, as appropriate, in the condensed consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the arrangement and benefit received. The Company facilitates tax-deferred property exchanges for customers pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and tax-deferred reverse exchanges pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2000-37. As a facilitator and intermediary, the Company holds the proceeds from sales transactions and takes temporary title to property identified by the customer to be acquired with such proceeds. Upon the completion of each such exchange, the identified property is transferred to the customer or, if the exchange does not take place, an amount equal to the sales proceeds or, in the case of a reverse exchange, title to the property held by the Company is transferred to the customer. Like-kind exchange funds administered by the Company totaled billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The like-kind exchange deposits are held at third-party financial institutions and, due to the structure utilized to facilitate these transactions, the proceeds and property are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. All such amounts are placed in deposit accounts insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company could be held contingently liable to the customer for the transfers of property, disbursements of proceeds and the returns on such proceeds. In conducting its residential mortgage loan subservicing operations, the Company administers cash deposits on behalf of its clients. Cash deposits totaled billion and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, were held at FA Trust. The remaining deposits were held at third-party financial institutions. Cash deposits held at third-party financial institutions are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. All such amounts are placed in deposit accounts insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company could be held contingently liable for the disposition of these assets. In connection with certain accounts, the Company has ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits with various financial institutions whereby it earns economic benefits either as income or as a reduction in expense.

Based on the Company s review of its debt securities in an unrealized loss position it determined that the losses were due to non-credit factors and, therefore, it does not consider these securities to be credit impaired at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell any debt securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. In determining credit losses on its debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company considers certain factors that may include, among others, severity of the unrealized loss, security type, industry sector, credit rating, yield to maturity, profitability and stock performance. In the normal course of operations, the Company may seek to optimize its investment portfolio and prospective investment returns by selling certain debt securities in an unrealized loss (or gain) position for which such unrealized loss or gain has been deferred in other comprehensive income. Sales of such debt securities could result in the realization of material gains or losses recorded in net income in the period the debt securities are sold.

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate as a result of state and foreign income taxes for which the Company is liable, as well as permanent differences between amounts reported for financial statement purposes and amounts reported for income tax purposes, including the recognition of excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies associated with share-based payment transactions through income tax expense. The effective income tax rates also reflect the impact on pretax earnings from losses and impairments on investments. In addition, the effective income tax rates for 2024 reflect tax credits claimed in current and prior years. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and makes adjustments to the allowance as necessary. The factors used in assessing the likelihood of realization include forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented. The Company s ability to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of its deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company carried a valuation allowance of million. Based on future operating results in certain jurisdictions, it is possible that the current valuation allowance positions of those jurisdictions could be adjusted during the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liabilities for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions were million and million, respectively. The net increase in the liability during 2024 was primarily attributable to positions taken on the Company s tax returns for current and prior years. The liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 could be reduced by million and million, respectively, due to offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential adjustments, including timing adjustments and state income taxes. The net liability, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective income tax rate. The Company s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties, net of tax benefits, related to uncertain tax positions were not material as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The primary non-federal jurisdictions are California, Canada, India and the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is, generally, no longer subject to income tax examinations for U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to 2021, 2019 and 2014, respectively.

THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE DATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE. This Management s Discussion and Analysis contains the financial measure adjusted debt to capitalization ratio that is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), as it excludes the effects of secured financings payable and accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company is presenting this non-GAAP financial measure because it provides the Company s management and readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with additional insight into the financial leverage of the Company. The Company does not intend for this non-GAAP financial measure to be a substitute for any GAAP financial information. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, this non-GAAP financial measure has been presented with, and reconciled to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should use this non-GAAP financial measure only in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measure. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of adjusted debt to capitalization ratio may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

 A substantial portion of the revenues for the Company s title insurance and services segment result from sales of, and refinancings of loans on, residential and commercial real estate. In the home warranty segment, revenues associated with the initial year of coverage are impacted by volatility in residential purchase transactions. Traditionally, the greatest volume of real estate activity, particularly residential purchase activity, has occurred in the spring and summer months. However, changes in interest rates, as well as other changes in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, can cause fluctuations in the traditional pattern of real estate activity. The Company s total revenues decreased 75.1 million, or 5.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to net investment losses of 311.5 million in the current quarter compared to 163.6 million in net investment losses recognized in the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by increases in direct premiums and escrow fees in the title insurance business of 42.5 million, or 8.6 , and agent premiums of 19.4 million, or 2.9 . In the title insurance and services segment, direct premiums and escrow fees from domestic commercial purchase and residential refinance transactions increased 30.2 million, or 18.9 , 6.4 million, or 2.6 , and 4.3 million, or 20.0 , respectively. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association s September 23, 2024 Mortgage Finance Forecast (the MBA Forecast ), residential mortgage originations in the United States (based on the total dollar value of the transactions) are forecasted to increase 21.3 in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. According to the MBA Forecast, the dollar amount of purchase originations are forecasted to increase 5.3 and refinance originations are forecasted to increase 117.9 . This volume of domestic residential mortgage origination activity contributed to an increase of 2.6 in direct premiums and escrow fees for the Company s direct title operations from domestic residential purchase transactions and an increase of 20.0 from domestic refinance transactions in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the level of domestic title orders opened per day by the Company s direct title operations increased 3.9 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. Refinance opened orders per day increased 41.3 , while residential purchase and commercial opened orders per day decreased 2.3 and 0.3 , respectively, when compared with the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company initiated a strategic investment portfolio rebalancing project. In connection with its rebalancing project, the Company sold certain debt securities in an unrealized loss position, which resulted in realized losses of 345.4 million and proceeds of 2.8 billion.

 Direct premiums and escrow fees were 536.2 million and 1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 42.5 million, or 8.6 , and 56.3 million, or 4.0 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increases were due to increases in domestic average revenues per order. Domestic average revenues per order closed were 3,926 and 3,767 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 7.5 and 5.2 when compared with 3,653 and 3,581 for the respective periods of the prior year, which were due to increases in average revenues per order on commercial and purchase transactions. The Company s direct title operations closed 121,600 and 349,000 domestic title orders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 1.3 and a decrease of 1.7 when compared with 120,000 and 354,900 domestic title orders closed during the respective periods of the prior year, which were generally consistent with the changes in residential mortgage origination activity in the United States as reported in the MBA Forecast. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, domestic residential refinance orders closed per day increased by 12.3 and 1.6 , respectively, and domestic residential purchase orders closed per day decreased by 1.8 and 0.3 , respectively, when compared to the respective periods of the prior year. Agent premiums were 683.9 million and 1.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 19.4 million, or 2.9 , and a decrease of 15.6 million, or 0.8 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. Agent premiums are recorded when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by the Company. As a result, there is generally a delay between the agent s issuance of a title policy and the Company s recognition of agent premiums. Therefore, current quarter agent premiums typically reflect prior quarter mortgage origination activity. The increase in agent premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is generally consistent with the 3.1 increase in the Company s direct premiums and escrow fees in the second quarter of 2024 as compared with the second quarter of 2023. Information and other revenues primarily consist of revenues generated from fees associated with title search and related reports, title and other real property records and images, other non-insured settlement services and risk mitigation products and services. These revenues generally trend with direct premiums and escrow fees but are typically less volatile since a portion of the revenues are subscription based and do not fluctuate with transaction volumes. 

 31 

Information and other revenues were 241.7 million and 699.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 1.6 million, or 0.7 , and a decrease of 6.2 million, or 0.9 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to an increase in demand for the Company s information products. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the increased capture rate of title premiums from an affiliated title agent, which caused decreases in information and other revenues and comparable increases in direct premiums and escrow fees. Net investment income totaled 136.5 million and 378.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, decreases of 5.2 million, or 3.7 , and 29.3 million, or 7.2 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The decreases in investment income were primarily driven by declines in the Company s escrow and tax-deferred property exchange balances, partially offset by an increase in interest income from the Company s warehouse lending business. Net investment losses of 308.0 million and 283.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were primarily attributable to losses realized from the Company s investment portfolio rebalancing project discussed above, partially offset by a change in the fair values of marketable equity securities. Net investment losses of 15.6 million and 6.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were primarily attributable to changes in the fair values of marketable equity securities and losses recognized on sales of debt securities. Net investment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were also due to losses recognized on the sale of a title plant. Personnel costs were 491.7 million and 1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 23.2 million, or 5.0 , and 17.5 million, or 1.2 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increases for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily attributable to higher salary, incentive compensation, employee benefits, and payroll tax expense, partially offset by lower severance expense. Agents retained 546.7 million and 1.5 billion of title premiums generated by agency operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which compares with 531.4 million and 1.5 billion for the respective periods of the prior year. The percentages of title premiums retained by agents were 79.9 and 79.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 80.0 and 79.6 for the respective periods of the prior year. Other operating expenses were 251.8 million and 729.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 8.6 million, or 3.5 , and 18.7 million, or 2.6 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increases were primarily due to higher production and software expense. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also due to higher legal expense and the impact of an out-of-period adjustment of 6.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024 to write-off certain uncollectible balances related to fees that should have been previously written off, partially offset by lower professional services expense. The provision for policy losses and other claims, expressed as a percentage of title insurance premiums and escrow fees, was 3.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 3.0 and 3.33 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The 3.0 loss provision rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects an ultimate loss rate of 3.75 for the 2024 policy year and reserve releases of 0.75 , or 9.1 million and 25.0 million, respectively, for prior policy years, all based on title insurance premiums and escrow fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The 3.0 and 3.33 loss provision rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, reflected an ultimate loss rate of 3.75 for the 2023 policy year and reserve releases of 0.75 , or 8.6 million and 0.42 , or 14.0 million, respectively, for prior policy years, all based on title insurance premiums and escrow fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense was 51.9 million and 151.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 5.7 million, or 12.3 , and 16.4 million, or 12.1 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increases were primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software from recently deployed digital settlement products. Premium taxes were 17.8 million and 45.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 1.4 million, or 8.5 , and 0.8 million, or 1.8 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. Premium taxes as a percentage of title insurance premiums and escrow fees were 1.5 and 1.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.4 and 1.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

 32 

Interest expense was 24.1 million and 69.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 0.5 million, or 2.1 , and 8.9 million, or 14.6 , respectively, when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to higher interest expense in the Company s warehouse lending business. Pretax margins for the title insurance business reflect the high cost of performing the essential services required before insuring title, whereas the corresponding revenues are subject to regulatory and competitive pricing restraints. Due to the relatively high proportion of fixed costs in the title insurance business, pretax margins generally improve as closed order volumes increase. Pretax margins for the segment are also impacted by (1) net investment income and net investment gains or losses, which may not move in the same direction as closed order volumes, (2) the composition (residential or commercial) and type (resale, refinancing or new construction) of real estate activity and (3) the percentage of title insurance premiums generated by agency operations as margins from direct operations are generally higher than from agency operations due primarily to the large portion of the premium that is retained by the agent. The title insurance and services segment recorded a pretax margin loss of (10.1) and a pretax margin of 2.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with pretax margins of 10.5 and 9.9 in the respective periods of the prior year.

 Direct premiums were 103.5 million and 300.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 1.7 million, or 1.7 , and 3.9 million, or 1.3 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to an increase in the average price per policy. Personnel costs and other operating expenses totaled 43.6 million and 127.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 3.1 million, or 7.7 , and 6.2 million, or 5.1 , when compared with the respective periods of the prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to higher advertising, postage and salary expense. The provision for home warranty claims, expressed as a percentage of home warranty premiums, was 53.8 and 47.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 54.9 and 50.6 for the respective periods of the prior year. The decrease in the claims rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to lower claims frequency, partially offset by higher severity. The decrease in the claims rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to lower severity, partially offset by higher frequency. 

 33 

A large part of the revenues for the home warranty segment are generated by renewals and are not dependent on the level of real estate activity in the year of renewal. With the exception of the provision for losses, the majority of the expenses for this segment are variable in nature and, therefore, generally fluctuate with revenue. Accordingly, pretax margins (before provision for losses) are relatively constant, although, as a result of some fixed expenses, profit margins (before provision for losses) should nominally improve as premium revenues increase. Pretax margins are also impacted by net investment income and net investment gains or losses, which may not move in the same direction as premium revenues. The home warranty segment recorded pretax margins of 8.1 and 14.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 8.7 and 12.4 in the respective periods of the prior year.

 Net investment income totaled 9.2 million and 23.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with losses of 3.8 million and income of 11.7 million in the respective periods of the prior year. The changes in net investment income/losses were primarily attributable to fluctuations in earnings on investments associated with the Company s deferred compensation plan. Net investment losses of 4.0 million and 34.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily related to unrealized losses and impairment charges on non-marketable equity investments within the Company's venture investment portfolio and, also, included changes in the fair value of the Company's investment in Offerpad. Net investment losses of 147.3 million and 158.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were primarily related to unrealized losses and impairment charges on non-marketable equity investments within the Company's venture investment portfolio and, also, included changes in the fair value of the Company's investment in Offerpad. Personnel costs and other operating expenses totaled 16.3 million and 53.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 7.4 million and 48.5 million for the respective periods of the prior year. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to higher returns on participant investments within the Company s deferred compensation plan, partially offset by a reinsurance credit related to the wind down of the property and casualty insurance business. Interest expense totaled 12.5 million and 37.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 12.5 million and 39.0 for the respective periods of the prior year. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the repayment of the Company's 250 million 4.30 senior unsecured notes, upon maturity, in February 2023. 

 34 

Eliminations The Company s inter-segment eliminations were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. INCOME TAXES The Company s effective income tax rates (income tax benefit/expense as a percentage of loss/income before income taxes) were 28.4 and 8.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 29.4 and 23.2 for the respective periods of the prior year. The differences in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the impact on pretax earnings from losses and impairments on investments and the impact on state income taxes resulting from the relative proportion of income derived from the Company s insurance and non-insurance businesses. In addition, the effective income tax rates for 2024 reflect tax credits claimed in current and prior years. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and makes adjustments to the allowance as necessary. The factors used in assessing the likelihood of realization include forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented. The Company s ability to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of its deferred tax assets. Based on future operating results in certain jurisdictions, it is possible that the current valuation allowance positions of those jurisdictions could be adjusted during the next 12 months. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY Net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (103.4) million and 59.7 million, respectively, compared with (1.2) million and 181.2 million for the respective periods of the prior year. Net (loss) income attributable to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (104.0) million, or (1.00) per diluted share, and 58.7 million, or 0.56 per diluted share, respectively, compared with (1.7) million, or (0.02) per diluted share, and 182.7 million, or 1.75 per diluted share, for the respective periods of the prior year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash requirements. The Company generates cash primarily from sales of its products and services and from investment income. The Company s current cash requirements include operating expenses, taxes, payments of principal and interest on its debt, capital expenditures, dividends on its common stock, and may include business acquisitions, investments in private companies (primarily those in the venture-stage) and repurchases of its common stock. Management forecasts the cash needs of the holding company and its primary subsidiaries and regularly reviews their short-term and long-term projected sources and uses of funds, as well as the asset, liability, investment and cash flow assumptions underlying such forecasts. Based on the Company s ability to generate cash flows from operations, its liquid-asset position and amounts available on its revolving credit facility, management believes that its resources are sufficient to satisfy its anticipated operational cash requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months. The substantial majority of the Company s business is dependent upon activity in the real estate and mortgage markets, which are cyclical and seasonal. Periods of increasing interest rates and reduced affordability, supply and mortgage financing availability generally have an adverse effect on residential real estate activity and, therefore, typically decrease the Company s revenues. In contrast, periods of declining interest rates and increased affordability, supply and mortgage financing availability generally have a positive effect on residential real estate activity, which typically increases the Company s revenues. Residential purchase activity is typically slower in the winter months with increased volumes in the spring and summer months. Residential refinance activity is typically more volatile than purchase activity and is highly impacted by changes in interest rates. Commercial real estate volumes are less sensitive to changes in interest rates but fluctuate based on local supply and demand conditions for space and financing availability. 

 35 

Cash provided by operating activities totaled 572.9 million and 396.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, after claim payments, net of recoveries, of 295.9 million and 289.1 million, respectively. The principal nonoperating uses of cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were advances and repayments related to secured financing transactions, purchases of debt and equity securities, dividends to common stockholders, capital expenditures and repurchases of Company shares. Principal nonoperating uses of cash and cash equivalents also included decreases in deposits at the Company's banking operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and repayment of senior unsecured notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The principal nonoperating sources of cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were borrowings and collections related to secured financing transactions, and proceeds from the sales and maturities of debt and equity securities. Principal nonoperating sources of cash and cash equivalents also included net proceeds from issuance of unsecured senior notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and increases in the deposit balances at the Company s banking operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net effect of all activities on cash and cash equivalents was a decrease of 651.9 million and an increase of 355.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases in the Company s cash and deposit liability balances at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023, reflect the Company s return to a normal allocation process for managing escrow deposits at its federal savings bank subsidiary in 2024. Due to the cybersecurity incident in late December 2023, the Company maintained a higher proportion of escrow deposits at its federal savings bank at December 31, 2023. The Company continually assesses its capital allocation strategy, including decisions relating to dividends, stock repurchases, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments. In September 2024, the quarterly cash dividend was increased to 54 cents per common share, representing a 2 increase. The dividend increase was effective beginning with the September 2024 dividend. Management expects that the Company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at or above the current level. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends, however, falls within the discretion of the Company s board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company s financial condition and earnings, the capital requirements of the Company s businesses, restrictions imposed by applicable law and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant from time to time. The Company maintains a stock repurchase plan with authorization up to 400.0 million, of which 153.5 million remained as of September 30, 2024. Purchases may be made from time to time by the Company in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 1.1 million shares of its common stock for a total purchase price of 60.3 million and, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased and retired 4.6 million shares of its common stock under the current authorization for a total purchase price of 246.5 million. Holding Company. First American Financial Corporation is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. The holding company s current cash requirements include payments of principal and interest on its debt, taxes, payments in connection with employee benefit plans, dividends on its common stock and other expenses. The holding company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. The Company s target is to maintain a cash balance at the holding company equal to at least twelve months of estimated cash requirements. At certain points in time, the actual cash balance at the holding company may vary from this target due to, among other factors, the timing and amount of cash payments made and dividend payments received. Pursuant to insurance and other regulations under which the Company s insurance subsidiaries operate, the amount of dividends, loans and advances available to the holding company is limited, principally for the protection of policyholders. As of September 30, 2024, under such regulations, the maximum amount available to the holding company from its insurance subsidiaries for the remainder of 2024, without prior approval from applicable regulators, was dividends of 525.1 million and loans and advances of 108.3 million. However, the timing and amount of dividends paid by the Company s insurance subsidiaries to the holding company falls within the discretion of each insurance subsidiary s board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the level of total statutory capital and surplus required to support minimum financial strength ratings by certain rating agencies. Such restrictions have not had, nor are they expected to have, an impact on the holding company s ability to meet its cash obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the holding company s sources of liquidity included 568.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 900.0 million available on the Company s revolving credit facility. Management believes that liquidity at the holding company is sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months. Financing. In September 2024, the Company issued 450.0 million of 5.45 senior unsecured notes due in 2034. Interest is due semi-annually on March 30 and September 30, beginning March 30, 2025. 

 36 

The Company expects to repay its 300.0 million 4.60 senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2024, upon maturity, through proceeds from its bond offering in September 2024. The Company maintains a senior unsecured credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto that provides for a 900.0 million revolving credit facility. The credit agreement includes an expansion option that permits the Company, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to increase the revolving commitments and/or add term loan tranches in an aggregate amount not to exceed 450.0 million. The obligations of the Company under the credit agreement are neither secured nor guaranteed. Proceeds from borrowings made from time to time under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Unless terminated earlier, the credit agreement will terminate on May 17, 2028. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the facility. In addition to amounts available under its credit facility, certain subsidiaries of the Company maintain separate financing arrangements. The primary financing arrangements maintained by subsidiaries of the Company are as follows: FirstFunding, Inc., a specialized warehouse lender to correspondent mortgage lenders, maintains secured warehouse lending facilities with several banking institutions. At September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under these facilities totaled 878.2 million. 

 First American Trust, FSB FA Trust ), a federal savings bank, maintains a secured line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank and maintains access to the Federal Reserve's Discount Window. At September 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. 

 First Canadian Title Company Limited, a Canadian title insurance and services company, maintains credit facilities with certain Canadian banking institutions. At September 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under these facilities. 

 The Company s debt to capitalization ratios were 34.8 and 28.6 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s adjusted debt to capitalization ratio, excluding secured financings payable of 878.2 million and 553.3 million and accumulated other comprehensive loss of 290.5 million and 655.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was 25.5 and 20.2 , respectively. Investment Portfolio. The Company maintains a high quality, liquid investment portfolio that is primarily held at its insurance and banking subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, 95 of the Company s investment portfolio consisted of debt securities, of which 72 were either United States government-backed or rated AAA and 97 were either rated or classified as investment grade. Percentages are based on the estimated fair values of the securities. Credit ratings reflect published ratings obtained from globally recognized securities rating agencies. If a security was rated differently among the rating agencies, the lowest rating was selected. For further information on the credit quality of the Company s debt securities portfolio at September 30, 2024, see Note 3 Debt Securities to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition to its debt and marketable equity securities portfolio, the Company maintains investments in non-marketable equity securities and securities accounted for under the equity method. For further information on the Company s equity securities, see Note 4 Equity Securities to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Off-balance sheet arrangements. The Company administers escrow deposits as a service to customers in its direct title operations. Escrow deposits totaled 9.0 billion and 10.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 4.6 billion and 6.3 billion, respectively, were held at FA Trust. The remaining deposits were held at third-party financial institutions. Escrow deposits held at third-party financial institutions are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. All such amounts are placed in deposit accounts insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company could be held contingently liable for the disposition of these assets. Trust assets administered by FA Trust totaled 4.8 billion and 4.4 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 155.2 million and 197.1 million, respectively, were held at FA Trust. The remaining trust assets were held at third-party financial institutions. Trust assets administered by FA Trust and held at third-party institutions are fiduciary client assets. As such, these trust assets are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company could be held contingently liable if FA Trust were to breach any of its fiduciary duties. In conducting its operations, the Company often holds customers assets in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions and, as a result, the Company has ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits with various financial 

 37 

institutions. The results from these programs are included as either income or as a reduction in expense, as appropriate, in the condensed consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the arrangement and benefit received. The Company facilitates tax-deferred property exchanges for customers pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and tax-deferred reverse exchanges pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2000-37. As a facilitator and intermediary, the Company holds the proceeds from sales transactions and takes temporary title to property identified by the customer to be acquired with such proceeds. Upon the completion of each such exchange, the identified property is transferred to the customer or, if the exchange does not take place, an amount equal to the sales proceeds or, in the case of a reverse exchange, title to the property held by the Company is transferred to the customer. Like-kind exchange funds administered by the Company totaled 2.0 billion and 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The like-kind exchange deposits are held at third-party financial institutions and, due to the structure utilized to facilitate these transactions, the proceeds and property are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. All such amounts are placed in deposit accounts insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company could be held contingently liable to the customer for the transfers of property, disbursements of proceeds and the returns on such proceeds. In conducting its residential mortgage loan subservicing operations, the Company administers cash deposits on behalf of its clients. Cash deposits totaled 1.2 billion and 830.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 882.7 million and 485.7 million, respectively, were held at FA Trust. The remaining deposits were held at third-party financial institutions. Cash deposits held at third-party financial institutions are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. All such amounts are placed in deposit accounts insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company could be held contingently liable for the disposition of these assets. In connection with certain accounts, the Company has ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits with various financial institutions whereby it earns economic benefits either as income or as a reduction in expense. Deposit balances held at FA Trust are temporarily invested in cash and cash equivalents and debt securities, with offsetting liabilities included in deposits in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company s primary exposure to market risk relates to interest rate risk associated with certain financial instruments. Although the Company monitors its risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates, it does not currently use derivative financial instruments on any significant scale to hedge these risks. There have been no material changes in the Company s market risks since the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4.	Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(b) thereunder. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.	Legal Proceedings. See Note 17 Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited) of Part I of this report, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1 of Part II. Item 1A. 	 Risk Factors. The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, operations, reputation, financial position or future financial performance. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company faces risks other than those listed here, including those that are unknown to the Company and others of which the Company may be aware but, at present, considers immaterial. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting the Company s operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. STRATEGIC RISK FACTORS 1. The Company s risk management framework could prove inadequate, which could adversely affect the Company 

 The Company s risk management framework is designed to identify, monitor and mitigate risks that could have a negative impact on the Company s financial condition or reputation. This framework includes departments or groups dedicated to enterprise risk management, treasury management, information security, disaster recovery and other information technology-related risks, business continuity, legal and compliance, compensation structures and other human resources matters, vendor management and internal audit, among others. Many of the processes overseen by these departments function at the enterprise level, but many also function through, or rely to a certain degree upon, risk mitigation efforts in local operating groups. This is especially the case with respect to the Company s operations outside of the United States and recently acquired businesses, which may not be fully integrated into the Company s risk management framework. Similarly, with respect to the risks the Company assumes in the ordinary course of its business through the issuance of title insurance policies and the provision of related products and services, the Company employs localized, as well as centralized risk mitigation efforts. These efforts include the implementation of underwriting policies and procedures, automated underwriting and other risk-decisioning tools and other mechanisms for assessing and managing risk. Underwriting title insurance policies and making other risk-assumption decisions frequently involves a substantial degree of individual judgment and, accordingly, underwriters are maintained at the state, regional, divisional, and corporate levels with varying degrees of underwriting authority. These individuals may be encouraged by customers or others to assume risks or to expeditiously make risk determinations. If the Company s risk mitigation efforts prove inadequate, the Company could be adversely affected. 2. The Company is pursuing various innovative initiatives, which could result in increased title claims or otherwise adversely affect the Company 

 In an effort to speed the delivery of its products, increase efficiency, improve quality, improve the customer experience and decrease risk, the Company is utilizing innovative technologies, processes and techniques, including artificial intelligence, in the production and delivery of its products and services. These efforts include converting certain manual processes into automated ones to streamline searches, examinations and other underwriting functions in connection with the issuance of title insurance policies, building and maintaining title plants and other data assets, and digitizing and automating components of the settlement process. The Company believes these innovations will improve the customer experience by simplifying and reducing the time it takes to close a transaction, reducing risk and improving communication, and expects to continue expanding its use of these technologies. Risks from these and other innovative initiatives include those associated with potential defects in the design and development of the technologies used to automate processes; misapplication of technologies; the reliance on data, rules or assumptions that may prove inadequate; information security vulnerabilities; and failure to meet customer expectations, among others. As a result of these risks, the Company could experience increased claims, reputational damage or other adverse effects, which could be material to the Company. 

 39 

3. Potentially disruptive innovation in the real estate industry and/or the Company s participation in these efforts could adversely affect the Company 

 In addition to the Company s innovative activities, other participants in the real estate industry are seeking to innovate in ways that could adversely impact the Company s businesses. These participants include certain of the Company s sources of business, competitors, investments and ultimate customers. Innovations by these participants may change the demand for the Company s products and services, the manner in which the Company s products and services are ordered or fulfilled and the revenue or profitability derived from the Company s products and services. The Company s investments in some of these participants could also facilitate efforts that ultimately disrupt the Company s business or enable competitors. Accordingly, the Company s efforts to anticipate and participate in these transformations could require significant additional investment and management attention and may not succeed. These innovative efforts by third parties, and the manner in which the Company, its agents and other industry participants respond to them, could therefore have an adverse effect on the Company. OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS 4. Conditions in the real estate market generally impact the demand for a substantial portion of the Company s products and services 

 Demand for a substantial portion of the Company s products and services generally decreases as the number of real estate transactions in which its products and services are purchased decreases. The number of real estate transactions in which the Company s products and services are purchased typically decreases in the following situations, among others: when mortgage interest rates are high or rising; 

 when the availability of credit, including commercial and residential mortgage funding, is limited; 

 when real estate affordability is declining; 

 when real estate inventory levels are insufficient or declining; and 

 when economic conditions are unfavorable, including during periods of high unemployment. 

 Certain of these circumstances, particularly when combined with declining real estate values and the increase in foreclosures that often results therefrom, also tend to adversely impact the Company s title claims experience. National inventory levels for residential homes for sale remain below historical average levels, and, combined with sustained high mortgage interest rates and elevated home prices, which decreased demand, contributed to historically weak residential purchase activity. Residential refinance activity is also strongly correlated with changes in mortgage interest rates and rising mortgage rates, beginning in 2022, expectedly, had an adverse impact on the Company s refinance business that is expected to continue for so long as mortgage rates remain high relative to the interest rates of outstanding mortgages. Higher interest rates also negatively impacted commercial transactions beginning in the latter half of 2022 and will likely continue to impact our volumes. 5. Unfavorable economic conditions adversely affect the Company 

 Historically, uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, have created a difficult operating environment for the Company. These conditions also tend to negatively impact, and recently have impacted, the amount of funds the Company receives from third parties held in trust pending the closing of commercial and residential real estate transactions. The Company deposits a substantial portion of these funds, as well as its own funds, with the federal savings bank it owns. The Company s bank invests those funds and any realized and unrealized losses on those investments will be reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The likelihood of such losses, which generally would not occur if the Company were to deposit these funds in an unaffiliated entity, increases when economic conditions are unfavorable. Moreover, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, the return on these funds deposited at the Company s bank, as well as funds the Company deposits with third party financial institutions, tends to decline. In addition, the Company holds investments in entities, such as title agencies, settlement service providers and venture-stage companies, some of which have been negatively impacted by these conditions, as well as other securities in its investment portfolio, which also may be, and recently have been, negatively impacted by these conditions. 

 40 

Depending upon the ultimate severity and duration of any economic downturn and other negative economic conditions, the resulting effects on the Company could be materially adverse, including a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, higher claims, challenges to the Company s ability to satisfy covenants or otherwise meet its obligations under debt facilities and other contracts, difficulties in obtaining access to capital, challenges to the Company s ability to pay dividends at currently anticipated levels, deterioration in the value of or return on its investments and increased credit risk from customers and others with obligations to the Company. 6. The Company s use of models involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company 

 The Company utilizes models to support decisions related to risk management, capital and liquidity planning, financial accounting, data extraction and other business purposes. Models are, by their nature, inherently limited due to their reliance on statistical, economic, financial or mathematical theories, techniques, data and assumptions that may be erroneous or inappropriate for the intended or actual use. Flawed models or uses of models, particularly those that rely on artificial intelligence, may result in, among other consequences, erroneous, biased or misleading outputs, imprudent business decisions, inadequate risk management or enhanced regulatory supervision. Heightened regulatory supervision and an evolving regulatory landscape could hinder the pace of the Company s innovation and may require burdensome changes to the Company s existing governance, processes and controls. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and reputation. 7. Climate change, severe weather conditions, health crises, terrorist attacks and other catastrophe events could adversely affect the Company 

 Climate change, global or extensive health crises, severe weather, terrorist attacks and other catastrophe events and responses to these events could adversely affect the Company. The extent to which these catastrophe events and responses to them impact the Company s business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous factors that the Company may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the catastrophe event and restrictions and responses to it; the impact of the catastrophe event on economic activity and actions taken in response, including the efficacy of governmental and other relief efforts or countermeasures; the effect on participants in real estate transactions and the demand for the Company s products and services. The Company s home warranty business has been and may be impacted by increases in the frequency and severity of weather events. Home warranty claims, including those pertaining to HVAC systems, tend to rise as temperatures become extreme, especially in geographies where extreme temperatures are infrequent. In addition, the Company manages its financial exposure for losses in its title insurance business with third-party reinsurance. Catastrophe events could adversely affect the cost and availability of that reinsurance. Moreover, to the extent climate change, health crises, terrorist attacks, severe weather conditions and other catastrophe events impact companies or municipalities whose securities the Company invests in, the value of its investments may also decrease due to these factors. The frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of such health crises, catastrophe and severe weather events are inherently unpredictable, and, therefore, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate impact climate change, catastrophe events and responses to them will have on its businesses. The impacts of catastrophe events and responses to them may also exacerbate the risks discussed elsewhere in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. 8. The Company may find it difficult to acquire necessary data 

 Certain data used and supplied by the Company are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to such data has not had a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations to date. Nonetheless, federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States designed to protect the public from the misuse of personal information in the marketplace and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may affect the Company s operations and could result in substantial regulatory compliance expense, litigation expense and a loss of revenue. The suppliers of data to the Company face similar burdens. As a result of these and other factors, the Company may find it financially burdensome to acquire necessary data. 

 41 

9. Changes in the Company s relationships with large mortgage lenders or government sponsored enterprises could adversely affect the Company 

 Large mortgage lenders and government-sponsored enterprises, because of their significant role in the mortgage process, have significant influence over the Company and other service providers. Changes in the Company s relationship with any of these lenders or government-sponsored enterprises, the loss of all or a portion of the business the Company derives from these parties, any refusal of these parties to accept the Company s products and services, the modification of the government-sponsored enterprises requirements for title insurance or mortgage servicing in connection with mortgages they purchase or the use of alternatives to the Company s products and services, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 10. A downgrade by ratings agencies, reductions in statutory capital and surplus maintained by the Company s title insurance underwriters or a deterioration in other measures of financial strength could adversely affect the Company 

 Certain of the Company s customers use measurements of the financial strength of the Company s title insurance underwriters, including, among others, ratings provided by ratings agencies and levels of statutory capital and surplus maintained by those underwriters, in determining the amount of a policy they will accept and the amount of reinsurance required. Each of the major ratings agencies currently rates the Company s title insurance operations. These ratings provide the agencies perspectives on the financial strength, operating performance and cash generating ability of those operations. These agencies continually review these ratings and the ratings are subject to change. Statutory capital and surplus, or the amount by which statutory assets exceed statutory liabilities, is also a measure of financial strength. Accordingly, if the ratings or statutory capital and surplus of these title insurance underwriters are reduced from their current levels, or if there is a deterioration in other measures of financial strength, the Company s results of operations, competitive position and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, a downgrade in the ratings or rankings for the Company s federal savings bank subsidiary or its mortgage servicing business could have an adverse effect on that particular business. 11. The issuance of the Company s title insurance policies and related activities by independent title agents could adversely affect the Company 

 The Company s title insurance subsidiaries issue a significant portion of their policies through title agents that usually operate with substantial independence from the Company. There is no guarantee that these title agents will fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company, which contracts include limitations that are designed to limit the Company s risk with respect to their activities. In addition, regulators are increasingly seeking to hold the Company responsible for the actions of these title agents and, under certain circumstances, the Company may be held liable directly to third parties for actions (including defalcations) or omissions of these agents. Case law in certain states also suggests that the Company is liable for the actions or omissions of its agents in those states, regardless of contractual limitations. As a result, the Company s use of title agents could result in increased claims on the Company s policies issued through agents and an increase in other costs and expenses. 12. Systems damage, failures, interruptions, cyberattacks and intrusions, and unauthorized data disclosures by the Company or its service providers may disrupt the Company s business, harm the Company s reputation, result in material claims for damages or otherwise adversely affect the Company 

 The Company uses computer software applications, systems and other technologies (collectively referred to as systems ), some of which it owns and manages and some of which are owned and/or managed by third parties, including providers of distributed computing infrastructure platforms commonly known as the cloud. The Company and its agents, suppliers, service providers, and customers use systems to receive, process, store and transmit business information, including non-public personal information as well as data from suppliers and other information upon which the Company s business relies. The Company also uses these systems to manage substantial cash, investment assets, bank deposits, trust assets, escrow account balances and custodial balances on behalf of itself and its customers, among other activities. Many of the Company s products, services and solutions involving the use of real property related data are fully reliant on these systems and are only available electronically. Accordingly, for a variety of reasons, the integrity of these systems and the protection of the information that resides thereon are critically important to the Company s successful operation. These systems have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, malware, cyberattacks and cyberterrorism, ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, unauthorized access, online and offline fraud and other malicious activity. These attacks are prevalent, continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, and are increasingly difficult to detect. These systems also have known and unknown vulnerabilities. Once identified, the Company s information technology and information security personnel seek to remediate these vulnerabilities based on the level of risk presented. For a number of reasons, including the introduction of new vulnerabilities, resource constraints, competing business demands and dependence on third parties, a number of unremediated vulnerabilities will always exist. Remediation of some vulnerabilities are outside of 

 42 

the control of the Company and third-party remediation efforts may not be timely provided or implemented or otherwise adequate, even when the level of risk is critical or high. Further, certain other potential causes of system damage or other negative system-related events are wholly or partially beyond the Company s control, such as natural disasters, vendor failures to satisfy service level requirements, third party negligence or intentional acts, and power or telecommunications failures. These circumstances could expose the Company to system-related damages, failures, interruptions, cyberattacks, as the Company experienced in December 2023 (as described further in Item 1C. Cybersecurity of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023), and other negative events or could otherwise disrupt the Company s business and could also result in the loss or unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information pertaining to the Company, its customers, employees, agents or suppliers. In conducting its business and delivering its products and services, the Company also utilizes service providers. These service providers and the systems they utilize are typically subject to similar types of system- and information security-related risks that the Company faces. The Company provides certain of these service providers with data, including nonpublic personal information. There is no guarantee that the Company s due diligence or ongoing vendor oversight will be sufficient to ensure the integrity and security of the systems utilized by these service providers or the protection of the information that resides thereon. Certain laws and contracts the Company has entered into require it to comply with certain information security requirements and to notify various parties, including consumers or customers, in the event of certain actual or potential data breaches or systems failures, including those of the Company s service providers. Further, the Company s financial institution customers have obligations to safeguard their systems and sensitive information and the Company may be bound contractually and/or by regulation to comply with the same requirements. If the Company or its service providers fail to comply with applicable regulations and contractual requirements, the Company could be exposed to lawsuits, governmental proceedings or the imposition of fines, among other consequences. Any inability of the Company or its service providers to prevent or adequately respond to the issues described above could disrupt the Company s business, delay the delivery of its products and services, inhibit its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, divert management s time and energy, otherwise harm its reputation and/or result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory inquiries, increased costs or other adverse consequences that could be material to the Company. 13. Errors and fraud involving the transfer of funds may adversely affect the Company 

 The Company relies on its systems, employees and domestic and international banks to transfer its own funds and the funds of third parties. In addition to relying on third-party banks to transfer these funds, the Company s federal savings bank subsidiary transfers funds on behalf of the Company as well as title agents that are not affiliates of the Company. These transfers are susceptible to user input error, fraud, system interruptions, incorrect processing and similar errors that from time to time result in lost funds or delayed transactions. The Company s email and computer systems and systems used by its agents, customers and other parties involved in a transaction have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, fraudulent attacks, including attempts to cause the Company or its agents to improperly transfer funds. These attacks continue to increase in frequency and sophistication. Funds transferred to a fraudulent recipient may not be recoverable. In certain instances the Company may be liable for those unrecovered funds. The controls and procedures used by the Company to prevent transfer errors and fraud may prove inadequate, resulting in financial losses, reputational harm, loss of customers or other adverse consequences which could be material to the Company. 14. The Company s failure to recruit and retain qualified employees may adversely affect the business 

 The Company s continued success depends, in large part, on its ability to hire and retain qualified people. Competition for highly qualified people is significant, and there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting, training or retaining people. If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified people, its business and operations may be impaired or disrupted. 15. The Company s use of a global workforce involves risks that could adversely affect the Company 

 The Company utilizes lower cost labor in countries such as India and the Philippines, among others. These countries are subject to relatively high degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand natural disasters, health crises and other catastrophe events. Such disruptions could decrease efficiency and increase the Company s costs. Weakness of the United States dollar in relation to the currencies used in these countries may also reduce the savings achievable through this strategy. Laws, regulations, business requirements or social or political pressures may require the Company to 

 43 

use labor based in the United States or may otherwise effectively increase the Company s labor costs abroad. The Company may not be able to pass on these increased costs to its customers. 16. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business 

 The Company has in the past acquired, and is expected to acquire in the future, other businesses. When businesses are acquired, the Company may not be able to integrate or manage these businesses in such a manner as to realize the anticipated synergies or otherwise produce returns that justify the investment. Acquired businesses may subject the Company to increased regulatory or compliance requirements. The Company s acquisitions have involved, and are likely to continue to involve, the entry into businesses in which the Company s management has limited prior experience, making the Company reliant on the management team of the acquired business. The Company may not be able to successfully retain employees of acquired businesses or integrate them, and could lose customers, suppliers or other partners as a result of the acquisitions. For these and other reasons, including changes in market conditions, the projections used to value the acquired businesses may prove inaccurate. In addition, the Company might incur unanticipated liabilities from acquisitions. These and other factors related to acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Company s management also will continue to be required to dedicate substantial time and effort to the integration of its acquisitions. These efforts could divert management s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK FACTORS 17. Regulatory oversight and changes in government regulation could require the Company to raise capital, make it more difficult to deploy capital, including dividends to stockholders and repurchases of the Company s shares, prohibit or limit the Company s operations, make it more costly or burdensome to conduct such operations, result in decreased demand for the Company s products and services or otherwise adversely affect the Company 

 Many of the Company s businesses, including its title insurance, property and casualty insurance, home warranty, mortgage servicing and subservicing, banking, trust and wealth management businesses, are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These and other of the Company s businesses also operate within statutory guidelines, which can include requirements to maintain certain licenses at the federal, state and/or local levels. The industry in which the Company operates and the markets into which it sells its products are also regulated and subject to statutory guidelines. In general, in recent years, the Company experienced increasing regulatory oversight and became subject to increasingly complex statutory guidelines. Regulatory oversight could require the Company to raise capital, and/or make it more difficult to deploy capital, including dividends to stockholders and repurchases of the Company s shares. It is possible that the group capital calculations, particularly in an economic downturn, could have the effect of requiring the Company to raise capital and/or making it more difficult to otherwise deploy capital, including dividends to stockholders and repurchases of the Company s shares. An increasing number of federal, state, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. The effects of these privacy and data protection laws, including the cost of compliance and required changes in the manner in which the Company conducts its business, are not fully known and are potentially significant, and the failure to comply could adversely affect the Company. The Company has incurred costs to comply with these laws and to respond to inquiries about its compliance with them. In addition, changes in the applicable regulatory environment, such as the announcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB that it intends to consider a policy that would prohibit lenders from directly passing the cost of lenders title insurance to consumers; statutory guidelines or interpretations of existing regulations or statutes; reform of government-sponsored enterprises such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac); enhanced governmental oversight or efforts by governmental agencies to cause customers to refrain from using the Company s products or services could prohibit or limit its future operations or make it more costly or burdensome to conduct such operations or result in decreased demand for the Company s products and services or a change in its competitive position. The impact of these changes would be more significant if they involve jurisdictions in which the Company generates a greater portion of its title premiums, such as the states of Arizona, California, Florida, New York, and Texas. These changes may compel the Company to reduce its prices, may restrict its ability to implement price increases or acquire assets or businesses, may limit the manner in which the Company conducts its business or otherwise may have a negative impact on its ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. 

 44 

18. Scrutiny of the Company s businesses and the industries in which it operates by governmental entities and others could adversely affect the Company 

 The real estate settlement services industry, an industry in which the Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue and earnings, and the mortgage servicing and subservicing industry are subject to continuous scrutiny by regulators, legislators, the media and plaintiffs attorneys. Though often directed at these industries generally, these groups also focus their attention directly on the Company s businesses from time to time. In either case, this scrutiny may result in changes which could adversely affect the Company s operations and, therefore, its financial condition and liquidity. Governmental entities have routinely inquired into certain practices in the real estate settlement services industry and the mortgage servicing and subservicing industry to determine whether certain of the Company s businesses or its competitors have violated applicable laws, which include, among others, the insurance codes of the various jurisdictions, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act and similar state, federal and foreign laws. The CFPB, for example, has actively utilized its regulatory authority over the mortgage and real estate markets by bringing enforcement actions against various participants in the mortgage and settlement industries and we expect that such enforcement activity will intensify. Departments of insurance in the various states, the CFPB and other federal regulators and applicable regulators in international jurisdictions, either separately or together, also periodically conduct targeted inquiries into the practices of title insurance companies, other settlement services providers and mortgage servicers in their respective jurisdictions. Currently, the Company is the subject of regulatory inquiries. Further, from time to time plaintiffs lawyers have targeted, and are expected to continue to target, the Company and other members of the Company s industry with lawsuits claiming legal violations or other wrongful conduct. These lawsuits often involve large groups of plaintiffs and claims for substantial damages. These types of inquiries or proceedings have from time to time resulted, and may in the future result, in findings of a violation of the law or other wrongful conduct and the payment of fines or damages or the imposition of restrictions on the Company s conduct. This could impact the Company s operations and financial condition. Moreover, these laws and standards of conduct often are ambiguous and, thus, it may be difficult to ensure compliance. This ambiguity may force the Company to mitigate its risk by settling claims or by ending practices that generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. Currently the Company is a party to class action lawsuits. 19. Regulation of title insurance rates could adversely affect the Company 

 Title insurance rates are subject to extensive regulation, which varies from state to state. In many states the approval of the applicable state insurance regulator is required prior to implementing a rate change. These regulations could hinder the Company s ability to promptly adapt to changing market dynamics through price adjustments, which could adversely affect its results of operations, particularly in a rapidly declining market. FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 20. Failures at financial institutions at which the Company deposits funds could adversely affect the Company 

 The Company deposits substantial funds in financial institutions. These funds include amounts owned by third parties, such as escrow deposits, like-kind exchange deposits and investor, mortgagor and subservicer deposits. Should one or more of the financial institutions at which deposits are maintained fail, there is no guarantee that the Company would recover the funds deposited, whether through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage or otherwise. In the event of any such failure, the Company also could be held liable for the funds owned by third parties. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead to a heightened risk of failures of financial institutions at which the Company maintains deposits. Failures may be difficult to predict and the Company may not be able to react in a sufficiently timely manner to avoid adverse effects on the Company. 21. Unfavorable economic or other conditions could cause the Company to write off a portion of its goodwill and other intangible assets 

 The Company performs an impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on a periodic basis. Factors that may be considered in connection with this review include, without limitation, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, reductions in the Company s stock price and market capitalization, increased cost of capital and negative macroeconomic, industry and company-specific trends. These and other factors could lead to a conclusion that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, in which case the Company would be required to write off the portion believed to be impaired. Any substantial goodwill and other intangible asset impairments that may be required could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 

 45 

22. The Company s investment portfolio is subject to certain risks and could experience losses 

 The Company maintains a substantial investment portfolio, primarily consisting of fixed income debt securities. The investment portfolio also includes adjustable-rate debt securities, common and preferred stock, as well as money-market and other short-term investments. Securities in the Company s investment portfolio are subject to certain economic and financial market risks, such as credit risk, interest rate (including call, prepayment and extension) risk and/or liquidity risk. The risk of loss associated with the portfolio is increased during periods of instability in credit markets and economic conditions. Debt and equity securities are carried at fair value on the Company s balance sheet. Changes in the fair values of debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss on the balance sheet. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, where the loss is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the Company records the loss in earnings. Changes in the fair values of marketable equity securities are recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair values of securities in the Company s investment portfolio have had an adverse impact on the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, statutory surplus, financial condition and cash flow. 23. The Company s venture investment portfolio is volatile and subject to certain risks and could experience losses 

 The Company s venture investment portfolio is primarily comprised of investments in the equity of private venture-stage companies that operate in the real-estate industry and related industries (many of which offer technology-enabled products and services), investments in funds that typically invest in these same types of companies, and a similar investment that is trading publicly. The venture investment portfolio is managed independent of the Company s portfolio of debt securities and marketable equity securities, which is overseen by the Company s investment department and an investment committee. The Company may continue to make similar venture investments. These positions are concentrated in a limited number of holdings and are high-risk, illiquid investments. In certain circumstances, such as when one of these companies raises capital, merges with another company or sells itself at a valuation that is less than the valuation at which the Company made its investment or when one of these companies fails and/or liquidates itself, the Company has been and could be required to impair all or part of its investment in that company or write down the value of an investment if future growth prospects deteriorate. The prospects of these companies depend on a number of factors, including the condition of the general economy, the general availability of capital, the performance of and volatility in the public markets, the regulatory and political environments, the condition of the real estate industry, the competitive environment for such companies and the operational and financial performance of such companies. Even if one of these companies is successful, the Company s ability to realize the value of its investment may take a significant amount of time and may be dependent on the occurrence of a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or the sale of the company. Even when a liquidity event occurs, the Company may be subject to restrictions on resale or may choose to continue to hold the investment for strategic or other reasons and, as a result, the Company may not monetize the value of its investment during periods in which it could be financially advantageous to sell the investment. These investments may cause material fluctuations in the Company s quarterly results of operations due to the recognition of gains or losses in connection with observable price changes, such as from liquidity events, impairments, subsequent equity sales, or price changes in investments that begin trading publicly, which changes can be volatile. 24. Actual claims experience could materially vary from the expected claims experience reflected in the Company s reserve for incurred but not reported claims 

 The Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported IBNR claims pertaining to its title, escrow and other insurance and guarantee products. The majority of this reserve pertains to title insurance policies, which are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 65 to 75 of claim amounts become known in the first six years of the policy life, and the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the six most recent policy years. Changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years are considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. In uncertain economic times, an even larger change is more likely. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for older policy years is also possible, particularly for policy years with loss ratios exceeding historical norms. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be materially different from actual claims experience. Changes in laws or regulations impacting real estate, particularly when applied retroactively, may cause a material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent and/or older policy years. For example, the 2020 United States Supreme Court decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma calls into question the governing authority for certain real estate-related matters in Native American reservations once thought to have been disestablished. To the extent the Company, in those areas, underwrote title insurance policies or closed real estate transactions in conformity with authority that ultimately proves inapplicable, expected ultimate losses arising from those policies and transactions could change materially and could result in a material change to loss rates.

25. The Company's ability to fulfill parent company obligations and/or pay dividends may be limited 

 The Company is a holding company whose primary assets are investments in its operating subsidiaries. The Company s ability to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds. If the Company s operating subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends or repay funds, the Company may not be able to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends. Moreover, pursuant to insurance and other regulations under which the Company s insurance subsidiaries operate, the amount of dividends, loans and advances available is limited. See Item 2 MD A Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on dividend restrictions. The Company may also be required to invest capital in its subsidiaries which could further limit its ability to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends. 26. A reduction in the deposits at the Company s federal savings bank subsidiary could require the Company to borrow funds to maintain liquidity 

 The deposits of the Company s federal savings bank subsidiary consist almost entirely of funds deposited by its affiliates, the majority of which are from third parties to be held in trust pending the closing of real estate transactions. When real estate transactions decline, aggregate deposits held in trust at the Company s bank tend to decline. There is also a portion of the bank s deposits that are custodial funds held on behalf of clients of the Company s residential mortgage subservicer subsidiary. Such clients may cause their custodial funds to be moved out of the Company s bank subsidiary in connection with the transfer of ownership of mortgage servicing rights or loans, termination of subservicing contracts or otherwise. The likelihood of these clients causing funds to be moved increases as interest rates rise, which could result in a marked decline in the bank s deposits. When there is a reduction in the bank s deposits, the Company could be required to borrow funds to maintain the bank s liquidity. GENERAL RISK FACTORS 27. Certain provisions of the Company s bylaws and certificate of incorporation, as well as regulatory hurdles, may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that the Company s stockholders might consider favorable 

 The Company s bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could be considered anti-takeover provisions because they make it harder for a third-party to acquire the Company without the consent of the Company s incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions: election of the Company s board of directors is staggered such that only three or four of the directors are elected by the stockholders each year and the directors serve three year terms prior to reelection; 

 stockholders may not remove directors without cause, change the size of the board of directors or, except as may be provided for in the terms of preferred stock the Company issues in the future, fill vacancies on the board of directors; 

 stockholders may act only at stockholder meetings and not by written consent; 

 stockholders must comply with advance notice provisions for nominating directors or presenting other proposals at stockholder meetings; and 

 the Company s board of directors may without stockholder approval issue preferred shares and determine their rights and terms, including voting rights, or adopt a stockholder rights plan. 

 While the Company believes that they are appropriate, these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of approximately 67 of the Company s issued voting shares. In addition, federal banking laws and regulations and state insurance laws and regulations require third parties to obtain prior approval to acquire control of the Company due to its status as a savings and loan holding company and an insurance holding company. These provisions and regulatory requirements could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by the Company s stockholders. 28. The Company may be susceptible to claims of infringement and may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property 

 The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements, contractual provisions and systems of internal safeguards to protect its intellectual property. As the Company expands its utilization of innovative technologies, processes and techniques in the production and delivery of its products and services, the 

 47 

Company may increasingly have to litigate to enforce and protect its intellectual property rights, which may divert Company resources, cause reputational harm to the Company or result in other adverse consequences, including a loss of competitive advantage, and there is no guarantee that such protection and enforcement efforts would be successful. In addition, third parties may allege that the Company s operations or activities infringe on their intellectual property rights, including through the Company s use of software containing open source code, which may expose the Company to third-party claims of ownership of, or demands for the release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, adversely affect the Company s business. Infringement claims may give rise to litigation, which could result in damages, injunctions prohibiting the Company from providing certain products or services, entry into costly licensing arrangements or other adverse consequences.
