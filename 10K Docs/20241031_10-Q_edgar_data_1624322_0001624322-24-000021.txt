 The Bank grants loans and extensions of credit to individuals and a variety of businesses and corporations located in its general market areas throughout Louisiana and Texas. Management segregates the loan portfolio into portfolio segments which is defined as the level at which the Bank develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. The portfolio segments are segregated based on loan types and the underlying risk factors present in each loan type. Such risk factors are periodically reviewed by management and revised as deemed appropriate. 
 Portfolio Segments and Risk Factors 
 The loan portfolio is disaggregated into portfolio segments and then further disaggregated into classes for certain disclosures. GAAP defines a portfolio segment as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. A class is generally a disaggregation of a portfolio segment. The Company's loan portfolio segments are Real Estate, Commercial, and Consumer and Other. The classes and risk characteristics of each segment are discussed in more detail below. The segmentation and disaggregation of the portfolio is part of the ongoing credit monitoring process. 
 Real Estate Portfolio Segment 
 Real Estate: Commercial loans are extensions of credit secured by owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied collateral. Repayment is generally dependent on the successful operations of the property. General economic conditions may impact the performance of these types of loans, including fluctuations in the value of real estate, vacancy rates, and unemployment trends. Real estate commercial loans also include farmland loans that can be, or are, used for agricultural purposes. These loans are usually repaid through refinancing, cash flow from the borrower s ongoing operations, development of the property, or sale of the property. 
 Real Estate: Construction loans include loans to small-to-midsized businesses to construct owner-occupied properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments and, to a lesser extent, loans to individual clients for construction of single-family homes in the Company s market areas. Risks associated with these loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk and changes in market trends. The Company is also exposed to risk based on the ability of the construction loan borrower to finance the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project, which may be affected by changes in secondary market terms and criteria for permanent financing since the time that the Company funded the loan. 
 Real Estate: Residential loans include first and second lien 1-4 family mortgage loans, as well as home equity lines of credit, in each case primarily on owner-occupied primary residences. The Company is exposed to risk based on fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrower s financial condition, which could be affected by numerous factors, including divorce, job loss, illness, or other personal hardship. Real estate residential loans also include multi-family residential loans originated to provide permanent financing for multi-family residential income producing properties. Repayment of these loans primarily relies on successful rental and management of the property.

Overview 
 We are a registered financial holding company headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, b1BANK, a Louisiana state chartered bank, we provide a broad range of financial services tailored to meet the needs of small-to-midsized businesses and professionals. Since our inception in 2006, our priority has been and continues to be creating shareholder value through the establishment of an attractive commercial banking franchise in Louisiana and across our region. We consider our primary market to include the State of Louisiana, the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, and Houston. We currently operate out of banking centers and loan production offices across Louisiana and Texas. As of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 6.9 billion, total loans of 5.2 billion, total deposits of 5.6 billion, and total shareholders equity of 699.5 million. 
 As a financial holding company operating through one reportable operating segment, community banking, we generate most of our revenues from interest income on loans, customer service and loan fees, and interest income from securities. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest-earning assets and expense of our liabilities through our net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. 
 Changes in the market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions, and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in our markets and across our region, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our markets. 
 
 Other Developments 
 Bank Term Funding Program BTFP 
 On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve developed the BTFP, which offered loans to banks with a term of up to one year. The loans are secured by pledging the banks U.S. treasuries, agency securities, agency mortgage-backed securities,

 and any other qualifying assets. These pledged securities were valued at par for collateral purposes. The Bank participated in the BTFP and had outstanding debt of 300.0 million at December 31, 2023. The loans bore a fixed rate of 4.38 and matured on March 22,2024, at which time we repaid them in full. 
 Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window

The Bank has not yet drawn on either of the lines of credit as of the date of this report.

We maintained the loan portfolio and transferred those loans to other nearby banking centers. The sale included total deposits of 16.3 million and a pre-tax gain of 945,000.

Upon consummation of the acquisition, we paid 3.3 million in cash to the former owners of Waterstone. 
 Acquisition of Oakwood Bancshares, Inc. ("Oakwood") 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we consummated the merger of Oakwood Bancshares, Inc.

 Net Interest Income 
 Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, calculated as the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Fluctuations in market interest rates impact the yield and rates paid on interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities also impact net interest income. The variance driven by the changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is referred to as a volume change. Changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds are referred to as a rate change. 
 To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. We calculate average assets, liabilities, and equity using a daily average, and average yield/rate utilizing an actual day count convention. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled 56.1 million, and net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.51 and 2.54 , respectively, compared to 55.3 million, 3.61 , and 2.68 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on the loan portfolio was 7.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the average yield on total interest-earning assets was 6.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, overall cost of funds (which includes noninterest-bearing deposits) increased 48 basis points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve increasing rates during 2023. 
 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled 161.7 million, and net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.43 and 2.46 , respectively, compared to 161.4 million, 3.66 , and 2.79 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on the loan portfolio was 7.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the average yield on total interest-earning assets was 6.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.87 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall cost of funds (which includes noninterest-bearing deposits) increased 74 basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve increasing rates during 2023. 
 The following tables present, for the periods indicated, an analysis of net interest income by each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amounts outstanding and the interest earned or paid on such amounts. The table also sets forth the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. Interest earned on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is not recognized in income; however, the balances are reflected in average outstanding balances for the period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, interest income not recognized on nonaccrual loans was not material. Any nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The average total loans reflected below are net of deferred loan fees and discounts. Acquired loans were recorded at fair value at acquisition and accrete/amortize discounts and premiums as an adjustment to yield.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Our provision for credit losses is a charge to income in order to bring our allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management. For a description of the factors taken into account by management in determining the allowance for credit losses see Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses . The provision for credit losses was 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 604,000 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the provision for credit losses was 4.2 million and 4.4 million, respectively. The higher provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 relates primarily to deterioration in the economic forecast in the current period, as compared to the prior period. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, certain nonperforming loans were resolved through charge-offs, with the remaining portfolio requiring a lower reserve replenishment rate. The lower provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 relates primarily to an improved macro-economic and market outlook in the current nine-month period. Additionally, net charge-offs were elevated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the resolution of certain acquired credit deteriorated loans.

 Income Tax Expense 
 The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amounts of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense totaled 4.9 million, a decrease of 581,000, or 10.5 , compared to 5.5 million for the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 21.6 and 21.2 , respectively.

 Loan Portfolio

Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans and real estate loans secured by commercial real estate properties located in our primary market areas. Our loan portfolio represents the highest yielding component of our earning asset base.

 Real Estate: Commercial loans are extensions of credit secured by owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied collateral. Repayment is generally dependent on the successful operations of the property. General economic conditions may impact the performance of these types of loans, including fluctuations in the value of real estate, vacancy rates, and unemployment trends. Real estate commercial loans also include farmland loans that can be, or are, used for agricultural purposes. These loans are usually repaid through refinancing, cash flow from the borrower s ongoing operations, development of the property, or sale of the property. 
 Real Estate: Commercial loans increased 38.4 million or 1.7 , to 2.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 Real Estate: Construction loans include loans to small-to-midsized businesses to construct owner-occupied properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments and, to a lesser

Table of Contents 

 extent, loans to individual clients for construction of single-family homes in our market areas. Risks associated with these loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk and changes in market trends. We are also exposed to risk based on the ability of the construction loan borrower to finance the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project, which may be affected by changes in secondary market terms and criteria for permanent financing since the time we funded the loan. 
 Real Estate: Construction loans decreased 15.4 million, or 2.3 , to 654.4 million as of September 30, 2024, from 669.8 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Real Estate: Residential loans include first and second lien 1-4 family mortgage loans, as well as home equity lines of credit, in each case primarily on owner-occupied primary residences. The Company is exposed to risk based on fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrower s financial condition, which could be affected by numerous factors, including divorce, job loss, illness, or other personal hardship. Real estate residential loans also include multi-family residential loans originated to provide permanent financing for multi-family residential income producing properties. Repayment of these loans primarily relies on successful rental and management of the property. 
 Real Estate: Residential loans increased 61.5 million, or 9.0 , to 743.9 million as of September 30, 2024, from 682.4 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Commercial loans include general commercial and industrial, or C I, loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, asset acquisition, expansion, and development loans, borrowing base loans, letters of credit and other loan products, primarily in the Company s target markets that are underwritten based on the borrower s ability to service the debt from income. Commercial loan risk is derived from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. 
 Commercial loans increased 137.6 million, or 10.1 , to 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 Consumer and other loans include a variety of loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans. The risk is based on changes in the borrower s financial condition, which could be affected by numerous factors, including divorce, job loss, illness or other personal hardship, and fluctuations in the value of the real estate or personal property securing the consumer loan, if any. 
 Consumer and other loans increased 5.2 million, or 8.2 , to 69.0 million as of September 30, 2024, from 63.8 million as of December 31, 2023.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due, or interest may be recognized on a cash basis as long as the remaining book balance of the loan is deemed collectible. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
 We have several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by our bankers, and we also monitor our delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.

 We believe our conservative lending approach and focused management of nonperforming assets has resulted in sound asset quality and the timely resolution of problem assets. We had 27.8 million and 18.8 million in nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had 26.1 million in nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 17.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, is primarily due to two lending relationships secured by residential real estate, one secured by commercial real estate, and one commercial loan that is unsecured. 
 The following tables present information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:

 Potential Problem Loans 
 From a credit risk standpoint, we classify loans in one of four categories: pass, special mention, substandard or doubtful. Loans classified as loss are charged-off. The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is believed to be inherent in each credit. Our methodology is structured so that specific allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk of loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk of loss).

Table of Contents 

 Credits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness; however, such concerns are not so pronounced that we generally expect to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform within standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits with a lower rating. 
 Credits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses which exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these credits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to reduce exposure and to assure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the secondary support to the credit is performed. 
 Credits rated doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those rated substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 The following tables summarize our internal ratings of loans held for investment as of the dates indicated. See Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for the presentation of loans in their credit quality categories that is in compliance with the CECL standard.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which includes both our allowance for loan losses and reserves for unfunded commitments, that represents management s best estimate of the credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. In determining the allowance for credit losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for credit losses is based on 
 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 internally assigned risk classifications of loans, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical credit loss rates. For additional information, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 In connection with our review of the loan portfolio, we consider risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements we consider include: 
 for Real Estate: Commercial loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements), operating results of the owner in the case of owner-occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral, and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical for properties of that type; 
 for Real Estate: Construction loans, the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, the experience and ability of the developer, and the loan to value ratio; 
 for Real Estate: Residential real estate loans, the borrower s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan to value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of the collateral; and 
 for Commercial loans, the operating results of the commercial, industrial or professional enterprise, the borrower s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category, and the value, nature and marketability of collateral; 
 As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses totaled 45.0 million, or 0.86 , of total loans held for investment. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses totaled 43.7 million, or 0.88 , of total loans held for investment. 
 The following tables present, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for credit losses and other related data:

 Although we believe that we have established our allowance for credit losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and that the allowance for credit losses was adequate to provide for known and estimated losses in the portfolio at all times shown above, future provisions will be subject to ongoing evaluations of the risks in our loan portfolio. If we experience economic declines or if asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required. 
 The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for credit losses among loan categories and certain other information as of the dates indicated.

 Securities 
 We use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, an appropriate return on funds invested, manage interest rate risk, meet collateral requirements, and meet regulatory capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled 916.1 million, an increase of 36.5 million, or 4.2 , compared to 879.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains in the first nine months of 2024. Securities represented 13.3 and 13.4 of total assets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Our investment portfolio consists entirely of securities classified as available for sale. As a result, the carrying values of our investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax

 All of our mortgage-backed securities are agency securities. We do not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, corporate equity, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, subprime, Alt-A, or second lien elements in our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses encompasses potential expected credit losses related to the securities portfolio. In order to develop an estimate of credit losses expected for the current securities portfolio, we perform an assessment that includes reviewing historical loss data for both our portfolio and similar types of investment securities. Additionally, our review of the securities portfolio for expected credit losses includes an evaluation of factors including the security issuer bond ratings, delinquency status, insurance or other available credit support, as well as our expectations of the forecasted economic outlook relevant to these securities. The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm that credit loss estimates are appropriate for the securities portfolio. Based on our assessments, expected credit losses on the investment securities portfolio as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was negligible and therefore, no allowance for credit loss was recorded related to our investment securities.

 The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgage loans and other loans with varying maturities. The term of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary significantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay. Monthly paydowns on mortgage-backed securities tend to cause the average life of the securities to be much different than the stated contractual maturity. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and, consequently, the average life of this security will be lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated life of this security. The weighted average life of our investment portfolio was 4.49 years with an estimated effective duration of 3.77 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we did not own securities of any one issuer for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10 of our consolidated shareholders equity as of such respective dates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company held other equity securities of 39.6 million and 33.9 million, respectively, comprised mainly of FHLB stock, small business investment companies SBICs and financial technology Fintech fund investments. 
 Deposits 
 We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits. 
 
 Total deposits as of September 30, 2024, were 5.6 billion, an increase of 392.2 million, or 7.5 , compared to 5.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. Total uninsured deposits were 2.4 billion, or 42.4 , of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 billion, or 38.9 , of total deposits as of December 31, 2023. Since it is not reasonably practical to

 provide a precise measure of uninsured deposits, the amounts are estimated and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions that are used for regulatory reporting requirements for the call report. 
 Noninterest-bearing deposits as of September 30, 2024, were 1.2 billion compared to 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 108.1 million, or 8.3 . 
 Average deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 5.5 billion, an increase of 520.7 million, or 10.5 , over the full year average for the year ended December 31, 2023, of 5.0 billion. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits increased over this period from 3.00 for the year ended December 31, 2023, to 3.81 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in average rates was driven by the Federal Reserve raising rates during the year ended December 31, 2023 and consumer demand for higher earning interest bearing accounts. The cost of deposits increased to 2.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.15 for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The following table presents the daily average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated:

 Federal Funds Purchased Lines of Credit Relationships 
 We maintain Federal Funds Purchased Lines of Credit Relationships with the following correspondent banks and limits as of September 30, 2024: 
 Fed Funds Purchase Limits (Dollars in thousands) TIB National Association 45,000 PNC Bank 38,000 FNBB 35,000 First Horizon Bank 17,000 ServisFirst Bank 10,000 Total 145,000 
 We had no outstanding balances on these lines at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity involves our ability to utilize funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023, liquidity needs were primarily met by core deposits, security and loan maturities, and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. In addition, we also utilize, or have available, brokered deposits, purchased funds from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve discount window, and overnight advances from the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we maintained five federal funds purchased lines of credit with correspondent banks which provided for extensions of credit with an availability to borrow up to an aggregate of 145.0 million. There were no funds drawn under these lines of credit at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. We had an additional 1.2 billion of availability through the FHLB at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 921.9 million and 1.0 billion, respectively, of availability through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. 
 The following table illustrates, during the periods presented, the mix of our funding sources and the average assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of average total assets for the periods indicated. Average total assets equaled 6.7 billion and 6.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Our primary source of funds is deposits, and our primary use of funds is loans. We do not expect a change in the primary source or use of our funds in the foreseeable future. Our average net loans increased 6.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. We predominantly invest excess deposits in overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve, securities, interest-bearing deposits at other banks or other short-term liquid investments until needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio had a weighted average life of 4.49 years and an effective duration of 3.77 years as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, our securities portfolio had a weighted average life of 4.57 years and an effective duration of 3.81 years. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 1.2 billion in commitments to extend credit and 47.9 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding 1.2 billion in commitments to extend credit and 45.2 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. Because commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. See Off Balance Sheet Items below for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 we had cash and cash equivalents, including federal funds sold, of 383.2 million and 377.2 million, respectively. We had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature for either period. 
 Capital Resources 
 Total shareholders equity increased to 699.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 644.3 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 55.3 million, or 8.6 . This increase was primarily due to net income of 48.6 million and other comprehensive income of 20.4 million resulting from the after-tax effect of unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio offset with dividends paid on preferred stock and common stock of 14.8 million.

 On October 24, 2024, our Board declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of 18.75 per preferred share to the preferred shareholders of record as of November 15, 2024. The dividend is to be paid on November 30, 2024, or as soon as practicable thereafter. 
 On October 24, 2024, our Board declared a quarterly dividend based upon our financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2024, in the amount of 0.14 per common share to the common shareholders of record as of November 15, 2024. The dividend is to be paid on November 30, 2024, or as soon as practicable thereafter. 
 The declaration and payment of dividends to our shareholders, as well as the amounts thereof, are subject to the discretion of the Board and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. As a holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiary, b1BANK. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. 
 Capital management consists of providing equity to support current and future operations. Banking regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements at the holding company and bank levels. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we and b1BANK were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and b1BANK was classified as well-capitalized, for purposes of prompt corrective action regulations. As we employ our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control our growth in order to remain in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital standards applicable to us. 
 The following table presents the actual capital amounts and regulatory capital ratios for us and b1BANK as of the dates indicated.

 Bank Term Funding Program BTFP 
 On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve launched the BTFP, which offered loans to banks with a term of up to one year. The loans were secured by pledging the banks U.S. treasuries, agency securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and any other qualifying assets. These pledged securities were valued at par for collateral purposes. The Bank participated in the BTFP and had outstanding debt of 300.0 million at December 31, 2023. The loans bore a fixed rate of 4.38 and matured on March 22, 2024, at which time we repaid them in full. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The following tables summarize contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (other than non-maturity deposit obligations), which consist of future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our FHLB advances, subordinated debt, revolving line of credit, and non-cancelable future operating leases. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts. Advances from the FHLB totaled approximately 367.2 million and 211.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the FHLB advances were collateralized by a blanket floating lien on certain securities and loans, had a weighted average stated rate of 4.24 and 3.65 , respectively, and mature within ten years. We participated in the BTFP in March 2023 and as of December 31, 2023, had outstanding debt of 300.0 million, at a fixed rate of 4.38 and set to mature on March 22, 2024. We repaid this debt in full at the time of maturity. The subordinated debt totaled 99.8 million and 100.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, including premium. Of this subordinated debt, 25.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.75 through December 31, 2028 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 369 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2033, 52.5 million of this subordinated debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.25 through March 31, 2026 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 354 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2031, 3.9 million of this subordinated debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.75 through April 1, 2026 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 442 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2031. We acquired three separate notes as part of the TCBI acquisition totaling 26.4 million. Of those notes, 10.0 million bears an adjustable interest rate plus 350 basis points, based on a benchmark rate, adjusting quarterly until maturity on April 11, 2028, and callable beginning April 11, 2023, 7.5 million bears an adjustable interest rate plus 350 basis points, based on a benchmark rate, adjusting quarterly, until maturity on December 13, 2028, and callable beginning December 13, 2023, and 8.9 million, which was called on May 1, 2023 and ceased bearing interest as of such date. As part of valuing these three subordinated notes from TCBI, we incurred a fair value adjustment premium of 3.4 million that will accrete over five-to-seven years, with 890,000 and 1.1 million remaining at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We recognized 1.5 million in gains on the extinguishment of this debt during the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Off-Balance Sheet Items 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of the date indicated are summarized in the tables above. Because commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event of nonperformance by the customer, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and/or marketable securities. The credit risk to us in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to our customers. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total commitment amounts disclosed above do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if considered necessary by us, upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is sensitivity to movement in interest rates. Our asset and liability management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective interest rate risk management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We manage our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market value of equity. The objective interest rate risk management 
 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 is to measure the effect on net interest income and fair value of equity and to position the balance sheet to minimize the risk of losses and maximize the amount of income without taking on unnecessary earning volatility. 
 We seek to manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business; however, we may enter into derivative contracts to hedge interest rate risk if it is appropriate given our risk profile and policy guidelines. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the asset-liability committee ("ALCO") of b1BANK, in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model. 
 We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as prepayment assumptions, maturity data and optionality. Deposit assumptions such as repricing betas and non-maturity balance decay rates are also incorporated into the model. Model assumptions are revised and updated on a regular basis as directed by policy, and more frequently if conditions merit. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions, customer behavior, and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 On at least a quarterly basis, we run simulation models to calculate potential impacts to net interest income and the fair value of equity. Specific details of the simulations are reflected in policy as directed by ALCO. 
 The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated: 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) Percent Change in Net Interest Income Percent Change in Fair Value of Equity Percent Change in Net Interest Income Percent Change in Fair Value of Equity +300 (2.30 (3.65 (5.50 (5.59 +200 1.56 (2.25 (3.20 (3.47 +100 0.67 (1.00 (1.10 (1.39 Base - - - - -100 (1.18 0.38 0.30 1.40 -200 (2.43 (0.99 0.50 2.67 
 The results of the simulations are primarily driven by the contractual characteristics of all balance sheet instruments and customer behavior. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this statement have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.

Table of Contents 

 Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP, and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, we also evaluate our performance based on certain additional non-GAAP financial measures. We classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both. 
 This discussion and analysis section includes certain non-GAAP financial measures (e.g., referenced as core or tangible intended to supplement, not substitute for, comparable GAAP measures. These measures typically adjust income available to common shareholders for certain significant activities or transactions that in management s opinion can distort period-to-period comparisons of Business First s performance. Transactions that are typically excluded from non-GAAP measures include realized and unrealized gains/losses on former bank premises and equipment, gains/losses on sales of securities, and acquisition-related expenses (including, but not limited to, legal costs, system conversion costs, severance and retention payments, etc.). The measures also typically adjust goodwill and certain intangible assets from book value and shareholders equity. 
 Management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company s core business. These non-GAAP disclosures are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial metrics or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this statement when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Core Net Income . Core net income available to common shareholders, which excludes certain income and expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 17.2 million, or 0.68 per diluted common share, compared to core net income available to common shareholders of 18.0 million, or 0.71 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Notable noncore events impacting earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, included 319,000 in acquisition-related expenses and 511,000 in core conversion expenses, compared to 932,000 in a gain on the sale of our Leesville, Louisiana banking center and 517,000 in a gain on the extinguishment of debt due to the premium associated with the debt from the TCBI acquisition in 2022, which was attributed to the remaining 3.2 million subordinated debt redemption, for the same period in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, core net income available to common shareholders, was 46.3 million, or 1.82 per diluted common share, compared to core net income available to common shareholders of 49.5 million, or 1.96 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Notable noncore events impacting earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1.5 million in acquisition-related expenses and 511,000 in core conversion expenses, compared to 932,000 in a gain on the sale of our Leesville, Louisiana banking center, 1.5 million in a gain on the extinguishment of debt due to the premium associated with the debt from the TCBI acquisition in 2022, which was attributed to the 8.9 million subordinated debt redemption, and 173,000 in acquisition-related expenses for the same period in 2023.

 Tangible Book Value Per Common Share . Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate (1) tangible common equity as shareholders equity less preferred stock, goodwill, and core deposit and customer intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and (2) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible book value per common share is book value per common share.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Risk identification and management are essential elements for the successful management of our business. In the normal course of business, we are subject to various types of risk, including interest rate, credit, and liquidity risk. We control and monitor these risks with policies, procedures, and various levels of managerial and board oversight. Our objective is to optimize profitability while managing and controlling risk within board approved policy limits. Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of financial instruments to the magnitude, direction, and frequency of changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk results from various repricing frequencies and the maturity structure of assets and liabilities. We use our asset liability management policy to control and manage interest rate risk. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Rate Sensibility and Market Risk for additional discussion of interest rate risk. 
 Liquidity risk represents the inability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers, as well as, the obligations to depositors. We use our asset liability management policy and contingency funding plan to control and manage liquidity risk. 
 Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into certain off-balance sheet loan funding commitments. Our primary credit risk is directly related to our loan portfolio. We use our credit policy and disciplined approach to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses to control and manage credit risk. Our investment policy limits the degree of the amount of credit risk that we may assume in our investment portfolio. Our principal financial market risks are liquidity risks and exposures to interest rate movements.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or furnished under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, including to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The effectiveness of our, or any, system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. As a result, we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management evaluates our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually, and in the aggregate, and provides for potential losses on such litigation if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable. We are not currently involved in any pending legal proceedings other than routine, nonmaterial proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, we refer you to Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC. Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for December 31, 2023. 
 
 We may not achieve the interest benefits of the Oakwood Merger, and the Oakwood Merger may disrupt our existing plans or operations. 
 
 There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate Oakwood and Oakwood Bank or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the Oakwood Merger and the Oakwood Bank Merger. Difficulties in integrating Oakwood and/or Oakwood Bank may result in operational and other challenges, including an inability to realize the full extent of the intended benefits of the Oakwood Merger and the Oakwood Bank Merger and any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, expenses (including as a result of additional or unforeseen expenses) and results of operations, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock. Although we expect the strategic benefits to offset incremental transaction-related costs over time, if we are not able to adequately and effectively address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of, or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of, Oakwood and Oakwood Bank.
