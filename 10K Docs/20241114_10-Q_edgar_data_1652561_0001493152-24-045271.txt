. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the
Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stock holders, in the case of equity financing.

(c)
Credit risk 

Financial
instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivables. The Company believes the concentration
of credit risk in its accounts receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection
terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful
accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. 

(d)
Exchange rate risk 

The
Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain stable, therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post
the same amount of income for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower income
depending on exchange rate of RM converted to US and HK converted into US on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending
on changes in political and economic environments without notice.

expertise, we have successfully expanded our client base in OEM/ODM services and developed products and Business-to-business (B2B) DNA
genotyping private label services that exceed the clients expectation. 

2 

DSwiss
has continuously expanding through launching health and beauty projects to provide premier experiences to the customers. DSwiss has shown
a solid growth and is set to advance the biotechnology industry to drive nutraceutical and skincare biotechnology growth. 

At
this time, we operate exclusively online through our website: http://www.dswissbeauty.com. 

Products
which meet the definition of a functional food and cosmetics related products need to be registered or notified with the Drug Control
Authority (DCA), Ministry of Health Malaysia. Manufacturing, marketing, importation and the sale of unregistered products is a violation
of the Drug Control Regulations and Cosmetics Act 1984 of Malaysia and enforcement action can be taken. 

At
DSwiss, research and development is an ongoing effort whose purpose is to ensure our products on the forefront of quality and effectiveness.
Equipped with state of the art machinery, our innovative research and development team are constantly exploring on new development and
product lines that will enable us to provide the highest quality standard and remain competitive in the industry. 

DSwiss s

Malaysia, we strive to upkeep the highest possible standard in our products to provide assurance and as a prove of our continuing commitment
to providing quality products. 

Our
expected growth is planned to occur primarily through the implementation of our social media marketing strategy. DSwiss already has a
strong relationship with new retail tech company (eg. Facebook, E-Marketplace). The global presence social media has helped provide to
us has been an invaluable resource, and as we continue to expand our business operations and spread our brand awareness, we intend to
primarily utilize social media to reach our customers. The benefits of social media are countless, but perhaps the most imperative to
our future success is our ability to connect with customers directly, to receive their feedback almost instantaneously. On that note,
the feedback we have received from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, which has helped us to create a robust brand image. 

While
DSwiss has been focused almost exclusively upon pursuing operations within Asia, we do have plans to expand outward and become a household
name across the world. Our strategy to do so going forward is by forming partnerships with local companies in various countries that
may be willing to stock our products or promote them to their own customers. We believe that by forging strategic relationships and partnerships
we can expand our operations across the globe at a greater pace and with greater certainty than we would if we tried to expand on our
own.

ended September 30, 2023 and more than 197,015 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 respectively. We
attribute this increase in gross profits as a result of increase in revenue.

and the other costs associated with the distribution network.

Item
4 Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
