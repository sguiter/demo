 million, ounces ("Deferred Gold Consideration") of gold to be delivered in the future and a free cash flow interest. The cost support allowed for the extension of the mine from 2032 to 2035 and the potential to extend the mine life beyond 2035. 
 The value of the cash consideration and free cash flow interest received from Centerra is recorded as a deferred liability in our consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. This amount will be amortized as we provide future cost support to Centerra under the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement on a units of production basis over the Mount Milligan mine life beginning with the first cost support payment made after the First Threshold (defined below) is met. 
 The key features of the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement are discussed below. 
 Deferred Gold Consideration 
 The Deferred Gold Consideration will be delivered in equal installments of ounces for a period of 20 quarters commencing on the earlier of June 30, 2030, or the delivery of ounces of gold or tonnes of copper from metal deliveries referenced by the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement with a bill of lading date on or after January 1, 2024. As part of the Deferred Gold Consideration, we are entitled to receive tranches of ounces each (the "Greenstone Deliveries"), with the last delivery expected before year end 2027. Each of the Greenstone Deliveries received shall reduce the number of ounces in any remaining Deferred Gold Consideration delivery on a pro-rata basis. The Deferred Gold Consideration deliveries require no cash payment from the Company, and will be made irrespective of the operating status of Mount Milligan as long as we comply with the terms of the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement and existing stream agreement. Each of the Greenstone Deliveries will be delivered to Royal Gold within days of such delivery to Centerra. 
 When the Deferred Gold Consideration is received and subsequently sold, we anticipate the value of the gold ounces sold will be recorded as a deferred liability and amortized on a units of production basis over the mine life of Mount Milligan as we provide future cost support.

 ounces of gold or tonnes of copper from the Reference Date (the First Threshold ). 
 b. ounces of gold or tonnes of copper from the Reference Date (the Second Threshold ). 
 Near-Term Cost Support Through Approximately 2029 
 At Centerra s request, in the event that both the gold price is at or below per ounce and the copper price is at or below per pound, for each delivery under the existing Mount Milligan stream agreement, we will pay the lower of either per ounce of gold, or of the spot gold price less per ounce, and of the spot copper price for each pound of copper delivered (the Pre-Threshold Support ). This near-term cost support will be made available from the Reference Date through to the First Threshold, which is expected to be through approximately 2029. 
 Any Pre-Threshold Support we provide will be recoverable from any cost support calculated after the First Threshold at metal prices above per ounce of gold and per pound of copper. For gold, any cost support payment will be reduced by the difference between the gold price and per ounce. For copper, any cost support payment will be reduced by the difference between the copper price and per pound. 
 Cost Support from Approximately 2030 Through Approximately 2035 
 We will provide Centerra cost support payments from the First Threshold until the Second Threshold as follows: 
 a. With respect to gold, the lower of either per ounce, or of the spot gold price less per ounce, for each ounce of gold delivered under the existing Mount Milligan stream agreement. 
 b. With respect to copper, of the spot copper price for each pound of copper delivered under the existing Mount Milligan stream agreement. 
 Cost Support After Approximately 2036 
 We will provide Centerra cost support payments after the Second Threshold as follows: 
 a. With respect to gold, the lower of either per ounce, or of the spot gold price less per ounce, for each ounce of gold delivered under the existing Mount Milligan stream agreement. 
 b. With respect to copper, of the spot copper price, for each pound of copper delivered. 
 Suspension of Cost Support 
 Our obligation to make long-term cost support payments will be suspended if (and for so long as) Centerra discloses reserve tonnage which, when combined with mining depletion from the Reference Date to the date of such disclosure, is less than the current reserves expected to be processed through to 2035. Suspension of cost support payments will not impact the Deferred Gold Consideration and free cash flow interest, and the cash consideration is not refundable as long as we comply with the terms of the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement and the existing stream agreement. 
 Nothing in the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement modifies the existing stream agreement, including the payment of for each gold ounce delivered and of the spot price for each pound of copper delivered.

 and (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective streaming agreement and our sales policy in effect at the time), commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. We settle both averaging and spot sales contracts via physical delivery of the metal to the purchaser (our customer) on the settlement date specified in the contract. Under our sales contracts, there is a single performance obligation to sell a contractually specified volume of metal to the purchaser, and we satisfy this obligation at the point in time of physical delivery. Accordingly, revenue from our metal sales is recognized on the date of settlement, which is the date that control, custody and title to the metal transfer to the purchaser. 
 Royalty Interests 
 Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. We are entitled to payment for our royalty interest in a mining project based on a contractually specified commodity price (for example, a monthly or quarterly average spot price) for the period in which metal production occurs. As a royalty holder, we act as a passive entity in the production and operations of the mining project, and the third-party operator of the mining project is responsible for all mining activities, including subsequent marketing and delivery of all metal production to their ultimate customer. In all of our material royalty interest arrangements, we have concluded that we transfer control of our interest in the metal production to the operator at the point at which production occurs, and thus, the operator is our customer. We have further determined that the transfer of each unit of metal production comprising our royalty interest to the operator represents a separate performance obligation under the contract, and each performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time of metal production by the operator. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to our royalty interests in the period in which metal production occurs at the specified commodity price per the agreement, net of any contractually allowable costs. 
 Royalty Revenue Estimates 
 For a small number of our royalty interests, we may not receive, or be entitled to receive, payment information, including production information from the operator, for the period in which metal production occurred prior to issuance of our financial statements for that period. As a result, we may estimate revenue for these royalties based on available information, including public information, from the operator. If adequate information is not available from the operator or from other public sources before we issue our financial statements, we will recognize royalty revenue during the period in which the necessary payment information is received. Differences between estimates and actual amounts could differ significantly and are recorded in the period that the actual amounts are known. Please also refer to our Use of Estimates accounting policy discussed in our 2023 10-K. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, royalty revenue that was estimated or was attributable to metal production for a period prior to September 30, 2024, was not material. 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 We have identified material revenue sources in our business: stream interests and royalty interests. These identified revenue sources are consistent with our reportable segments as discussed in Note 10.

Newmont Corporation and the Union reached a definitive agreement on October 13, 2023 and Pe asquito's operations reached full operating capacity by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 General Presentation 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of Royal Gold. You should read this MD A in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 15, 2024 2023 10-K ). 
 This MD A contains forward-looking information. You should review our important note about forward-looking statements following this MD A. 
 We do not own, develop, or mine the properties on which we hold stream or royalty interests. Certain information provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q about operating properties in which we hold interests, including information about mineral resources and reserves, historical production, production estimates, property descriptions, and property developments, was provided to us by the operators of those properties or is publicly available information filed by these operators with applicable securities regulatory bodies, in certain cases including the SEC. We have not verified, and are not in a position to verify, and expressly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or fairness of, this third-party information and refer the reader to the public reports filed by the operators for information regarding those properties. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references to Royal Gold, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Royal Gold, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview of Our Business 
 We acquire and manage precious metal streams, royalties, and similar interests. We seek to acquire existing stream and royalty interests or finance projects that are in production or in the development stage in exchange for stream or royalty interests. 
 We manage our business under two segments: 
 Acquisition and Management of Stream Interests A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right and obligation to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we owned nine stream interests, which are on seven producing properties and two development stage properties. Stream interests accounted for approximately 69 of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 71 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect stream interests to continue representing a significant portion of our total revenue. 
 Acquisition and Management of Royalty Interests Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. As of September 30, 2024, we owned royalty interests on 33 producing properties, 17 development stage properties and 116 exploration stage properties, of which we consider 50 to be evaluation stage projects. We use evaluation stage to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineral resources and on which operators are engaged in the search for mineral reserves. Royalty interests accounted for 31 of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 29 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests, and we generally are not required to contribute to capital costs, exploration costs, environmental costs or other operating costs on those properties. 
 We are continually reviewing opportunities to grow our portfolio, whether through the creation or acquisition of new or existing stream or royalty interests or other acquisition activity. We generally have acquisition opportunities in various stages of review. Our review process may include, for example, engaging consultants and advisors to analyze an opportunity; analysis of technical, financial, legal, environmental, social, governance and other confidential information regarding an opportunity; submission of indications of interest and term sheets; participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations; and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes.

Business Trends and Uncertainties 
 Metal Prices 
 Our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold, silver, copper, and other metals. Metal prices have fluctuated widely in recent years and we expect this volatility to continue. The marketability and price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, and significant changes in metal prices can have a material effect on our revenue. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, average metal prices and percentages of revenue by metal were as follows:

 Recent Developments 
 Back River Royalties Acquisition 
 On June 26, 2024, International Royalty Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, acquired a 0.7 net smelter return royalty (the "Hill Royalty") that declines by 50 after 5 million Canadian dollars in royalty revenue is received, and a 26.25 interest in a 5 gross smelter return ("GSR") royalty (the "KM Royalty") that is payable after approximately 780,000 ounces have been produced on the Back River Gold Project ("Back River") for aggregate cash consideration of 51 million. Payments for the Hill Royalty are deductible from the KM Royalty. When considered together, the royalty interests are equivalent to an approximate effective 1.1 GSR royalty rate over the majority of the mine life. Back River is operated by B2Gold Corporation and is located in Western Nunavut, Canada. Refer to Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the Back River royalties acquisition. 
 
 Property Developments 
 This section provides recent updates for our principal properties as reported by the operators, either directly to us or in their publicly available documents. 
 Stream Interests 
 Andacollo 
 Gold stream deliveries from Andacollo were approximately 5,200 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 9,300 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in deliveries was primarily due to lower tonnes milled as a result of water restrictions caused by extreme drought conditions earlier in the year. Stream deliveries typically occur approximately six months after mine production and are based on a fixed payability factor of 89 . 
 On October 24, 2024, Teck Resources Limited reported improved mill throughput in the September 2024 quarter driven by increased water availability. 
 Khoemac a u 
 Silver stream deliveries from Khoemac a u were approximately 288,200 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 315,000 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in 
 20 

deliveries in the current period primarily resulted from lower tonnage milled. Stream deliveries are based on a fixed payability factor of 90 and typically occur 1 to 2 months after mine production. 
 On October 24, 2024, MMG Limited MMG reported improved mining and milling volumes and higher ore grades at Zone 5 during the September 2024 quarter compared to the previous quarter. According to MMG, operations were enhanced due to the gradual onboarding of skilled labor and increased availability of equipment, and the mining sequence allowed access to higher-grade areas. Improved controls on dilution also supported the increase in ore mined grades. MMG also reported that underground development advance increased by 25 during the quarter, which MMG expects will lead to greater mining volumes, access to higher-grade mining areas, and will increase mining flexibility in the near and medium term. 
 MMG also reported that it expects production at Zone 5 to further ramp up over the next year, and that it is committed to accessing the higher-grade areas to achieve an annual production of 60,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate by 2026. This will be facilitated by ongoing mining development efforts to increase mining fronts, operational flexibility and access to higher-grade areas. These efforts will be further enhanced by constructing a paste fill plant to increase extraction rates and completion of the installation of primary vent fans. 
 MMG plans to expand total production capacity at Khoemac a u to 130,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate per annum by building a new 4.5 million tonne per annum process plant, increasing Zone 5 output, and developing additional deposits. MMG expects to begin the expansion feasibility study by the end of 2024, with construction to begin in 2026, production of first concentrate in 2028, and full capacity reached by 2029. Any expanded production from the Zone 5 and Mango NE deposits falls within the area of interest covered by our silver stream. 
 Mount Milligan 
 Gold stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 22,100 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 13,000 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Copper stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 3.9 million pounds during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 2.4 million pounds during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in deliveries was primarily due to increased mill throughput, as well as higher gold grade earlier in 2024. Stream metal deliveries typically occur approximately six months after mine production. Gold stream deliveries are based on a fixed payability factor of 97 and copper stream deliveries are based on a minimum payability factor of 95 . 
 On October 31, 2024, Centerra Gold Inc. ("Centerra") reported that 2024 production guidance at the Mount Milligan mine in British Columbia remains unchanged at 180,000 to 200,000 ounces of gold and 55 to 65 million pounds of copper, with gold production trending towards the lower end of the range. 
 Centerra also reported that work continued on the site-wide optimization program, and notable achievements during the first nine months of 2024 include an improved safety record, increased availability and utilization of the haul fleet, and consistent ore supply which has led to increased mill throughput per operating day. In addition, Centerra is progressing work on a preliminary economic assessment PEA to evaluate the substantial mineral resources at Mount Milligan with a goal to unlock additional value beyond its current 2035 mine life. Centerra expects the PEA to be completed towards the end of the first half of 2025. 
 Pueblo Viejo 
 Gold stream deliveries from Pueblo Viejo were approximately 6,000 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 5,000 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gold deliveries was primarily due to increased throughput in the current period. Gold stream deliveries are based on a fixed payability factor of 99.9 . 
 Silver stream deliveries were approximately 89,600 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 171,100 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in silver deliveries was primarily due to lower silver recoveries, partially offset by higher throughput. Silver stream deliveries are based on a fixed payability factor of 99.0 . Deliveries are quarterly and typically occur 1 to 3 months after mine production. 
 On October 16, 2024, Barrick Gold Corporation reported that Pueblo Viejo delivered a 23 improvement in gold production in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 due to continued plant optimization.

Royalty Interests 
 Cortez 
 Production attributable to our royalty interest at the Cortez Complex was approximately 161,800 ounces of gold for the three months ended September 30, 2024, of which 45,300 ounces were attributable to the Legacy Zone, and 116,500 ounces were attributable to the CC Zone, compared to approximately 218,800 ounces of gold for the three months ended September 30, 2023, of which 98,800 ounces were attributable to the Legacy Zone, and 120,000 ounces were attributable to the CC Zone. 
 Pe asquito 
 Production attributable to our royalty interest at Pe asquito was approximately 55,700 ounces of gold, 5.7 million ounces of silver, 36.4 million pounds of lead and 133.6 million pounds of zinc for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, no royalty production from Pe asquito was reported due to the suspension of operations resulting from a labor strike that was subsequently resolved in October 2023. 
 October 18, 2024, Newmont Corporation ("Newmont") reported that it had agreed on a new Collective Bargain Agreement CBA for 2024-2026 with the National Union of Mining, Metallurgical, Steel, and Similar Workers of Mexico. According to Newmont, this CBA provides a solid foundation for continuing operations at Pe asquito. 
 On October 23, 2024, Newmont reported that it delivered steady gold, silver, lead and zinc production in the current quarter from the Chile Colorado pit and commenced mining ore in the higher gold grade Pe asco pit, ahead of plan due to efficient stripping. Newmont expects this will result in an increase in gold production in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Quarter Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income and comprehensive income attributable to Royal Gold stockholders net income of 96.2 million, or 1.46 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of 49.3 million, or 0.75 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher revenue and lower interest expense, each discussed below. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized total revenue of 193.8 million, comprised of stream revenue of 133.1 million and royalty revenue of 60.8 million at an average gold price of 2,474 per ounce, an average silver price of 29.43 per ounce and an average copper price of 4.18 per pound. This is compared to total revenue of 138.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, comprised of stream revenue of 99.0 million and royalty revenue of 39.6 million, at an average gold price of 1,928 per ounce, an average silver price of 23.57 per ounce and an average copper price of 3.79 per pound. Revenue and the corresponding production attributable to our stream and royalty interests for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, are as follows:

 (2) Refer to Property Developments above for a discussion of recent developments at principal properties. 
 (3) Individually, no stream or royalty included within the Other category contributed greater than 10 of our total revenue for either period. 
 The increase in our total revenue resulted primarily from higher average gold, silver and copper prices compared to the prior period. Higher gold sales from Mount Milligan, higher gold and silver sales from Pueblo Viejo, higher gold, silver, zinc and lead production from Pe asquito and new revenue of 12.6 million from non-principal royalties also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower gold sales from Andacollo, lower production from the Cortez Legacy Zone and lower silver sales from Khoemac a u when compared to the prior year period.

 _______________________________________________ 
 (1) Pueblo Viejo silver purchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024 do not include 115,600 ounces of silver permitted to be deferred based on the terms of the Pueblo Viejo silver stream agreement. Total deferred silver ounces were 1.2 million ounces at September 30, 2024, and the timing for the delivery of this deferred amount is uncertain. 
 Cost of sales, which excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, increased to 27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 21.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase, when compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to higher gold, silver and copper prices, higher gold sales from Mount Milligan and higher silver sales from Pueblo Viejo. The increase was partially offset by lower gold sales from Andacollo and lower silver sales from Khoemac a u compared to the prior year period. Cost of sales is specific to our stream agreements and, except for Mount Milligan, is the result of our purchase of metal for a cash payment that is a set contractual percentage of the spot price for that metal near the date of metal delivery. For Mount Milligan, the cash payments under the existing stream agreement are the lesser of 435 per ounce or the prevailing market price of gold when purchased and 15 of the spot price for copper near the date of metal delivery. Separately, and in addition to the cash payments under the existing stream agreement, the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement detailed in Note 5 of our notes to consolidated financial statements provides for cash payments on gold and copper deliveries that are expected to begin after certain thresholds are met or earlier, if metal prices are below certain thresholds and if requested by Centerra Gold Inc. ("Centerra"). 
 General and administrative costs increased to 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher non-cash stock compensation expense compared to the prior year period. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased to 36.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 40.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower stream depletion rates as a result of proven and probable mineral reserve increases by our operators when compared to the prior year period, lower silver sales from Khoemac a u, lower gold sales from Andacollo and lower gold production at Cortez compared to the prior year period. The decrease was partially offset by higher gold sales from Mount Milligan and higher gold and silver sales from Pueblo Viejo. 
 24 

Interest and other expense decreased to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense as a result of lower average amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility compared to the prior year period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility averaged 14 million at an average all-in borrowing rate of 6.5 compared to average amounts outstanding of 380 million at an average all-in borrowing rate of 6.7 for the prior year period. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 21.5 million, compared to 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax expense resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.3 in the current period, compared with 17.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The higher income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher income before income taxes compared to the prior year period. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income of 224.6 million, or 3.41 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of 176.7 million, or 2.69 per basic and 2.68 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher revenue, lower debt-related interest expense and lower depletion expense compared to the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by higher tax expense, as discussed below. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized total revenue of 516.8 million, comprised of stream revenue of 358.5 million and royalty revenue of 158.3 million at an average gold price of 2,296 per ounce, an average silver price of 27.22 per ounce and an average copper price of 4.14 per pound. This is compared to total revenue of 453.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, comprised of stream revenue of 320.0 million and royalty revenue of 133.1 million, at an average gold price of 1,931 per ounce, an average silver price of 23.40 per ounce and an average copper price of 3.89 per pound. Revenue and the corresponding production attributable to our stream and royalty interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, are as follows:

 (1) Pueblo Viejo silver purchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 do not include 381,700 ounces of silver permitted to be deferred based on the terms of the Pueblo Viejo silver stream agreement. Total deferred silver ounces were 1.2 million ounces at September 30, 2024, and the timing for the delivery of this deferred amount is uncertain. 
 Cost of sales, which excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, increased to 73.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 69.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher gold sales from Xavantina and Wassa, partially offset by lower silver sales from Khoemac a u and lower gold sales from Andacollo compared to the prior year period. Cost of sales is specific to our stream agreements and, except for Mount Milligan, is the result of our purchase of metal for a cash payment that is a set contractual percentage of the spot price for that metal near the date of metal delivery.

 General and administrative costs increased to 32.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 30.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher non-cash stock compensation expense compared to the prior year period. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased to 110.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 124.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower stream depletion rates, as a result of proven and probable mineral reserve increases by our operators when compared to the prior year period, lower gold sales from Andacollo, lower silver sales from Khoemac a u and lower gold production from the Cortez Legacy Zone. 
 Interest and other expense decreased to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense as a result of lower

average amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility compared to the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility averaged 109 million at an average all-in borrowing rate of 6.5 , compared to average amounts outstanding of 421 million at an average all-in borrowing rate of 6.4 for the prior year period. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 67.5 million, compared with income tax expense of 28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax expense resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.1 in the current period, compared with 13.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024, included a 13.0 million discrete U.S. GILTI income tax expense related to consideration received from the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a discrete tax benefit of 8.5 million attributable to the release of a valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 At September 30, 2024, we had current assets of 202.1 million compared to current liabilities of 86.3 million, which resulted in working capital of 115.8 million. This compares to current assets of 167.4 million and current liabilities of 72.4 million at December 31, 2023, resulting in working capital of 95 million. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in our available cash, which primarily resulted from higher net cash proceeds from our stream and royalty interests and cash proceeds received for the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement, partially offset by the 51 million Back River royalties acquisition during the current year. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, liquidity needs were met from 388.5 million in net cash provided by operating activities and our available cash resources. Working capital, combined with available capacity under our revolving credit facility, resulted in approximately 1.1 billion of total liquidity at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with each financial covenant under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 4 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and below under Recent Liquidity Developments for further discussion on our debt. 
 We believe that our current financial resources and funds generated from operations will be adequate to cover anticipated expenditures for debt service and general and administrative expense costs for the foreseeable future. Our current financial resources are also available to fund dividends and for acquisitions of stream and royalty interests, including any conditional funding schedules. Our long-term capital requirements are primarily affected by our ongoing acquisition activities. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review. In the event of one or more substantial stream or royalty interest or other acquisitions, we may seek additional debt or equity financing as necessary. We occasionally borrow and repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and may do so in the future. 
 Please refer to our risk factors included in Part 1, Item 1A of our 2023 10-K for a discussion of certain risks that may impact our liquidity and capital resources. 
 Recent Liquidity Developments 
 Revolving Credit Facility Repayment 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid the remaining 50 million of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, making the entire 1.0 billion revolving credit facility available as of September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 388.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 314.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase, when compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to net cash proceeds received from our stream and royalty interests of 34.6 million, cash proceeds of 24.5 million received for the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement, lower debt cash interest payments of 16.0 million, and 12.0 million of interest from the repayment of the Khoemac a u debt facility. This increase was partially offset by higher cash taxes of 11.4 million when compared to the prior year period. 
 28 

Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities totaled 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the 51.2 million in aggregate consideration paid for the acquisition of two royalties at Back River. The increase was partially offset by the 25 million principal repayment on the Khoemac a u subordinated debt facility during the current period. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled 334.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 327.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in dividend payments made when compared to the prior year.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report and our other public communications include forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from these statements. 
 Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like will, may, could, should, would, believe, estimate, expect, anticipate, plan, forecast, potential, intend, continue, project, or negatives of these words or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the following: our expected financial performance and outlook, including sales volume, revenue, expenses, tax rates, earnings, and cash flows; operators expected operating and financial performance and other anticipated developments relating to their properties and operations, including production, deliveries, estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves, environmental and feasibility studies, technical reports, mine plans, capital requirements, liquidity, and capital expenditures; opportunities for acquisitions and other transactions; anticipated benefits from acquisitions and other transactions; receipt and timing of future metal deliveries, including deferred amounts at Pueblo Viejo; the timing and amount of future benefits and obligations in connection with the Mount Milligan Cost Support Agreement; anticipated liquidity, capital resources, financing, and stockholder returns; and prices for gold, silver, copper, and other metals. 
 Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: changes in the price of gold, silver, copper, or other metals; operating activities or financial performance of properties on which we hold stream or royalty interests, including variations between actual and forecasted performance, operators ability to complete projects on schedule and as planned, operators changes to mine plans and mineral reserves and mineral resources (including updated mineral reserve and mineral resource information), liquidity needs, mining and environmental hazards, labor disputes, distribution and supply chain disruptions, permitting and licensing issues, other adverse government or court actions, or operational disruptions; changes of control of properties or operators; contractual issues involving our stream or royalty agreements; the timing of deliveries of metals from operators and our subsequent sales of metal; risks associated with doing business in foreign countries; increased competition for stream and royalty interests; environmental risks, including those caused by climate change; potential cyber-attacks, including ransomware; our ability to identify, finance, value, and complete acquisitions or other transactions; adverse economic and market conditions; impact of health epidemics and pandemics; changes in laws or regulations governing us, operators, or operating properties; changes in management and key employees; and other risk factors described in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2023 10-K. Most of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report or our other reports could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our earnings and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold and other metals. Gold, silver, copper, and other metal prices can fluctuate significantly and are affected by numerous factors, such as demand, production levels, economic policies of central banks, producer hedging, world political and economic events, inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. Please see the risk factor entitled Our revenue is subject to volatility in metal prices, which could negatively affect our results of operations or cash flow , under Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 10-K, for more information about risks associated with metal price volatility. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported revenue of 516.8 million, with an average gold price for the period of 2,296 per ounce, an average silver price of 27.22 per ounce, and an average copper price of 4.14 per pound. The table below shows the impact that a 10 increase or decrease in the average price of the specified metal would have had on our total reported revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Metal Percentage of Total Reported Revenue Associated with Specified Metal Amount by Which Total Reported Revenue Would Have Increased or Decreased If Price of Specified Metal Had Averaged 10 Higher or Lower in Period Gold 75 37.8 million Silver 13 3.8 million Copper 9 8.7 million 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial and accounting officer), we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Royal Gold have been detected.

 None. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The following risk factor supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors included in the section entitled Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K. 
 
 30 

We have limited access to the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests and to information concerning the properties, which makes it more difficult for us to project or assess the performance of our stream and royalty interests and confirm information provided by the operators concerning the properties including mineral resources and mineral reserves, and our ability to disclose mineral resources and mineral reserves for the properties is limited by the SEC. 
 Our stream and royalty agreements provide us with limited access and information rights concerning the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests. Operators generally provide us with limited information on mine production relating to the properties that are subject to our interests. Our access to additional property information depends upon the terms of the contracts that underlay our stream and royalty interests, which terms vary significantly among properties. In circumstances where we do receive additional property information, we do not have access to drilling, metallurgical, permitting, development, production, operating, or other data in sufficient detail, nor do we have access to properties, sufficient to confirm disclosure from the operators, including verifying mineral resources and mineral reserves disclosed by the operators. As a result, we generally rely on the operators disclosures and/or limited information provided to us by the operators for the information we use in monitoring our interests and in preparing our public disclosure. 
 Because we have limited information concerning the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests, it may be difficult for us to project or assess the performance of a stream or royalty interest. Also, we generally are unable to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, or fairness of the information provided to us, or disclosed, by operators and that we use in monitoring our interests and preparing our public disclosure. Any actions we take based on inaccurate or incomplete information from operators could negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The correction of inaccurate or incomplete information from operators could also cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 In addition, because of our limited access and information rights concerning the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests, qualified persons on behalf of the Company are not able to arrive at sufficient findings and conclusions, or prepare adequate supporting documentation, for us to disclose mineral resources or mineral reserves for the properties in which we hold interests. Previously, we disclosed mineral resources and mineral reserves as reported by the operators of the properties because such disclosure represented information that we had in our possession and that we believed was responsive to the disclosure obligations set forth in Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K SK 1300 ). We subsequently received a comment letter from the staff of the SEC s Division of Corporation Finance, and in the resulting correspondence and discussions with the staff, the staff informed us that we are not able to rely on disclosure of mineral resources and mineral reserves by the operators of the properties as a basis for our disclosure of mineral resources and mineral reserves under SK 1300, and the staff further interprets SK 1300 to preclude in SEC filings the supplemental disclosure of mineral resources and mineral reserves that do not satisfy the standards for disclosure established by SK 1300. As a result, we anticipate that we will amend our 2023 Form 10-K to remove some or all of the disclosure of mineral resources and mineral reserves for the properties in which we hold interests, and that we will similarly exclude such disclosure from future Form 10-K and other SEC filings. While we will continue to include fulsome disclosure of all mineral resources and mineral reserves attributable to our interests on our website and in other public disclosure outside of our SEC filings, the removal of some or all mineral resources and mineral reserves from our SEC filings may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business, particularly in the context of registered offerings of securities.
