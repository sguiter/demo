In a strategic restructuring, during October 2022,
our Board of Directors (the Board approved the divestiture of the former ACO/MSO Division, including Cura Health Management
LLC CHM and its subsidiary ACO Health Partners LLC AHP ). CHM and AHP were involved in enhancing coordinated
care through the Medicare Shared Savings Program MSSP ). The divestiture was completed on January 17, 2023, aligning with

fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with the accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2023

or have access to, the audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure
needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending December 31, 2024. 

On a consolidated basis, the Company s operations

of its shares of common stock, par value per share, at the Company s request any time during the three-year
commitment period set forth in the SEPA. Because the purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville for the shares of common stock sold
by the Company to Yorkville pursuant to the SEPA, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of the Company s common stock
during the applicable pricing period, the Company cannot reliably predict the actual purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville
for those shares, or the actual gross proceeds to be raised by the Company from those sales, if any. During the nine months ended September

The fair value of contingent
consideration receivable was determined using an expected present value approach, which applies a discount rate to a probability-weighted
stream of net cash flows based on multiple scenarios, as estimated by management. As such, the fair values of contingent consideration
receivable rely on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions and there is uncertainty in the expected future cash flows used in
the fair valuation. Significant assumptions related to the valuation of contingent consideration receivable include the likelihood of
a Buyer IPO, the valuation of the Buyer s common stock in a potential IPO, the likelihood that AHP would meet its performance benchmarks
to the extent that it will receive shared savings for plan year 2022, the likelihood that AHP under the management of the Buyer would
receive sufficient shared savings in plan years 2023 and/or 2024 to pay the Physician Advance Consideration, and the likelihood that the

As a result of the full impairment of the NCFM
medical database during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as described below, there is no expected future amortization

Impairment of NCFM Medical Database 
2024 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company determined that triggering events had occurred that required an impairment assessment of the NCFM Medical Database. The triggering
events included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2024, including a decline compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2023 and a decline compared to the preceding three month period ended June 30, 2024, (ii) substantial operating losses
and negative cash flows generated from the practice during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the first time since its acquisition,
and (iii) substantial downsizing of the practice personnel and overhead. The Company does not believe that the levels of revenue and profitability
achieved since acquisition of NCFM in 2019 are reasonably likely to return to the extent that projected cash flows from the practice can
substantiate the carrying value of the NCFM Medical Database.

loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit s carrying value over its fair value. The Company determined that the carrying

Revenue 

Patient service revenue decreased
by 748,671, or 59 year-over-year, from 1,271,466 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 522,795 in the three months ended
September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of (i) a 65 year-over-year decrease at our NCFM practice of 677,092 due to changes in clinical
staffing that saw the departure of three physicians in 2023, two of which have been replaced, (ii) a 45 decrease at our NWC practice
facility of 66,434 due to the departure of a half-time physician, and (iii) an 88 year-over-year decrease at our AEU practice of 26,360
due to the departure of our primary half-time physician and attrition from the practice, offset by (iv) a 43 increase of 21,214 at our
BTG practice. The reduction in revenue was offset in part by a corresponding designed reduction in practice operating costs as described
below in the fluctuation of Practice salaries and benefits and Other practice operating costs, which declined
by a combined 502,257 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the same period of 2024. While we plan for patient service revenue
to increase in future periods from levels realized in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as we plan to add additional physicians
and continue patient marketing and retention efforts, there is no guarantee that such increases will occur. 

Subscription revenue in the
three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 13,793, or 74 year-over-year, to 32,367, from 18,574, due primarily to an increase
in HealthLynked Network paid subscriptions that were paired with NCFM membership contracts compared to the same period in 2023. 

Product revenue was 34,962
in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 42,475 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7,513,
or 18 . Product revenue was earned by the Medical Distribution Division, comprised of the operations of MOD, which decreased due to reduced
marketing efforts and demand for our products at our offered price points. 

Operating Expenses and Costs 

Practice salaries and benefits
decreased by 322,657, or 42 , to 449,759 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 772,416 in the three months ended
September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of focused cost reduction efforts at all of our practices starting in mid-2023 and continuing
through mid-2024. 

Other practice operating costs
decreased by 179,600 or 34 , to 349,467 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 529,067 in the three months ended September
30, 2023, primarily as a result of focused cost reduction efforts at all of our practices starting in mid-2023 and continuing through
mid-2024. 

Cost of product revenue was
 31,674 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9,146, or 22 , compared to 40,820 in the same period of 2023, corresponding
to the decline in product sales for the period compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Selling, general and administrative
costs decreased by 135,877, or 18 , to 631,829 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 767,705 in the three months
ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower payroll, legal and accounting costs, and stock-based compensation costs. 

Depreciation and amortization
in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 4,649, or 5 , to 82,743 compared to 87,392 in the three months ended September
30, 2023, primarily as a result of certain fixed asset reaching the end of their depreciable lives during 2023. 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company determined that triggering events had occurred that required an impairment assessment of the NCFM Medical
Database. The triggering events included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2024, including a 65 decline compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a 35 decline compared to the preceding three month period ended June 30, 2024, (ii)
substantial operating losses and negative cash flows generated from the practice during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for
the first time since its acquisition, and (iii) substantial downsizing of the practice personnel and overhead. We determined that the
carrying amount of the reporting unit, which consists of the NCFM practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded
an impairment charge in the amount of 716,000 to adjust carrying value of the NCFM Medical Database to its estimated fair value of -0-
in the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we determined that triggering events had
occurred that required impairment assessments of goodwill related to our AEU business. The triggering events included (i) a material decline
in revenue during third quarter 2023, and (ii) an inability of the business to achieve profitability since its acquisition. We determined
that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, which consists of the AEU practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we
recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 319,958 to adjust carrying value of AEU goodwill to its estimated fair value of -0- in
the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss from operations increased
by 486,504, or 41 , to 1,671,347 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,184,843 in the three months ended September
30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher impairment charge along with decreased revenue in 2024, offset in part by reduced practice operating
costs and corporate overhead costs. 

47 

Other Income (Expenses) 

Loss on extinguishment of
debt in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,580. Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2024 resulted from the net impact of the
extension of the maturity date of two maturing note payable to Dr. Dent in exchange for the issuance of warrants. There were no such losses
in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gains from the change in fair
value of debt was 65,344 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to three notes payable to Dr. Michael Dent that were recorded
at fair value following extension of the maturity dates of the notes. These notes are revalued at their fair value at the end of each
period, with the changes recorded as gains or losses from the change in fair value of debt. There were no such gains or losses in the
three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gain from expiration of liability
classified equity instruments was 92,641 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and resulted from the expiration of liability-classified
warrants issued in 2020. There were no such gains or losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Amortization of original issue
and debt discounts on notes payable and convertible notes in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 322,141, an increase of 189,986,
or 144 , compared to 132,155 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization of discounts arose from original issue discounts
on notes payable, warrants attached to notes payable, and beneficial conversion features in convertible notes payable. The increase was
due to higher notes payable balances and larger equity-based and original issue discounts offered for new notes payable, primarily to
our CEO, Dr. Dent, and therefore larger corresponding amortizable discount balances in 2024 compared to 2023. 

Gain from realization of contingent
sale consideration receivable was -0-, a decrease of 1,075,857, or 100 compared to a gain of 1,075,857 in the three months ended September
30, 2023. The gain in 2023 resulted from actual proceeds received during the period from contingent sale consideration related to the
sale of AHP in excess of the amount estimated to be received at the time of the sale in January 2023. Receipts during the three months
ended September 30, 2023 included 450,000 gross 360,000 net) in Incremental Cash Consideration and 1,873,993 gross 1,186,231 net)
from the 2022 MSSP Consideration. There were no receipts of such consideration during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Gain from the change in fair
value of contingent acquisition consideration decreased by 3,341, or 69 , to 1,478 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 4,819 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. These gains relate to the fourth and final year of the MOD earnout, which is based
on the performance of our Medical Distribution Division in calendar year 2024 and is projected to have no required payout based on the
2024 performance of the MOD business. 

Interest expense increased
by 31,344, or 177 , to 49,033 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17,689 in the three months ended September
30, 2023, due to an increase in interest-bearing notes payable to related parties and third parties during 2024, primarily in the form
of new notes and convertible notes payable to Dr. Dent. 

Total other income (expenses)
increased by 1,325,425, or 129 , to net expense of 301,772 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 1,023,473
in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily a result of a gain from realization of contingent sale consideration
receivable related to the collection of consideration in the AHP sale in 2023, offset by higher debt-related interest and discount amortization
charges in 2024 corresponding to higher debt balances with larger initial fees and discounts. 

Loss from continuing operations
increased by 1,811,749, or 1,123 , to 1,973,119 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 161,370 in the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increased loss was due primarily to a 1,075,857 gain from realization of contingent sale consideration
receivable related to the collection of consideration in the AHP sale in the three months ended September 30, 2023, higher impairment
charges and a decrease in patient service revenue in 2024, offset in part by reduced practice operating costs and corporate overhead costs. 

Gain (loss) from operations of discontinued
operations 

As a result of the AHP Sale
on January 17, 2023, our ACO/MSO Division was classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Loss from operations of discontinued operations decreased by 13,554, or 100 ,
from 13,554 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to -0- in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The loss in 2023 reflects
winding down costs of the discontinued operation after the sale on January 17, 2023. No revenue or costs were incurred related to the
business in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net loss 

Net loss increased by 1,798,195,
or 1,028 , to 1,973,119 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 174,924 in the three months ended September 30, 2023,
due primarily to a 1,075,857 gain from realization of contingent sale consideration receivable related to the collection of consideration
in the AHP sale in the three months ended September 30, 2023, higher impairment charges and a decrease in patient service revenue in 2024,
offset in part by reduced practice operating costs and corporate overhead costs.

Revenue 

Patient service revenue decreased
by 2,352,502, or 51 year-over-year, from 4,602,081 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2,249,579 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of (i) a 54 year-over-year decrease at our NCFM practice of 1,929,275 due to changes in clinical
staffing that saw the departure of three physicians in 2023, two of which have been replaced, (ii) a 92 year-over-year decrease at our
AEU practice of 243,251 due to the departure of our primary physician and attrition from the practice, and (iii) a 42 decrease at our
NWC practice facility of 228,274, offset by (iv) 22 increase of 48,299 at our BTG practice. The reduction in revenue was offset in
part by a corresponding designed reduction in practice operating costs as described below in the fluctuation of Practice salaries
and benefits and Other practice operating costs, which declined by a combined 1,666,517 from the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to the same period of 2024. While we plan for patient service revenue to increase in future periods from levels realized
in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we plan to add additional physicians and continue patient marketing and retention efforts,
there is no guarantee that such increases will occur. 

Subscription revenue in the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 5,889, or 11 year-over-year, to 48,161, from 54,050, due primarily to a decrease
in HealthLynked Network paid subscriptions that were paired with NCFM membership contracts. 

Product revenue was 91,694
in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 135,034 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 43,340,
or 32 . Product revenue was earned by the Medical Distribution Division, comprised of the operations of MOD, which decreased due to decreased
marketing efforts and demand for our products at our offered price points. 

Operating Expenses and Costs 

Practice salaries and benefits
decreased by 1,088,259, or 41 , to 1,546,806 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,635,065 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of focused cost reduction efforts at all of our practices starting in mid-2023 and continuing
through mid-2024. 

Other practice operating costs
decreased by 578,258 or 32 , to 1,221,272 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,799,530 in the nine months ended September
30, 2023, primarily as a result of focused cost reduction efforts at all of our practices starting in mid-2023 and continuing through
mid-2024. 

Cost of product revenue was
 86,976 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 20,301, or 19 , compared to 107,277 in the same period of 2023, corresponding
to the decline in product sales for the period compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Selling, general and administrative
costs decreased by 212,402, or 8 , to 2,492,740 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,705,142 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower consulting and other overhead costs in our corporate function resulting from focused
cost cutting efforts ,as well as lower network-related fees. 

Depreciation and amortization
in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 9,248, or 4 , to 254,514 compared to 263,762 in the nine months ended September
30, 2023, primarily as a result of certain fixed asset reaching the end of their depreciable lives during 2023. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined
that triggering events had occurred that required an impairment assessment of the NCFM Medical Database. The triggering events included
(i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2024, including a 65 decline compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023 and a 35 decline compared to the preceding three month period ended June 30, 2024, (ii) substantial operating losses and negative
cash flows generated from the practice during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the first time since its acquisition, and
(iii) substantial downsizing of the practice personnel and overhead. We determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, which
consists of the NCFM practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 716,000
to adjust carrying value of the NCFM Medical Database to its estimated fair value of -0- in the three months ended September 30, 2024.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we determined that triggering events had occurred that required impairment assessments
of goodwill related to our AEU business. The triggering events included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2023, and
(ii) an inability of the business to achieve profitability since its acquisition. We determined that the carrying amount of the reporting
unit, which consists of the AEU practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge in the amount
of 319,958 to adjust carrying value of AEU goodwill to its estimated fair value of -0- in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss from operations increased
by 889,305, or 29 , to 3,298,874 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,039,569 in the nine months ended September
30, 2023, primarily as a result of decreased revenue and increased impairment charges in 2024, offset in part by reduced practice operating
costs and corporate overhead costs. 

Other Income (Expenses) 

Loss on extinguishment of
debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 167,649, compared to a loss of 88,932 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2023 resulted from early repayment of notes payable to our CEO and extension of notes payable to our
CEO and CFO. Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2024 resulted from two maturing notes payable to Dr. Dent refinanced with new convertible
notes payable in the same amount and the extension of the maturity date of three additional notes payable to Dr. Dent. 

50 

Gains from the change in fair
value of debt was 93,244 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to three notes payable to Dr. Michael Dent that were recorded
at fair value following extension of the maturity dates of the notes. These notes are revalued at their fair value at the end of each
period, with the changes recorded as gains or losses from the change in fair value of debt. There were no such gains or losses in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gain from expiration of liability
classified equity instruments was 92,641 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and resulted from the expiration of liability-classified
warrants issued in 2020. There were no such gains or losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Amortization of original issue
and debt discounts on notes payable and convertible notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 801,762, an increase of 477,558,
or 147 , compared to 324,204 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization of discounts arose from original issue discounts
on notes payable, warrants attached to notes payable, and beneficial conversion features in convertible notes payable. The increase was
due to higher notes payable balances and larger equity-based and original issue discounts offered for new notes payable, and therefore
larger corresponding amortizable discount balances, in 2024 compared to 2023. 

Gain from realization of contingent
sale consideration receivable was -0- in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1,090,857, or 100 compared to a gain
of 1,090,857 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain in 2023 resulted from actual proceeds received during the period from
contingent sale consideration related to the sale of AHP in excess of the amount estimated to be received at the time of the sale in January
2023. Receipts during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 1,750,000 gross 1,540,000 net) in Incremental Cash Consideration
and 1,873,993 gross 1,186,231 net) from the 2022 MSSP Consideration. There were no receipts of such consideration during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

Gain from the change in fair
value of contingent acquisition consideration decreased by 6,994, or 76 , to a gain of 2,189 in the nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to a gain of 9,183 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These charges relate to the fourth and final year of the
MOD earnout, which is based on the performance of our Medical Distribution Division in calendar year 2024 and is expected to have no required
payout. 

Interest expense increased
by 30,229, or 44 , to 98,423 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 68,194 in the nine months ended September 30,
2023, due to an increase in interest-bearing notes payable to related parties and third parties during 2024, primarily in the form of
new notes and convertible notes payable to Dr. Dent. 

Total other income (expenses)
increased by 1,683,750, or 237 , to net expense of 972,399 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 711,351
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily a result of a 1,090,857 gain from realization of contingent sale
consideration receivable related to the collection of consideration in the AHP sale in 2023 and higher debt-related interest and discount
amortization charges in 2024 corresponding to higher debt balances with larger initial fees and discounts. 

Loss from continuing operations
increased by 2,573,055, or 111 , to 4,901,273 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,328,218 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increased loss was due primarily to a decrease in revenue, a 1,090,857 gain from realization of contingent
sale consideration receivable related to the collection of consideration in the AHP sale in 2023, higher impairment charges and increased
financing related other expenses, offset in part by reduced practice operating costs and corporate overhead costs. 

Gain (loss) from operations of discontinued
operations 

As a result of the AHP Sale
on January 17, 2023, our ACO/MSO Division was classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Loss from operations of discontinued operations decreased by 72,295, or 100 ,
from 72,295 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to -0- in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The loss in 2023 reflects
winding down costs of the discontinued operation after the sale on January 17, 2023. No revenue or costs were incurred related to the
business in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Effective January 17, 2023,
we completed the AHP Sale, at which time we discontinued the operations of CHM and ceased to have a controlling financial interest in
AHP. In connection with the AHP Sale, as of January 17, 2023, we recognized the fair value of consideration received and receivable from
the AHP Sale, recognized an indemnification liability related to potential claims resulting from the AHP Sale, derecognized the carrying
value of assets and liabilities transferred to the Buyer or otherwise derecognized in connection with in the AHP Sale, and recorded a
gain on sale for the excess of consideration received over carrying value of assets derecognized and liabilities recognized. Accordingly,
we recorded a gain from disposal of AHP in the amount of 2,674,069 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

51 

Net income (loss) 

Net income (loss) decreased
by 5,174,829, or 1,892 , to a net loss of 4,901,273) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 273,556
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of (i) the gain from disposal of AHP in the amount of 2,674,069 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no corresponding gain in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) a decrease in revenue
and increased impairment charges and financing related other expenses, and (iii) a 1,090,857 gain from realization of contingent sale
consideration receivable related to the collection of consideration in the AHP sale in 2023, offset in part by (iv) reduced practice operating
costs and corporate overhead costs. 

Seasonal Nature of Operations 

We do not experience any material
seasonality related to any of our continuing operations. 

Impairment Analysis 

Impairment Reviews 

Long-lived assets (including
amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset groups held for use are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset
group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison
indicates that the asset is not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow model. An impairment
charge is then recorded for any excess carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. 

Goodwill is tested for impairment
on an annual basis and more often if circumstances indicate that an impairment may be necessary. Goodwill impairment is recognized for
any excess carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. Fair value is estimated using the same approach as described
above for long-lived asset testing. 

The significant assumptions
we use in the discounted cash flow models are revenue growth rate, gross profit margins on product sales, operating income margin, and
the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections. Among other inputs, revenue growth rate and operating
income margin are determined by management using historical performance trends, projected performance from existing partnerships, industry
data, relevant changes in the reporting unit s underlying business, and other market trends that may affect the reporting unit.
The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the industry
in which the reporting unit operates. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are subject to significant judgment and uncertainty.
Changes in projected revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, projected operating income margins, or estimated discount rates due to
uncertain market conditions, losses of key physicians in our Health Services reporting unit, changes in technology, or other factors,
could result in one or more of our reporting units with a significant amount of identifiable intangible assets recognizing material impairment
charges, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position. Our historical or projected revenues or cash flows
may not be indicative of actual future results. 

Impairment of NCFM Medical Database 
2024 

During the third quarter of
2024, we determined that triggering events had occurred that required an impairment assessment of the NCFM Medical Database. The triggering
events included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2023, including a 65 decline compared to third quarter of 2023
and a 35 decline compared to the second quarter of 2024, (ii) substantial operating losses and negative cash flows generated from the
practice for the first time since its acquisition, and (iii) substantial downsizing of the practice personnel and overhead. We do not
believe that the levels of revenue and profitability achieved since acquisition of NCFM are reasonably likely to return to the extent
that projected cash flows from the practice can substantiate the carrying value of the NCFM Medical Database. 

An impairment loss is recognized
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting
unit s carrying value over its fair value. We determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, which consists of the NCFM
practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 716,000 to adjust carrying
value of the NCFM Medical Database to its estimated fair value of -0- in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The fair value of the NCFM
reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow approach, which applies a market discount rate to a projected stream of cash
flows, as estimated by management. As such, the fair values of the NCFM reporting unit and goodwill rely on significant unobservable inputs
and assumptions and there is uncertainty in the expected future cash flows used in the impairment review. 

52 

Impairment of AEU Goodwill 2023 

During the third quarter of
2023, we determined that triggering events had occurred that required an impairment assessment of the AEU goodwill. The triggering events
included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2023, and (ii) an inability of the business to achieve profitability since
its acquisition. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amount of impairment
loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit s carrying value over its fair value. We determined that the carrying amount
of the reporting unit, which consists of the AEU practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge
in the amount of 319,958 to adjust carrying value of AEU goodwill to its estimated fair value of -0- in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

The fair value of the AEU
reporting unit was determined using an expected present value approach, which applies a market discount rate to a probability-weighted
stream of cash flows based on multiple scenarios, as estimated by management. As such, the fair values of the AEU reporting unit and
goodwill rely on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions and there is uncertainty in the expected future cash flows used in the
impairment review. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity Condition 

During the second quarter
of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements -
Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update
provided U.S. GAAP guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s
ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. Under this standard, we are required to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating
our ability to continue as a going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after our financial statements were issued (November 14, 2025). 

Management considered our
current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our obligations
due before November 14, 2025 and concluded that, without additional funding, we will not have sufficient funds to meet our obligations
within one year from the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. Without raising additional capital, either via additional
advances made pursuant to the SEPA or from other sources, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
through November 14, 2025. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going
concern. This basis of presentation contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. 

We are subject to a number
of risks, including uncertainty related to product development and generation of revenues and positive cash flow from our Digital Healthcare
Division and a dependence on outside sources of capital. The attainment of profitable operations is dependent on future events, including
obtaining adequate financing to fulfill our growth and operating activities and generating a level of revenues adequate to support our
cost structure. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash balances of 14,958, a working capital deficit of 1,982,113 and an accumulated deficit of 46,934,409. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 4,901,273 and we used cash from operating activities of 2,750,520. We expect to continue
to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next 12 months. 

Significant Liquidity Transactions 

Through September 30, 2024,
we have funded our operations principally through a combination of sales of our common stock, convertible and non-convertible promissory
notes, government issued debt, and related party debt, as described below. 

On July 5, 2022, we entered
into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the SEPA with YA II PN, Ltd. Yorkville ). Pursuant to the SEPA,
we have the right to sell to Yorkville up to 30,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, at our request any time
during the three-year commitment period set forth in the SEPA. Because the purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville for the shares
of common stock sold by us to Yorkville pursuant to the SEPA, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of our common stock during
the applicable pricing period, we cannot reliably predict the actual purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville for those shares,
or the actual gross proceeds we will receive from those sales, if any. During January 2023, we sold 225,000 shares of common stock under
the SEPA, receiving 18,765 in proceeds, all of which was applied to the balance of a then-outstanding promissory note payable to Yorkville.
We have not sold any additional shares under the SEPA since January 2023. 

53 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we issued 16 new convertible notes payable to, and received three undocumented advances from, our CEO, Dr. Michael
Dent, for aggregate net cash proceeds of 2,675,000 and refinanced or extended four existing notes with an aggregate principal of 833,000.
We also issued notes payable to third parties for net cash proceeds of 335,000. We made repayments on related party and third-party notes
of 67,601 and 826,545, respectively. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we sold 5,977,193 shares of common stock to four investors in separate private placement transactions. We received
 405,000 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with the stock sales, we also issued 2,500,000 five-year warrants to purchase shares
of common stock at an exercise price of 0.17 per share and 438,596 five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise
price of 0.16 per share. 

On January 17, 2023, we entered into the AHP Merger Agreement, pursuant
to which the Buyer agreed to buy, and we agreed to sell, AHP. Since the sale date, we have received the following proceeds: (1) 750,000
upon signing of the AHP Merger Agreement, (2) 31,381 in March 2023 for the Stub Period Reimbursement, ad (3) 1,750,000 1,540,000 net
after commissions) in Incremental Cash Consideration during June, July and August for meeting participating physician transfer milestones,
and 1,873,993 gross 1,186,231 net after commissions) in October 2023 from the 2022 MSSP Consideration. We also expect to receive 500,000 325,000 net after payments to participating physicians and commissions) in the fourth quarter of 2024 from the Physician Advance Consideration.
We may receive future proceeds comprised of proceeds from sale of shares of the Buyer if the Buyer completes an initial public offering
by February 1, 2025. 

Without raising additional
capital, whether via additional advances made pursuant to the SEPA, from the sale of equity or debt instruments, from receipt of remaining
contingent consideration related to the sale of the ACO/MSO Division, or from other sources, there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern through November 14, 2025. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of presentation contemplates the recovery of the Company s
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

Plan of operation and future funding requirements 

Our plan of operations is
to profitably operate our Health Services business and continue to invest in our Digital Healthcare business, including our cloud-based
online personal medical information and record archiving system, the HealthLynked Network. 

We are marketing the HealthLynked
Network by targeting large health systems, hospitals and universities. In addition, we are marketing via direct-to-patient marketing,
affiliated marketing campaigns, co-marketing with our Medical Distribution businesses subsidiary MOD, and expanded southeast regional
sales efforts. Our initial sales strategy is utilizing Internet-based marketing to increase penetration to targeted geographical areas.
These campaigns are focused on both physician practices and patient members. We also are leveraging MOD s discounted medical supplies
as an offering to our patient and physician members in the HealthLynked Network. We also intend to utilize physician telesales through
the use of telesales representatives whom we will hire as access to capital allows. If we fail to complete the development of, or successfully
market, the HealthLynked Network, our ability to realize future increases in revenue and operating profits could be impacted, and our
results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected. 

We plan to raise additional
capital to fund our ongoing plan of operation.

The Company is not required
to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management evaluated,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on that evaluation, and in light of the material weaknesses
found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. 

56 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

We are not aware of any such
legal proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or operating results. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The Company is not required
to provide the information required by this item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

Except as previously disclosed
in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in a Form 10-Q or 10-K, or as set forth below, the Company has not sold securities that were not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), during the period covered by this report: 

On September 19, 2024, we
issued to a trust controlled by Dr. Michael Dent ten separate senior secured convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount
of 900,000, each with an interest rate of 12 per annum and maturity dates between January 1, 2025 and March 10, 2025. The convertible
notes payable are convertible at any time at the holder s option into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of
 0.0486 per share, or 18,518,519 shares. In connection with the convertible notes, we also issued to the holder a ten-year warrant to
purchase 9,259,258 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 0.0486. 

The sales of the above securities
were exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as transactions by an issuer
not involving any public offering. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire
the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends
