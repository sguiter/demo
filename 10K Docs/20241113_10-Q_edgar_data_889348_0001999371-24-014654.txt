Favorable/(Unfavorable) Adjustments to Gross Profit 

We review our Estimates at Completion EAC at least quarterly. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract-by-contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, and overhead cost rates, among others. 

Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation s percentage-of-completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis.

Any shares of common stock granted in connection with stock options and stock appreciation rights are counted against the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan as one share for every one share of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such stock option or stock appreciation right awarded.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. The risks are included in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ).

Business Operations

We also have a strong and growing presence in the aerosystems sector of the market, with our production of various reconnaissance pod structures and fuel panel systems. Within the global aerostructure and aerosystem supply chain, we are either a Tier 1 supplier to aircraft original equipment manufacturers OEMs or a Tier 2 subcontractor to major Tier 1 manufacturers. We also are a prime contractor to the United States Department of Defense DOD ), primarily the United States Air Force USAF ).

Recent Developments 

None. 

Backlog 

We produce custom assemblies pursuant to long-term contracts and customer purchase orders. Funded backlog consists of aggregate funded values under such contracts and purchase orders, excluding the portion previously included in operating revenues pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ASC 606 ). Unfunded backlog is the estimated amount of future orders under the expected duration of the programs. Substantially all of our backlog is subject to termination at will and rescheduling, without significant penalty. Funds are often appropriated for programs or contracts on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years. Therefore, our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts. 

Our total backlog as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is shown below.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,742,036 compared to 2,535,065 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 206,971 or 8.2 . The increase was primarily the result of higher personnel related expenses. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 8,231,875 compared to 8,210,603 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 21,272 or 0.3 . 

Interest expense 

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 573,366, compared to 663,857 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 90,491 or 13.6 . The decrease was the result of lower year-over-year interest rates charged on our outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement, combined with a year-over-year decrease in the amount of our outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,793,472, compared to 1,816,408 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 22,936 or 1.3 . 

Income Before Provision for Income Taxes 

Income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 904,267 compared to 507,168 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 397,099 or 78.3 for the reasons noted above. 

Income before provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,863,495 compared to 2,945,595 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 82,100 or 2.8 for the reasons noted above. 

Provision for Income Taxes

The decrease in the provision for income tax is primarily the result of the annualization of the September 30, 2023 tax rate. 

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is 17.1 . The difference between the effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the statutory income tax rate of 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to estimated R D credit, state income taxes and permanent tax differences. 

15 

Provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 535,634 compared to 503,850 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 31,784, or 6.3 . The increase in the provision for income tax is primarily the result of the reduced impact in the rate for the R D benefit. 

The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is 18.7 . The difference between the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the statutory income tax rate of 21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to estimated R D credit, state income taxes and permanent tax differences. 

Net Income and Earnings per Share 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 749,677 compared to 301,364 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 448,313 or 148.8 for the reasons noted above. 

Basic and diluted income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.06 compared to 0.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.04, or 200 . 

Basic and diluted income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was calculated using 12,647,023 and 12,717,128 weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively, as compared to 12,759,971 and 12,793,133 weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,327,861 compared to 2,441,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 113,884 or 4.7 for the reasons noted above. 

Basic income per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.19 was consistent with 0.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted income per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.18 compared to 0.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.01, or 5.3 . 

Basic and diluted income per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was calculated using 12,559,876 and 12,650,340 weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively, as compared to 12,613,899 and 12,647,061 weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General 

At September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 16,312,228 compared to 15,402,381 at December 31, 2023, an increase of 909,847 or 5.9 . The increase was driven primarily by lower contract liabilities and higher accounts receivable, partly offset by lower cash and contract assets, lower inventory and lower prepaid expenses and other current assets. 

Cash Flow 

A large portion of our cash flow is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments. Costs and related earnings for which we do not bill on a progress basis, and which, as a result, we bill upon shipment of products, are components of contract assets on our consolidated balance sheets and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed. These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms. 

Because ASC 606 requires us to use estimates in determining revenue, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period. Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money or take steps to defer cash outflows until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts. 

Some of our programs require us to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units. In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could experience margin degradation, which may be material for costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 

We continuously work to improve our payment terms from our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternate funding sources. 

16 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,708,987 compared to 5,094,794 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 3,385,807 or 66.5 . This decrease was primarily the result of cash flow used in operating activities and repayment of debt. 

Bank Credit Facilities 

On March 24, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the lenders named therein and BankUnited N.A. as Sole Arranger, Agent and Collateral Agent (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement or the BankUnited Facility ). The Credit Agreement originally provided for a revolving credit loan commitment of 30 million (the Revolving Loan and a 10 million term loan Term Loan ). The Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate as defined in the Credit Agreement. 

On February 20, 2024, the Company entered into a Thirteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Thirteenth Amendment ). Under the Thirteenth Amendment, the parties amended the Credit Agreement by (a) extending the maturity date of the Company s existing revolving line of credit to August 31, 2025; and (b) setting the aggregate maximum principal amount of all revolving line of credit loans to 19,800,000 from January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024, 19,080,000 from April 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024, 18,360,000 from July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, 17,640,000 from October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, 16,920,000 from January 1, 2025 through March 31, 2025, 16,200,000 from April 1, 2025 through June 30, 2025 and 15,480,000 from July 1, 2025 onward, and for payments to be made by the Company to comply therewith (if any such payments are necessary), on the first day of each such period. 

On November 13, 2024, the Company entered
into a Fourteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Fourteenth Amendment ). Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the
parties amended the Credit Agreement by: (i) extending the maturity date of the Company s existing revolving line of credit
(the Revolving Credit Loans to August 31, 2026; (ii) reducing the Base Rate Margin (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) from 3.50 to 2.0 ; (iii) resetting the aggregate maximum principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans to 16,890,000
from January 1, 2025 through March 31, 2025, 16,140,000 from April 1, 2025 through June 30, 2025, 15,390,000 from July 1, 2025
through September 30, 2025, 14,640,000 from October 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025, 13,890,000 from January 1, 2026 through
March 31, 2026, 13,140,000 from April 1, 2026 through June 30, 2026, and 12,390,000 from July 1, 2026 onward and for payments to
be made by the Company to comply therewith (if any such payments are necessary), on the first day of each such period; and (iv)
requiring the Company, if it does not deliver to BankUnited, N.A. by December 31, 2025, a commitment letter with banks and terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to the Lenders for refinancing the obligations under the Credit Agreement, to make a payment by
January 31, 2026, equal to 2 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans as of December 31, 2025,
with 50 of such payment applied to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal and the remaining 50 retained by the Lenders as an
amendment fee with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment. 

The Credit Agreement, as amended, requires us to maintain the following financial covenants: (a) minimum debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1.0 for trailing four fiscal quarter periods; (b) maximum leverage ratio of no less than 4.0 to 1.0 for trailing four fiscal quarter periods; (c) minimum net income after taxes as of the end of each fiscal quarter being no less than 1.00; and (d) a minimum adjusted EBITDA at the end of each fiscal quarter of no less than 1.0 million. The additional principal payments, increase in interest and the Amendment Fee provided for in the Eighth Amendment (entered into on October 28, 2021) and Ninth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (entered into on April 12, 2022) are excluded for purposes of calculating compliance with each of the financial covenants. 

The BankUnited Facility is secured by all of the Company s assets. Prior to the Fourteenth Amendment the Revolving Loan bore interest at the Prime Rate + 3.50 . The Prime Rate was 8.0 as of September 30, 2024 and as such, the Company s interest rate on the Revolving Loan was 11.5 as of September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 18,120,000 and 20,040,000 outstanding under the Revolving Loan, respectively. 

There is currently no availability for borrowings under the Revolving Loan and the Company finances its operations from internally generated cash flow. 

Liquidity 

We believe that our existing resources as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. However, our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the timing of new program awards and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our borrowing arrangement to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.

Contractual Obligations 

For information concerning our contractual obligations, see Contractual Obligations under Item 7 of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Form 10-K. 

Inflation 

Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations, although the current inflationary environment in the U.S., and its impact on interest rates, the supply chain, the labor market and general economic conditions, are factors that the Company actively monitors in an attempt to mitigate and manage potential negative impacts on and risks faced by the Company. The majority of the Company s long term contracts with its customers reflect fixed pricing and its long term contracts with its suppliers reflect fixed pricing. When bidding for work, the Company takes inflation risk and supply side pricing risk into account in its proposals. 

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4 Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In connection with this evaluation, management identified a deficiency that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, pertaining to income tax accounting. For more information on this deficiency, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on management s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the aforementioned material weakness pertaining to income tax accounting. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The Company has begun to develop new controls designed to remediate the aforementioned 2023 material weakness pertaining to income tax accounting, which the Company intends to implement during 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we continued to implement the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as follows: (a) we replaced the Company s outside tax accounting and tax return preparer with a new firm (the Tax Accounting Firm (b) we retained the Tax Accounting Firm (i) to prepare the Company s income tax accounting and disclosures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and (ii) to review the income tax accounting and disclosures prepared by the predecessor firm for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 prior to the filing of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024; (c) we updated our financial risk assessment to reflect tax accounting as a high risk area, and (d) we adopted a tax accounting review checklist provided by our Sarbanes-Oxley consulting firm for use by CPI s finance management in reviewing the quarterly and annual work of the Tax Accounting Firm, beginning with the tax accounting for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.
