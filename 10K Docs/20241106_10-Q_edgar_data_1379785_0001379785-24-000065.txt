 Incentive Fee 
 The Incentive Fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on the Company s income (the Income-Based Fee and a portion is based on the Company s capital gains (the Capital Gains Fee ), each as described below: 
 (i) The Income-Based Fee will be determined and paid quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) the aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) in respect of the current calendar quarter and the eleven preceding calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter that commences on or after January 1, 2021, as the case may be (or the appropriate portion thereof in the case of any of the Company s first eleven calendar quarters that commences on or after January 1, 2021) (in either case, the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (y) the Hurdle Amount (as defined below) in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Hurdle Amount will be determined on a quarterly basis, and will be calculated by multiplying annualized) by the aggregate of the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including, without limitation, any accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses accrued during the calendar quarter (including, without limitation, the Base Management Fee, administration expenses and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Income-Based Fee and the Capital Gains Fee). For the avoidance of doubt, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 The calculation of the Income-Based Fee for each quarter is as follows: 
 (A) No Income-Based Fee will be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the Hurdle Amount; 
 (B) of the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the Catch-Up Amount determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying annualized) by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches the Catch-Up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters; and 
 (C) For any quarter in which the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the Catch-Up Amount, the Income-Based Fee shall equal of the amount of the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, as the Hurdle Amount and Catch-Up Amount will have been achieved. 
 Subject to the Incentive Fee Cap described below, the amount of the Income-Based Fee that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the aggregate Income-Based Fee so calculated less the aggregate Income-Based Fees that were paid to the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
 (ii) The Income-Based Fee is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (a) of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) the aggregate Income-Based Fee that was paid to the Adviser in the preceding

 Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

 of such amount, less the cumulative aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years commencing with the calendar year ended on December 31, 2018. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee payable for such year. If this Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a Capital Gains Fee. 
 Under the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement, the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company s portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 Under the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement, the accreted or amortized cost basis of an investment shall mean the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment as reflected in the Company s financial statements.

 Valuation of Investments 
 The Adviser conducts the valuation of the Company s investments, upon which the Company s NAV is primarily based, in accordance with its valuation policy, as well as established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring (at least quarterly) basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC Topic 820 ). The Company s current valuation policy and processes were established by the Adviser and were approved by the Board. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For the Company s portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that the Company might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. The fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. If no market for the security exists or if the Company does not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, there are three levels of valuation inputs, as follows: 
 Level 1 Inputs include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made investments of million in portfolio companies to which it was previously committed to provide such financing. 
 Unsettled Purchases and Sales of Investments 
 Investment transactions are recorded based on the trade date of the transaction. As a result, unsettled purchases and sales are recorded as payables and receivables from unsettled transactions, respectively. While purchases and sales of the Company s syndicated senior secured loans generally settle on a T+7 basis, the settlement period will sometimes extend past the scheduled settlement. In such cases, the Company generally is contractually owed and recognizes interest income equal to the applicable margin spread beginning on the T+7 date. Such income is accrued as interest receivable and is collected upon settlement of the investment transaction. 
 Realized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Portfolio Investments 
 Realized gains or losses are recorded upon the sale or liquidation of investments and are calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or liquidation, if any, and the cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the difference between the fair value of the investments and the cost basis of the investments. 
 Investment Classification 
 In accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Company classifies investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments are investments in those companies that the Company is deemed to Control. Affiliate Investments are investments in those companies that are Affiliated Persons of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act, other than Control Investments. Non-Control / Non-Affiliate Investments are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. Generally, under the 1940 Act, the Company is deemed to control a company in which it has invested if the Company owns more than 25.0 of the voting securities (i.e., securities with the right to elect directors) and/or has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. Generally, under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments that are not otherwise Control Investments are defined as investments in which the Company owns at least 5.0 , up to 25.0 (inclusive), of the voting securities and does not have the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. 
 Cash and Foreign Currencies 
 Cash consists of deposits held at a custodian bank and restricted cash pledged as collateral for certain derivative instruments. Cash is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company places its cash with financial institutions and, at times, cash may exceed insured limits under applicable law. 
 Investment Income 
 Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company writes off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and portfolio companies, respectively, with investments that were on non-accrual. As of September 30, 2024, the portfolio companies on non-accrual included portfolio company purchased as part of the Sierra Merger, purchased as part of the MVC Acquisition and portfolio companies originated by Barings. As of December 31, 2023, the portfolio companies on non-accrual included portfolio company purchased as part of the Sierra Merger, purchased as part of the MVC Acquisition and portfolio companies originated by Barings. 
 Interest income from investments in the equity class of a collateralized loan obligation CLO security (typically subordinated notes) is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets . The Company monitors the

 portfolio company that was current on interest payments and on partial non-accrual status for PIK purposes only. 
 Fee and Other Income 
 Origination, facility, commitment, consent and other advance fees received in connection with loan agreements Loan Origination Fees are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan, any unamortized Loan Origination Fees are recorded as investment income. In the general course of its business, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and covenant waiver fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as investment income when earned. Other income includes royalty income received in connection to revenue participation rights which is recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with revenue participation right agreements and recognized as investment income over the term of the rights.

 and , respectively, of the fair value of the Company s portfolio. Income, consisting of interest, dividends, fees, other investment income and realization of gains or losses on equity interests, can fluctuate dramatically upon repayment of an investment or sale of an equity interest and in any given year can be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of the Company s assets were or will be pledged as collateral for the February 2019 Credit Facility. 
 Financial and Derivative Instruments 
 Pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , certain derivative instruments entered into by the Company are designated as hedging instruments. For all derivative instruments designated as a hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument shall be recorded in the same line item of the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item. The Company s derivative instruments are used to hedge the Company s fixed rate debt, and therefore both the periodic payment and the change in fair value for the effective hedge, if applicable, will be recognized as components of interest expense in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps is based on unadjusted prices from independent pricing services and independent indicative broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. 
 Investments Denominated in Foreign Currencies 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company held investments that were denominated in Canadian dollars, investment that was denominated in Danish kroner, investments that were denominated in Australian dollars, investments that were denominated in New Zealand dollars, investment that was denominated in Norwegian kroner, investments that were denominated in Swiss francs, investments that were denominated in Swedish kronor, investments that were denominated in Euros and investments that were denominated in British pounds sterling. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held investments that were denominated in Canadian dollars, investment that was denominated in Danish kroner, investments that were denominated in Australian dollars, investments that were denominated in New Zealand dollars, investment that was denominated in Norwegian kroner, investments that were denominated in Swiss francs, investments that were denominated in Swedish kronor, investments that were denominated in Euros and investments that were denominated in British pounds sterling. 
 At each balance sheet date, portfolio company investments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period. Purchases and sales of foreign portfolio company investments, and any income from such investments, are translated into United States dollars using the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 
 Although the fair values of foreign portfolio company investments and the fluctuation in such fair values are translated into United States dollars using the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, the Company does not separately report that portion of the change in fair values resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from the change in fair

 million and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded net expenses of million and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. 
 Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns are evaluated to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management has analyzed the Company s tax positions taken, or to be taken, on federal income tax returns for all open tax years (fiscal years 2020-2022), and has concluded that the provision for uncertain tax positions in the Company s financial statements is appropriate. 
 Taxable income generally differs from increase in net assets resulting from operations due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized gains or losses, as unrealized gains or losses are generally not included in taxable income until they are realized. The Company makes certain adjustments to the classification of net assets as a result of permanent book-to-tax differences, which include differences in the book and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, and nondeductible federal taxes or losses among other items. To the extent these differences are permanent, they are charged or credited to additional paid in capital, or total distributable earnings (loss), as appropriate. 
 For federal income tax purposes, the cost of investments owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, net unrealized depreciation on the Company s investments (tax basis) was approximately million, consisting of gross unrealized appreciation, where the fair value of the Company s investments exceeds their tax cost, of approximately million and gross unrealized depreciation, where the tax cost of the Company s investments exceeds their fair value, of approximately million. As of December 31, 2023, net unrealized depreciation on the Company s investments (tax basis) was approximately million, consisting of gross unrealized appreciation, where the fair value of the Company s investments exceeds their tax cost, of approximately million and gross unrealized depreciation, where the tax cost of the Company s investments exceeds their fair value, of approximately million.

 million pertaining to operating losses and tax basis differences related to certain partnership interests. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset of million pertaining to operating losses and tax basis differences related to certain partnership interests. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, given the losses generated by the entity, the deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance of million and million, respectively. The Company concluded that the remaining deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized, though this is not assured, and as such no valuation allowance has been provided on these assets.

 Overview of Our Business 
 We are a Maryland corporation incorporated on October 10, 2006. In August 2018, in connection with the closing of an externalization transaction through which Barings LLC Barings or the Adviser agreed to become our external investment adviser, we entered into an investment advisory agreement and an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with Barings. In connection with the completion of our acquisition of MVC Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on December 23, 2020 (the MVC Acquisition ), we entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement with Barings on December 23, 2020, following approval of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement by our stockholders at our December 23, 2020 special meeting of stockholders. The terms of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement became effective on January 1, 2021. In connection with the completion of our acquisition of Sierra Income Corporation on February 25, 2022 (the Sierra Merger ), we entered into a second amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the Second Amended Barings BDC Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. On June 24, 2023, we entered into the third amended and restated advisory agreement with the Adviser in order to update the term of the agreement to expire on June 24 of each year subject to annual re-approval in accordance with its terms (the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement ). All other terms and provisions of the Second Amended Barings BDC Advisory Agreement between us the Adviser, including with respect to the calculation of the fees payable to the Adviser, remained unchanged under the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement. Under the terms of the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, 
 120 

Barings serves as our investment adviser and administrator and manages our investment portfolio and performs (or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation. 
 An externally-managed business development company BDC generally does not have any employees, and its investment and management functions are provided by an outside investment adviser and administrator under an advisory agreement and administration agreement. Instead of directly compensating employees, we pay Barings for investment management and administrative services pursuant to the terms of an investment advisory agreement and an administration agreement. Under the terms of the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement, the fees paid to Barings for managing our affairs are determined based upon an objective and fixed formula, as compared with the subjective and variable nature of the costs associated with employing management and employees in an internally-managed BDC structure, which include bonuses that cannot be directly tied to Company performance because of restrictions on incentive compensation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). 
 Barings focuses on investing our portfolio primarily in senior secured private debt investments in well-established middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries. Barings existing SEC co-investment exemptive relief under the 1940 Act (as amended, the Exemptive Relief permits us and Barings affiliated private and SEC-registered funds to co-invest in Barings-originated loans, which allows Barings to efficiently implement its senior secured private debt investment strategy for us. 
 Barings employs fundamental credit analysis, and targets investments in businesses with relatively low levels of cyclicality and operating risk. The holding size of each position will generally be dependent upon a number of factors including total facility size, pricing and structure, and the number of other lenders in the facility. Barings has experience managing levered vehicles, both public and private, and will seek to enhance our returns through the use of leverage with a prudent approach that prioritizes capital preservation. Barings believes this strategy and approach offers attractive risk/return with lower volatility given the potential for fewer defaults and greater resilience through market cycles. A significant portion of our investments are expected to be rated below investment grade by rating agencies or, if unrated would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income, primarily from our investments in debt securities, loan origination and other fees and dividend income. Fees generated in connection with our debt investments are recognized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method or, in some cases, recognized as earned. Our senior secured, middle-market, private debt investments generally have terms of between five and seven years. Our senior secured, middle-market, first lien private debt investments generally bear interest between the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (or the applicable currency rate for investments in foreign currencies) plus 475 basis points and SOFR plus 675 basis points per annum. Our subordinated middle-market, private debt investments generally bear interest between SOFR (or the applicable currency rate for investments in foreign currencies) plus 700 basis points and SOFR plus 900 basis points per annum if floating rate, and between 8 and 15 if fixed rate. From time to time, certain of our investments may have a form of interest, referred to as payment-in-kind PIK interest, which is not paid currently but is instead accrued and added to the loan balance and paid at the end of the term. To a lesser extent, we will invest opportunistically in assets such as, without limitation, equity, special situations, structured credit (e.g., private asset-backed securities), syndicated loan opportunities and/or mortgage securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average yield on the principal amount of our outstanding debt investments other than non-accrual debt investments was approximately 10.6 and 10.5 , respectively. The weighted average yield on the principal amount of all of our outstanding debt investments (including non-accrual debt investments) was approximately 10.3 and 10.0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, Barings (in its capacity as our Administrator) performs (or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as Barings, subject to review by the Board, will from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Barings also, on our behalf and subject to the Board s oversight, arranges for the services of, and oversees, custodians, depositories, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents, other stockholder servicing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable.

In addition, Barings believes that it has best-in-class support personnel, including expertise in risk management, legal, accounting, tax, information technology and compliance, among others. We expect to benefit from the support provided by these personnel in our operations. 
 Stockholder Approval of Reduced Asset Coverage Ratio 
 On July 24, 2018, our stockholders voted at a special meeting of stockholders (the 2018 Special Meeting to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150 under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the 2018 Special Meeting, effective July 25, 2018, our applicable asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150 from 200 . As a result, we are permitted under the 1940 Act to incur indebtedness at a level which is more consistent with a portfolio of senior secured debt. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 187.6 . 
 Portfolio Composition 
 The total value of our investment portfolio was 2,416.7 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,488.7 million as of December 31, 2023.

 Portfolio Risk Monitoring 
 The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, rates each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk ratings may not be comparable to ones used by other companies. For additional information regarding the Adviser s portfolio management and investment monitoring, see Item 1. Business Portfolio Management and Investment Monitoring in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our risk assessment is based on the following risk rating categories: 
 
 Risk Rating 1: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing materially above expectations at the time of underwriting and the business trends and/or risk factors are favorable. 
 Risk Rating 2: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing in a manner consistent with expectations at the time of underwriting and the current risk is believed to be similar to that at the time the asset was originated. 
 124 

Risk Rating 3: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing below expectations at the time of underwriting and the investment risk has increased since underwriting. 
 Risk Rating 4: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing materially below expectations at the time of underwriting and the investment risk has increased materially since underwriting. Issuers with a risk rating of 4 are typically in violation of one or more debt covenants. 
 Risk Rating 5: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing substantially below expectations at the time of underwriting and indicates the investment risk has increased substantially since underwriting. Loans with a risk rating of 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full or have a possibility to not be repaid in full, and the fair market value reflects the Adviser s current estimate of recoverable value. 
 
 The following table shows the classification of our investments by risk rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Non-Accrual Assets 
 Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. As of September 30, 2024, we had eight portfolio companies with investments on non-accrual, the aggregate fair value of which was 12.8 million, which comprised 0.5 of the total fair value of our portfolio, and the aggregate cost of which was 43.7 million, which comprised 1.8 of the total cost of our portfolio.

 The change in total investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to increased dividends from portfolio companies and joint venture investments and increased fee and other income, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the amount of our outstanding debt investments decreasing from 2,235.1 million as of September 30, 2023 to 2,107.4 million as of September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, dividends from portfolio companies and joint venture investments were 9.8 million and 30.1 million, respectively, as compared to 8.5 million and 26.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Interest and Other Financing Fees 
 Interest and other financing fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were attributable to borrowings under the February 2019 Credit Facility, the August 2025 Notes, the November Notes, the February Notes, the November 2026 Notes and the February 2029 Notes (each as defined below under Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Interest and other financing fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were attributable to borrowings under the February 2019 Credit Facility, the August 2025 Notes, the November Notes, the February Notes and the November 2026 Notes. 
 The increase in interest and other financing fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributed to the interest and financing fees on the February 2029 Notes, which were issued in February 2024, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on the February 2019 Credit Facility. The weighted average interest rate on the interest rate swap related to the February 2029 Notes was 8.4 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on the February 2019 Credit Facility was 6.5 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.1 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Base Management Fee 
 Under the terms of the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement, we pay Barings a base management fee (the Base Management Fee ), quarterly in arrears on a calendar quarter basis. The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to the quarter for which such fees are being calculated. Base Management Fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro-rated. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement and the fee arrangements thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of Base Management Fees incurred were approximately 8.0 million and 24.5 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount of Base Management Fees incurred were approximately 8.3 million and 24.3 million, respectively. 
 The decrease in the Base Management Fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to the average value of gross assets decreasing from 2,660.8 million as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to September 30, 2023 to 2,574.8 million as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to September 30, 2024. The increase in the Base Management Fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to the average value of gross assets increasing from 2,592.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,615.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Base Management Fee rate was 1.250 . 
 Incentive Fee 
 Under the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement, we pay Barings an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee ). A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on our income (the Income-Based Fee and a portion is based on our capital gains (the Capital Gains Fee ). The Income-Based Fee is determined and paid quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the current calendar quarter and the eleven preceding calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter that commences on or after January 1, 2021, as the case may be (or the appropriate portion thereof in the case of any of our first eleven calendar quarters that commences on or after January 1, 2021) exceeds (y) the hurdle amount as calculated for the same period. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of the Barings BDC Advisory Agreement and the fee arrangements thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of Income-Based Fees incurred were 6.6 million and 15.9 million, respectively, as compared to 4.6 million and 24.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Income-Based Fee is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20 of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) the aggregate Income-Based Fees that were paid to the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 The Incentive Fee for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was limited to the Incentive Fee Cap, however, the Incentive Fee Cap in 2024 was higher than the Incentive Fee Cap in 2023 as a result of an increase in Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return partially offset by a smaller increase in incentive fees paid in the trailing twelve quarters (or portion thereof).

The Incentive Fee for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was limited to the Incentive Fee Cap, however, the Incentive Fee Cap in 2024 was lower than the Incentive Fee Cap in 2023 as a result of an increase in Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return partially offset by a greater increase in incentive fees paid in the trailing twelve quarters (or portion thereof). 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 We entered into the Administration Agreement with Barings in August 2018. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, Barings performs (or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operations. We reimburse Barings for the costs and expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement in an amount to be negotiated and mutually agreed to by us and Barings quarterly in arrears; provided that the agreed-upon quarterly expense amount will not exceed the amount of expenses that would otherwise be reimbursable by us under the Administration Agreement for the applicable quarterly period, and Barings will not be entitled to the recoupment of any amounts in excess of the agreed-upon quarterly expense amount. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Administration Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of administration expenses incurred and invoiced by Barings for expenses was approximately 0.4 million and 1.4 million, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program 
 On February 23, 2023, our Board authorized a 12-month share repurchase program (the Prior Share Repurchase Program ). Under the Prior Share Repurchase Program, we were able to repurchase, during the 12-month period commencing on March 1, 2023, up to 30.0 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below the then-current net asset value NAV per share. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases was determined by us, at our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, our stock price, applicable legal, contractual and regulatory requirements and other factors. The Prior Share Repurchase Program terminated on March 1, 2024. The Prior Share Repurchase Program did not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and we could not assure stockholders that any shares would be repurchased under the Prior Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares pursuant to the Prior Share Repurchase Program. 
 On February 22, 2024, our Board authorized a new 12-month share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ). Under the Share Repurchase Program, we may repurchase, during the 12-month period commencing on March 1, 2024, up to 30.0 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below the then-current NAV per share. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, our stock price, applicable legal, contractual and regulatory requirements and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program is expected to be in effect until March 1, 2025, unless extended or until the aggregate repurchase amount that has been approved by the Board has been expended. The Share Repurchase Program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and we cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program. The Share Repurchase Program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 508,132 shares of common stock in the open market under the Share Repurchase Program at an average price of 9.79 per share, including brokerage commissions. 
 Distributions to Stockholders 
 We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP that provides for reinvestment of dividends on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, when we declare a dividend, stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their dividends automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends. 
 We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and intend to make the required distributions to our stockholders as specified therein. In order to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC and to obtain RIC tax benefits, we must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then we are generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. We have historically met our minimum distribution requirements and continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any level of cash distributions and our ability to make distributions will be limited by the asset coverage requirement and related provisions under the 1940 Act and contained in any applicable indenture or financing agreement and related supplements. In addition, in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we may declare a significant portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion may be as low as 20 of such dividend under published guidance from the Internal Revenue Service) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a stockholder generally would be subject to tax on 100 of the fair market value of the dividend on 
 136 

the date the dividend is received by the stockholder in the same manner as a cash dividend, even though most of the dividend was paid in shares of our common stock. 
 The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require us to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, or ICTI, as defined by the Code. Depending on the level of ICTI and net capital gain, if any, earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such excess. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of the next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI. 
 ICTI generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. We may be required to recognize ICTI in certain circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in ICTI each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in ICTI other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as (i) PIK interest income and (ii) interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our ICTI for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. ICTI also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. 
 Recent Developments 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we made approximately 117.1 million of new commitments, of which 95.8 million closed and funded. The 95.8 million of investments consists of 91.2 million of first lien senior secured debt investments, 0.6 million of second lien senior secured debt investments, 0.5 million of equity investments and a 3.5 million preferred equity co-investment alongside certain affiliates in a portfolio company focused on directly originated, litigation finance loans to mass tort law firms. The weighted average yield of the debt investments was 9.6 . In addition, we funded 12.9 million of previously committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans. 
 On November 5, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement, which amended the February 2019 Credit Facility to, among other things, (a) extend the revolving period from February 21, 2025 to November 5, 2028; (b) extend the stated maturity date from February 21, 2026 to November 5, 2029; (c) adjust the interest rate charged on the February 2019 Credit Facility from an applicable spread of either the term SOFR plus 2.25 (or 2.00 for so long as we maintain an investment grade credit rating) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 for borrowings with an interest period of one month, 0.15 for borrowings with an interest period of three months, or 0.25 for borrowings with an interest period of six months to an applicable spread of 1.875 plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 ; and (d) reduce the total commitments under the facility from 1,065 million to 825 million, of which 100 million has been reallocated from revolving commitments to term loan commitments. 
 On November 6, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly distribution of 0.26 per share payable on December 11, 2024 to holders of record as of December 4, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of our unaudited financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. 
 Valuation of Investments 
 The Adviser conducts the valuation of our investments, upon which our NAV is primarily based, in accordance with its valuation policy, as well as established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of 
 137 

portfolio company investments on a recurring (at least quarterly) basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC Topic 820 ). Our current valuation policy and processes were established by the Adviser and were approved by the Board. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with the Board-approved valuation policies, represented approximately 202 of our total net assets, as compared to approximately 208 of our total net assets as of December 31, 2023. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For our portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. The fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. If no market for the security exists or if we do not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, there are three levels of valuation inputs, as follows: 
 Level 1 Inputs include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2 Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
 Level 3 Inputs include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
 A financial instrument is categorized within the ASC Topic 820 valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, unrealized appreciation and depreciation related to such investments categorized as Level 3 investments within the tables in the notes to our consolidated financial statements may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
 Our investment portfolio includes certain debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other observable inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are generally not available. In such cases, the Adviser determines the fair value of our investments in good faith primarily using Level 3 inputs. In certain cases, quoted prices or other observable inputs exist, and if so, the Adviser assesses the appropriateness of the use of these third-party quotes in determining fair value based on (i) its understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer and (ii) the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company. 
 There is no single approach for determining fair value in good faith, as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment. The recorded fair values of our Level 3 investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. 
 Investment Valuation Process 
 The Board must determine fair value in good faith for any or all of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. The Board has designated the Adviser as valuation designee to perform the fair value determinations relating to the value of these assets. Barings has established a pricing committee that is, subject to the oversight of the Board, responsible for the approval, implementation and oversight of the processes and methodologies that relate to the pricing and valuation of assets we hold. Barings uses independent third-party providers to price the portfolio, but in the event an acceptable price cannot be obtained from an approved external source, Barings will utilize alternative methods in accordance with internal pricing procedures established by Barings pricing committee. 
 At least annually, Barings conducts reviews of the primary pricing vendors to validate that the inputs used in the vendors pricing process are deemed to be market observable. While Barings is not provided access to proprietary models of the vendors, the reviews have included on-site walkthroughs of the pricing process, methodologies and control procedures for each asset class and level for which prices are provided. The review also includes an examination of the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes, credit rating levels and various durations, a process Barings continues to perform annually. In addition, the pricing vendors have an established challenge process in place for all 
 138 

security valuations, which facilitates identification and resolution of prices that fall outside expected ranges. Barings believes that the prices received from the pricing vendors are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (i.e., exit prices). 
 Our money market fund investments are generally valued using Level 1 inputs and our equity investments listed on an exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System are valued using Level 1 inputs, using the last quoted sale price of that day. Our syndicated senior secured loans and structured product investments are generally valued using Level 2 inputs, which are generally valued at the bid quotation obtained from dealers in loans by an independent pricing service. Our middle-market, private debt and equity investments are generally valued using Level 3 inputs. 
 Independent Valuation 
 The fair value of loans and equity investments that are not syndicated or for which market quotations are not readily available, including middle-market loans, are generally submitted to independent providers to perform an independent valuation on those loans and equity investments as of the end of each quarter. Such loans and equity investments are initially held at cost, as that is a reasonable approximation of fair value on the acquisition date, and monitored for material changes that could affect the valuation (for example, changes in interest rates or the credit quality of the borrower). At the quarter end following that of the initial acquisition, such loans and equity investments are generally sent to a valuation provider which will determine the fair value of each investment. The independent valuation providers apply various methods (synthetic rating analysis, discounting cash flows, and re-underwriting analysis) to establish the rate of return a market participant would require (the discount rate as of the valuation date, given market conditions, prevailing lending standards and the perceived credit quality of the issuer. Future expected cash flows for each investment are discounted back to present value using these discount rates in the discounted cash flow analysis. A range of values will be provided by the valuation provider and Barings will determine the point within that range that it will use. If the Barings pricing committee disagrees with the price range provided, it may make a fair value recommendation to Barings that is outside of the range provided by the independent valuation provider and the reasons therefore. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in the stockholders best interests, to request an independent valuation firm to perform an independent valuation on certain investments. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of the investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. 
 Valuation Inputs 
 The Adviser s valuation techniques are based upon both observable and unobservable pricing inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Adviser s market assumptions. The Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. An independent pricing service provider is the preferred source of pricing a loan, however, to the extent the independent pricing service provider price is unavailable or not relevant and reliable, the Adviser will utilize alternative approaches such as broker quotes or manual prices. The Adviser attempts to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The availability of observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the security. 
 Valuation of Investments in Jocassee, Thompson Rivers, Waccamaw River, Sierra JV and MVC Private Equity Fund LP 
 As Jocassee, Thompson Rivers, Waccamaw River, Sierra JV and MVC Private Equity Fund LP (each as defined in Note 3. Investments in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) are investment companies with no readily determinable fair values, the Adviser estimates the fair value of our investments in these entities using the NAV of each company and our ownership percentage as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The cessation of recognition of such interest will negatively impact the reported fair value of the 
 139 

investment. We write off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible. 
 Interest income from investments in the equity class of a collateralized loan obligation CLO security (typically subordinated notes) is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. We monitor the expected cash flows from these investments, including the expected residual payments, and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically. Any difference between the cash distribution received and the amount calculated pursuant to the effective interest method is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of such investments. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity is recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
 We may have to include interest income in our ICTI, including original issue discount income, from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. As a result, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements to maintain our RIC tax treatment, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. Additionally, any loss recognized by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes on previously accrued interest income will be treated as a capital loss. 
 Fee and Other Income 
 Origination, facility, commitment, consent and other advance fees received in connection with the origination of a loan, or Loan Origination Fees, are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan, any unamortized Loan Origination Fees are recorded as investment income. In the general course of our business, we receive certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees, covenant waiver fees and loan amendment fees, and are recorded as investment income when earned. Other income includes royalty income received in connection to revenue participation rights which is recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with revenue participation right agreements and recognized as investment income over the term of the rights. 
 Fee and other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

 Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest Income 
 We currently hold, and expect to hold in the future, some loans in our portfolio that contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to us in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. 
 140 

PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income at the time of recognition, is included in our taxable income and therefore affects the amount we are required to distribute to our stockholders to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we have not yet collected the cash. Generally, when current cash interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing PIK interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. We write off any previously accrued and uncollected PIK interest when it is determined that the PIK interest is no longer collectible. 
 We may have to include in our ICTI, PIK interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. As a result, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. 
 Unused Commitments 
 In the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, consisting primarily of unused commitments to extend financing to our portfolio companies. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. The balances of unused commitments to extend financing as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

 In the normal course of business, we guarantee certain obligations in connection with our portfolio companies (in particular, certain controlled portfolio companies). Under these guarantee arrangements, payments may be required to be made to third parties if such guarantees are called upon or if the portfolio companies were to default on their related obligations, as applicable. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had guaranteed 9.9 million 11.0 million U.S. dollars and 10.9 million U.S. dollars, respectively) relating to credit facilities among Erste Bank and MVC Automotive Group Gmbh, or MVC Auto, that mature in December 2025. We would be required to make payments to Erste Bank if MVC Auto were to default on their related payment obligations. None of the credit facility guarantees are recorded as a liability on our Unaudited and Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, the credit facility liabilities are considered in the valuation of our investments in MVC Auto. The guarantees denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at the relevant balance sheet date. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to market risk. Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The fair value of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies we invest in; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; global pandemics; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate fluctuations. 
 In addition, we are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Our net investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including EURIBOR, BBSY, STIBOR, CORRA, SOFR, SONIA, SARON, NIBOR and BKBM. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. We currently, and may in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, no settings of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR continue to be published. On March 15, 2022, the U.S. enacted federal legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty following U.S. 
 146 

dollar LIBOR s cessation by replacing LIBOR references in certain U.S. law-governed contracts under certain circumstances with a SOFR-based rate identified in a Federal Reserve rule plus a statutory spread adjustment. 
 Our loan agreements with our portfolio companies that referenced LIBOR included fallback language in the event that LIBOR was discontinued, became unrepresentative or in the event that the method for determining LIBOR has changed. As a result of this language or through other bi-lateral amendments, all of these loan agreements have transitioned to an alternative reference rate. 
 The transition away from LIBOR and reform, modification, or adjustments of other reference rate benchmarks to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of any changes in the pricing of our investments, changes to the documentation for certain of our investments and the pace of such changes, disputes and other actions regarding the interpretation of current and prospective loan documentation or modifications to processes and systems. 
 Following a campaign by the U.S. Federal Reserve of raising interest rates to address significant and persistent inflation in order to slow economic growth and reduce price pressure, in September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a benchmark rate cut and has announced that it may cut benchmark rates further in the next year, depending on inflation reports and other metrics. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in SOFR are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over SOFR that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in in our operating expenses, including with respect to our income incentive fee, or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to SOFR. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1,851.8 million (principal amount) of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which generally are SOFR-based (or based on an equivalent applicable currency rate), and many of which are subject to certain floors. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 647.8 million (principal amount) of our borrowings bore interest at variable rates (approximately 47.2 of our total borrowings as of September 30, 2024) under the February 2019 Credit Facility and the February 2029 Notes. See Note 5. Borrowings to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the variable interest rates and spreads applicable to borrowings under the February 2019 Credit Facility and the February 2029 Notes. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments and borrowings (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

 (1) Excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange. 
 (2) Excludes the impact of income based fees. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the income based fees. 
 We may also have exposure to foreign currencies related to certain investments. Such investments are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at the relevant balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. In order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates, we generally borrow in local foreign currencies under the February 2019 Credit Facility to finance such investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had U.S. dollar borrowings of 131.0 million outstanding under the February 2019 Credit Facility with an interest rate of 7.105 (one month SOFR of 5.005 ), borrowings denominated in Swedish kronor of 9.8kr million 1.0 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 5.500 (one month STIBOR of 3.500 ), borrowings denominated in British pounds sterling of 55.6 million 74.6 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 7.233 (one month SONIA of 5.200 and borrowings denominated in Euros of 126.6 million 141.3 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 5.500 (one month EURIBOR of 3.500 ).

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Neither we, the Adviser, nor our subsidiaries are currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our respective businesses. We, the Adviser, and our subsidiaries may from time to time, however, be involved in litigation arising out of operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, including in connection with strategic transactions. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the risks referenced below and all other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our interim financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to transact in our securities. The risks and uncertainties referenced herein are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities. 
 There have been no material changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which you should carefully consider before transacting in our securities. If any of such risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Sales of Unregistered Securities

 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with our DRIP for our common stockholders, we directed the plan administrator to purchase 60,837 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 604,177 in the open market in order to satisfy our obligations to deliver shares of common stock to our stockholders with respect to our dividend declared on August 7, 2024. 
 On February 22, 2024, the Board authorized a new 12-month Share Repurchase Program. Under the Share Repurchase Program, we may repurchase, during the 12-month period commencing on March 1, 2024, up to 30.0 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below the then-current NAV per share. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, our stock price, applicable legal, contractual and regulatory requirements and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program is expected to be in effect until March 1, 2025, unless extended or until the aggregate repurchase amount that has been approved by the Board has been expended. The Share Repurchase Program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and we cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program. The Share Repurchase Program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 199,054 shares of our common stock in the open market under the Share Repurchase Program at an average price of 9.84 per share, including brokerage commissions.

 SECTION 1.05 Currencies Currency Equivalents . 
 (a) Currencies Generally . At any time, any reference in the definition of the 
 term Agreed Foreign Currency or in any other provision of this Agreement to the Currency of 
 any particular nation means the lawful currency of such nation at such time whether or not the 
 name of such Currency is the same as it was on the Effective Date. Except as provided in 
 Section 2.09(b) and the last sentence of Section 2.16(a) , for purposes of determining (i) whether 
 the amount of any Multicurrency Borrowing or Letter of Credit then outstanding or to be 
 borrowed at the same time as such Borrowing would exceed the aggregate amount of 
 Multicurrency Commitments, (ii) the aggregate unutilized amount of the Multicurrency 
 Commitments, (iii) the Multicurrency Credit Exposure, (iv) the LC Exposure, (v) the Covered 
 Debt Amount and (vi) the Borrowing Base or the Value of any Portfolio Investment, the 
 outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit that is denominated in any 
 Foreign Currency or the Value of any Portfolio Investment that is denominated in any Foreign 
 Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the Foreign Currency of 
 such Borrowing, Letter of Credit or Portfolio Investment, as the case may be, determined as of 
 the date of such Borrowing or Letter of Credit (determined in accordance with the last sentence 
 of the definition of the term Interest Period or the date of valuation of such Portfolio 
 Investment, as the case may be provided that in connection with the delivery of any Borrowing 
 Base Certificate pursuant to Section 5.01(d) or (e) , such amounts shall be determined as of the 
 date of delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate. Wherever in this Agreement in connection 
 with a Borrowing or Loan an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is 
 expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing or Loan is denominated in a Foreign Currency, such 
 amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Dollar Amount (rounded to 
 the nearest 1,000 units of such Foreign Currency). Without limiting the generality of the 
 foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with any basket in this Agreement, in no 

56 

event shall any Obligor be deemed to not be in compliance with any such basket solely as a 
 result of a change in exchange rates. 
 (b) Special Provisions Relating to Euro . Each obligation hereunder of any 
 party hereto that is denominated in the National Currency of a state that is not a Participating 
 Member State on the Effective Date shall, effective from the date on which such state becomes a 
 Participating Member State, be redenominated in Euro in accordance with the legislation of the 
 European Union applicable to the European Monetary Union provided that, if and to the extent 
 that any such legislation provides that any such obligation of any such party payable within such 
 Participating Member State by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor 
 either in Euros or such National Currency, such party shall be entitled to pay or repay such 
 amount either in Euros or in such National Currency. If the basis of accrual of interest or fees 
 expressed in this Agreement with respect to an Agreed Foreign Currency of any country that 
 becomes a Participating Member State after the date on which such currency becomes an Agreed 
 Foreign Currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market 
 for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall 
 replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such state becomes a 
 Participating Member State provided that, with respect to any Borrowing denominated in such 
 currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect at 
 the end of the Interest Period therefor. 
 Without prejudice to the liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders and the Lenders 
 to the Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement, each provision of this Agreement shall be 
 subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to 
 time, in consultation with the Borrower, reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to 
 reflect the introduction or changeover to the Euro in any country that becomes a Participating 
 Member State after the Effective Date provided that the Administrative Agent shall provide the 
 Borrower and the Lenders with prior notice of the proposed change with an explanation of such 
 change in sufficient time to permit the Borrower and the Lenders an opportunity to respond to 
 such proposed change. 
 (c) Exchange Rates Currency Equivalents . The Administrative Agent or the 
 Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall determine the Spot Rates as of each Revaluation Date to be 
 used for calculating Dollar Equivalent amounts of Loans, Letters of Credit and Credit Exposure 
 denominated in Agreed Foreign Currencies. Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of such 
 Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between the 
 applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial 
 statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 or calculating financial covenants hereunder or 
 except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) 
 for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by 
 the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable. Wherever in this Agreement in 
 connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Eurocurrency Loan, 
 RFR Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a 
 required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing, 
 Eurocurrency Loan, RFR Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Agreed Foreign 
 Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount 

57 

(rounded to the nearest unit of such Agreed Foreign Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded 
 upward). 
 SECTION 1.06 Outstanding Indebtedness . For the avoidance of doubt, to the 
 extent that any Indebtedness is repaid, redeemed, repurchased, defeased or otherwise retired or 
 discharged, such Indebtedness shall be deemed to be paid off and not to be outstanding for any 
 purpose hereunder to the extent of the amount of such repayment, redemption, repurchase, 
 defeasance, retirement or discharge. 
 SECTION 1.07 Rates Screen Rate Notification . The Administrative Agent 

will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 2.12(d), of any change to the reference 
 rate upon which the interest rate on a Eurocurrency Loan, Term SOFR Loan or RFR Loan is 
 based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and 
 shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter 
 related to the rates in the definition of Term SOFR , Term CORRA , Eurocurrency Rate or , 
 Daily Simple RFR , Daily Compounded CORRA or with respect to any alternative or 
 successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such 
 alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.12(d) , whether 
 upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the 
 implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 
 2.12(d) , including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such 
 alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value 
 or economic equivalence of, the Benchmark being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity 
 as did the Benchmark being replaced prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.

 Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) in 
 exercising such option, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any increased costs 
 to the Borrower resulting therefrom (which obligation of the Lender shall not require it to take, 
 or refrain from taking, actions that it determines would result in increased costs for which it will

 such then-current expiration date) provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may 
 provide (pursuant to customary evergreen provisions) for the renewal thereof for additional 
 one-year periods provided , further , that (x) in no event shall any Letter of Credit have an 
 expiration date that is later than the Revolver Termination Date unless the Borrower (1) Cash 
 Collateralizes such Letter of Credit on or prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to 
 the Revolver Termination Date (by reference to the undrawn face amount of such Letter of 
 Credit) that will remain outstanding as of the close of business on the Revolver Termination Date 
 and (2) pays in full, on or prior to the Revolver Termination Date, all commissions required to be 
 paid with respect to any such Letter of Credit through the then-current expiration date of such 
 Letter of Credit and (y) no Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date after the Maturity Date. 
 (e) Participations . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a 
 Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by the Issuing Bank, and without any further 
 action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each 
 Multicurrency Lender, and each Multicurrency Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a 
 participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the 
 aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Multicurrency Lender 
 acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in 
 respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any 
 circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of 
 Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the 
 Commitments, provided that no Multicurrency Lender shall be required to purchase a 
 participation in a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.04(e) if (x) the conditions set forth in 
 Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at the time such Letter of Credit 
 was issued and (y) the Required Multicurrency Lenders shall have so notified the Issuing Bank in 

62 

writing and shall not have subsequently determined that the circumstances giving rise to such 
 conditions not being satisfied no longer exist. 
 In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Multicurrency Lender 
 hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of 
 the Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of each LC Disbursement 
 made by the Issuing Bank in respect of Letters of Credit promptly upon the request of the Issuing 
 Bank at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is 
 reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be 
 refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, 
 abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same 
 manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and 
 Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Multicurrency 
 Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so 
 received by it from the Multicurrency Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the 
 Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to paragraph (f) , the 
 Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the 
 Multicurrency Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing 
 Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment 
 made by a Multicurrency Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for 
 any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its 
 obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 
 (f) Reimbursement . If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in 
 respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank in respect of such 
 LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC 
 Disbursement not later than 12 00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the 
 Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10 00 a.m., 
 New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower 
 receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, provided that, if such LC 
 Disbursement is not less than 1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to 
 borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be 
 financed with a Term SOFR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing having an Interest Period 
 of one month s duration or an RFR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so 
 financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by 
 the resulting Term SOFR Borrowing or Eurocurrency Borrowing having an Interest Period of 
 one month s duration or an RFR Borrowing, as applicable. 
 If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent 
 shall notify each applicable Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due 
 from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage 
 thereof. 
 (g) Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC 
 Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and 
 irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under 
 any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability 

63 

of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document 
 presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or 
 any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank 
 under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply 
 strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance 
 whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of 
 this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower s obligations hereunder. 
 None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank, or any of their 
 respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection 
 with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank or any payment or 
 failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in 
 the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or 
 delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit 
 (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of 
 technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank 
 provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the 
 Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in 
 respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) 
 suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank s gross negligence or willful 
 misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of 
 Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that 
 (i) the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in 
 substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for 
 further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may 
 make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in 
 substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit 
 (ii) the Issuing Bank shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to 
 accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict 
 compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and 
 (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the 
 Issuing Bank when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a 
 Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to 
 the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the 
 foregoing). 
 (h) Disbursement Procedures . The Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable 
 time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for 
 payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify 
 the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or by email) of 
 such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC 
 Disbursement thereunder provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall 

64 

not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with 
 respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
 (i) Interim Interest . If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, 

then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC 
 Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and 
 including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower 
 reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Term SOFR Loans 
 having an Interest Period of one month s duration (or, if such LC Disbursement is denominated 
 in an Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Pounds Sterling or , Swiss Francs or, following a 
 Benchmark Transition Event with respect to Term CORRA, Canadian Dollars ), the rate per 
 annum then applicable to a Eurocurrency Loan having an Interest Period of one month s duration 
 for the applicable Currency or, if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Pounds Sterling or , 
 Swiss Francs or, following a Benchmark Transition Event with respect to Term CORRA, 
 Canadian Dollars , the rate per annum then applicable to RFR Loans for the applicable Currency) 
 provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two Business 
 Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then the provisions 
 of Section 2.11(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of 
 the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender 
 pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for account of 
 such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
 (j) Replacement of the Issuing Bank . The Issuing Bank may be replaced at 
 any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced 
 Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders 
 of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. In addition to the foregoing, if a Lender becomes, 
 and during the period in which it remains, a Defaulting Lender, and any Default has arisen from 
 a failure of the Borrower to comply with Section 2.17(c) , then the Issuing Bank may, upon prior 
 written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, resign as Issuing Bank, effective at 
 the close of business New York City time on a date specified in such notice (which date may not 
 be less than five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice). On or after the effective date of 
 any such resignation, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may, by written agreement, 
 appoint a successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any 
 such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement under any of the 
 foregoing circumstances shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued 
 for account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.10(b) . From and after the 
 effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights 
 and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of 
 Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be 
 deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all 
 previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Issuing Bank 
 hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all 
 the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of 
 Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters 
 of Credit. 

65 

(k) Cash Collateralization . If the Borrower shall be required or shall elect, as 
 the case may be, to provide cover for LC Exposure pursuant to Section 2.04(d) , Section 2.09(b) , 
 Section 2.17(c)(ii) or the last paragraph of Article VII , the Borrower shall immediately Cash 
 Collateralize such LC Exposure. Such Cash Collateral shall be held by the Administrative Agent 
 in the first instance as collateral for LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter for the 
 payment of the Secured Obligations as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement, and 
 for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for 
 the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in 
 any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property held therein. 
 SECTION 2.05 Funding of Borrowings . 
 (a) Funding by Lenders . Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it 
 hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 
 1 00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently 
 designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make 
 such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like 
 funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing 
 Request provided that Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement 
 as provided in Section 2.04(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. 
 (b) Presumption by the Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative 

Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that 
 such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such 
 Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share 
 available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and, in reliance upon such 
 assumption, the Administrative Agent may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to 
 do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has 
 not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, 
 then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent 
 forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in the corresponding Currency with interest 
 thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower 
 to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such 
 Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, (x) with respect to 
 Eurocurrency Borrowings, the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in 
 such Currency having an Interest Period of one month s duration, (y) with respect to Term SOFR 
 Borrowings, the interest rate applicable to Term SOFR Loans having an Interest Period of one 
 month s duration and (z) with respect to Borrowings denominated in Pounds Sterling or , Swiss 
 Francs or, following a Benchmark Transition Event with respect to Term CORRA, Canadian 
 Dollars , the interest rate applicable to RFR Loans denominated in such Currency, as applicable. 
 If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute 
 such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any 
 Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and shall be without prejudice to 
 any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment 
 to the Administrative Agent. 
 SECTION 2.06 Interest Elections . 

66 

(a) Elections by the Borrower for Borrowings . Subject to Section 2.03(d) , the 
 Loans constituting each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable 
 Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term SOFR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing, 
 shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, subject to 
 Section 2.06(e) , the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different 
 Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Term 
 SOFR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as 
 provided in this Section provided , however that (i) a Borrowing of a Class may only be 
 continued or converted into a Borrowing of the same Class, (ii) a Borrowing denominated in one 
 Currency may not be continued as, or converted into, a Borrowing in a different Currency, (iii) 
 no Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may be continued if, after 
 giving effect thereto, the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate 
 Multicurrency Commitments and (iv) a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign 
 Currency may not be converted into a Borrowing of a different Type. The Borrower may elect 
 different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each 
 such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders of the respective Class holding the 
 Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be 
 considered a separate Borrowing. 
 (b) Notice of Elections . To make an election pursuant to this Section, the 
 Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by delivery of a signed Interest 
 Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent or by telephone (followed 
 promptly, but no later than the close of business on the date of such request, by a signed Interest 
 Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent) by the time that a Borrowing 
 Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of 
 the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each 
 such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable. 
 (c) Content of Interest Election Requests . Each telephonic and written 
 Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with 
 Section 2.02 
 (i) the Borrowing (including the Class) to which such Interest Election 
 Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different 
 portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in 
 which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this 
 paragraph shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing) 
 (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election 
 Request, which shall be a Business Day 
 (iii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, whether the resulting 
 Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term SOFR Borrowing and 
 (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term SOFR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency 
 Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be 

67 

a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period and permitted under 
 Section 2.02(d) . 
 (d) Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders . Promptly following 
 receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable 
 Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
 (e) Failure to Elect Events of Default . If the Borrower fails to deliver a 
 timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term SOFR Borrowing or a 
 Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such 
 Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an 
 Interest Period of one month s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an 
 Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of 
 the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is 
 continuing, (i) any outstanding Term SOFR Borrowing shall, at the end of the applicable Interest 
 Period for such Term SOFR Borrowing be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) no 
 outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing may have an Interest Period of more than one month s 
 duration.

 (a) Scheduled Termination . Unless previously terminated in accordance with 
 the terms of this Agreement, on the Revolver Termination Date the Commitments shall 
 automatically be reduced to an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Loans and 
 LC Exposure of all Lenders outstanding on the Revolver Termination Date and thereafter to an 
 amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Loans and LC Exposure outstanding after 
 giving effect to each payment of principal and each expiration or termination of a Letter of 
 Credit hereunder provided that, for clarity, except as expressly provided for herein (including, 
 without limitation, Section 2.04(e) ), no Lender shall have any obligation to make new Loans or 
 to issue, amend or renew an existing Letter of Credit on or after the Revolver Termination Date, 
 and Loans outstanding on the Revolver Termination Date shall be due and payable on the 
 Maturity Date in accordance with Section 2.08 . 
 (b) Voluntary Termination or Reduction . The Borrower may at any time 
 terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments ratably among each Class provided 
 that (i) each reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) shall be in a 
 minimum amount of at least 1,000,000 (or an amount less than 1,000,000 if the Commitments 
 are being reduced to zero) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments

 Section 2.09 , the total Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Commitments of 
 such Class. 
 (c) Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction . The Borrower shall notify 
 the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under 
 paragraph (b) of this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such 
 termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly 
 following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of 

68 

the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be 
 irrevocable provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments of a Class delivered by the 
 Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in 
 which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent 
 on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. 
 (d) Effect of Termination or Reduction . Any termination or reduction of the 
 Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of a Class shall be made 
 ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class. 
 (e) Increase of the Commitments . 
 (i) Requests for Increase by Borrower . The Borrower shall have the right, at 
 any time after the Effective Date but prior to the Revolver Termination Date, to propose 
 that the Commitments of a Class hereunder be increased (each such proposed increase

 existing Lender (each an Increasing Lender and or each additional lender (each an 
 Assuming Lender that shall have agreed to an additional Commitment and the date on 
 which such increase is to be effective (the Commitment Increase Date ), which date 
 shall be a Business Day at least three Business Days (or such lesser period as the 
 Administrative Agent may reasonably agree) after delivery of such notice and at least 
 thirty (30) days prior to the Revolver Termination Date provided that, subject to the 
 foregoing, each Commitment Increase shall become effective only upon satisfaction of 
 the following conditions 
 (A) the minimum amount of the Commitment of any Assuming 
 Lender, and the minimum amount of the increase of the Commitment of any 
 Increasing Lender, as part of such Commitment Increase shall be 5,000,000 or a 
 larger multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, in such other 
 amounts as agreed by the Administrative Agent) 
 (B) immediately after giving effect to such Commitment Increase, the 
 total Commitments of all of the Lenders hereunder shall not exceed 
 1,500,000,000 
 (C) each Assuming Lender and the Commitment Increase shall be 
 consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (which consent 
 shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)

 (E) the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and 
 the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (other 
 than any representation or warranty already qualified by materiality or Material 
 Adverse Effect, which shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the 

69 

Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such 
 representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific 
 date, as of such specific date). 
 For the avoidance of doubt, no Lender shall be obligated to agree to an increased 
 Commitment requested by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.07(e) . 
 (ii) Effectiveness of Commitment Increase by Borrower . On the Commitment 
 Increase Date for any Commitment Increase, each Assuming Lender, if any, providing a 
 Commitment as part of such Commitment Increase shall become a Lender hereunder as 
 of such Commitment Increase Date with a Commitment in the amount set forth in the 
 agreement referred to in Section 2.07(e)(ii)(y) and the Commitment of each Increasing 
 Lender, if any, increasing its Commitment as part of such Commitment Increase shall be 
 increased as of such Commitment Increase Date to the amount set forth in the agreement 
 referred to in Section 2.07(e)(ii)(y) provided that 
 (x) the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to 12 00 
 p.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date a certificate of a 
 duly authorized officer of the Borrower stating that each of the applicable 
 conditions to such Commitment Increase set forth in the foregoing paragraph 
 (i) has been satisfied and 
 (y) each Assuming Lender and or Increasing Lender providing or 
 increasing a Commitment, respectively, as part of such Commitment Increase 
 shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 12 00 p.m., 
 New York City time on such Commitment Increase Date, an agreement, duly 
 executed by each such Assuming Lender and or Increasing Lender, as applicable, 
 and the Borrower, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the 
 Administrative Agent and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, pursuant 
 to which each such Assuming Lender and or Increasing Lender shall, effective as 
 of such Commitment Increase Date, provide or increase its Commitment of the 
 applicable Class, respectively. 
 Promptly following satisfaction of such conditions, the Administrative Agent shall notify 
 the Lenders (including any Assuming Lenders) thereof and of the occurrence of the 
 Commitment Increase Date by facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system. 
 (iii) Recordation into Register . Upon its receipt of an agreement referred to in 
 clause (ii)(y) above executed by each Assuming Lender and or each Increasing Lender 
 providing or increasing a Commitment, respectively, as part of such Commitment 
 Increase, together with the certificate referred to in clause (ii)(x) above, the 
 Administrative Agent shall, if such agreement referred to in clause (ii)(y) has been 
 completed, (x) accept such agreement, (y) record the information contained therein in the 
 Register and (z) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. 
 (iv) Adjustments of Borrowings upon Effectiveness of Increase . On each 
 Commitment Increase Date, the Borrower shall (A) prepay the outstanding Loans of the 

70 

affected Class (if any) in full, (B) simultaneously borrow new Loans of such Class 
 hereunder in an amount equal to such prepayment provided that with respect to 
 subclauses (A) and (B), (x) the prepayment to, and borrowing from, any existing Lender 
 shall be effected by book entry to the extent that any portion of the amount prepaid to 
 such Lender will be subsequently borrowed from such Lender and (y) the existing 
 Lenders, the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders shall make and receive 
 payments among themselves, in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that, 
 after giving effect thereto, the Loans are held ratably by the Lenders of such Class in 
 accordance with the respective Commitments of such Class of such Lenders (after giving 
 effect to such Commitment Increase) and (C) pay to the Lenders of such Class the 
 amounts, if any, payable under Section 2.14 as a result of any such prepayment. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise consented in writing by the Borrower, 
 no Commitment Increase Date shall occur on any day other than the last day of an 
 Interest Period. Concurrently therewith, the Lenders with Multicurrency Commitments 
 shall be deemed to have adjusted their participation interests in any outstanding Letters of 
 Credit so that such interests are held ratably in accordance with their Multicurrency 
 Commitments as so increased. The Administrative Agent shall amend Schedule 1.01(b) 
 to reflect the aggregate amount of each Lender s Commitments (including Increasing 
 Lenders and Assuming Lenders). Each reference to Schedule 1.01(b) in this Agreement 
 shall be to Schedule 1.01(b) as amended pursuant to this Section. 
 (v) Terms of Loans issued on the Commitment Increase Date . For the 
 avoidance of doubt, the terms and provisions of any new Loans issued by any Assuming 
 Lender or Increasing Lender, and the Commitment Increase of any Assuming Lender or 
 Increasing Lender, shall be identical to terms and provisions of the Loans issued by, and 
 the Commitments of, the Lenders immediately prior to the applicable Commitment 
 Increase Date.

 Loans of such Class (based on the outstanding principal amount of such Loans), in each case first 
 to repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Loans and second to repay or 
 prepay the remaining Borrowings denominated in Dollars of such Loans, if applicable, in the 

71 

order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Period (the Borrowing with the 
 shortest remaining Interest period to be repaid or prepaid first). Subject to Section 2.09 and to 
 the proviso to Section 2.16(c) , if the repayment or prepayment is denominated in Dollars and the 
 Class to be repaid or prepaid is not specified, such repayment or prepayment shall be applied (i) 
 ratably between or among, as applicable, the Dollar denominated Loans of the Multicurrency 
 Lenders (based on the then outstanding principal amounts of such Dollar denominated Loans), in 
 each case (x) first to repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the Multicurrency 
 Lenders, and (y) then second to repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings denominated in 
 Dollars of the Multicurrency Lenders, if applicable, in the order in the order of the remaining

 applicable, the Loans of the Dollar Lenders (based on the then outstanding principal amount of 
 such Loans), in each case (x) first to repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the 
 Dollar Lenders and (y) then second to repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings of the Dollar 
 Lenders, if applicable, in order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the 
 Borrowings with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Subject to Section 
 2.09 and to the proviso Section 2.16(c) , if the repayment or prepayment is denominated in a 
 particular Agreed Foreign Currency, such repayment or prepayment shall be applied ratably 
 between or among, as applicable, any remaining Borrowings denominated in such Agreed 
 Foreign Currency (based on the then outstanding principal amount of such Loans), in each case 
 in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the 
 shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Each payment specified as a payment on 
 account of the Pro-Rata Borrowings shall be applied ratably between the Dollar Loans and the 
 Multicurrency Loans (based on the then outstanding principal amount of such Loans), in each 
 case, if applicable, in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the 
 Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Each payment of a 
 Borrowing of a Class shall be applied ratably to the Loans of such Class included in such 
 Borrowing. 
 (c) Maintenance of Records by Lenders . Each Lender shall maintain in 
 accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such 
 Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of 
 principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

 each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent 
 hereunder for account of the Lenders with respect to each Loan and each Lender s share thereof. 
 (e) Effect of Entries . The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to 
 paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence, absent manifest error, of the 
 existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein provided that the failure of any 
 Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any 

72 

manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of 
 this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any 
 Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the 
 accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

 Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign 
 Currency of such Loan or LC Exposure, determined as of such Quarterly Date or, in the 
 case of a Currency Valuation Notice received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11 00 
 a.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, on such Business Day or, in the case of a

 exceeds 105 of the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Commitments then in effect, 
 the Borrower shall prepay the Multicurrency Loans (and or Cash Collateralize LC 
 Exposure as contemplated by Section 2.04(k) within 15 Business Days following such 
 date of determination in such aggregate amounts as shall be necessary so that after giving 
 effect thereto the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure does not exceed the 
 Multicurrency Commitments. 

73 

For purposes hereof, Currency Valuation Notice means a notice given by the Required 
 Multicurrency Lenders to the Administrative Agent stating that such notice is a Currency 
 Valuation Notice and requesting that the Administrative Agent determine the aggregate 
 Multicurrency Credit Exposure. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to make more 
 than one valuation determination pursuant to Currency Valuation Notices within any rolling 
 three month period. 
 Any prepayment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied first, to the Multicurrency 
 Loans outstanding and second, as cover for LC Exposure. 
 (c) Mandatory Prepayments due to Borrowing Base Deficiency . In the event 
 that (i) the amount of the total Dollar Credit Exposure exceeds the total Dollar Commitments 
 and or (ii) the amount of the total Multicurrency Credit Exposure exceeds the total Multicurrency 
 Commitments (other than as a result of a change in exchange rates pursuant to Section 2.09(b )), 
 the Borrower shall prepay Loans (and or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit as contemplated by 
 Section 2.04(k) in such amounts as shall be necessary so that (x) in the case of clause (i), the 
 amount of total Dollar Credit Exposure does not exceed the total Dollar Commitments and (y) in 
 the case of clause (ii), the amount of total Multicurrency Credit Exposure does not exceed the 
 total Multicurrency Commitments. In the event that at any time any Borrowing Base Deficiency 
 shall exist, promptly (but in no event later than 5 Business Days), the Borrower shall either 
 prepay (x) the Loans (and or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 
 2.04(k) so that the Borrowing Base Deficiency is promptly cured or (y) the Loans and the Other 
 Covered Indebtedness in such amounts as shall be necessary so that such Borrowing Base 
 Deficiency is promptly cured provided , that as among the Loans (and Letters of Credit) on the 
 one hand and the Other Covered Indebtedness on the other hand, such prepayment shall be at 
 least ratable (based on the outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness) as to payments of 
 Loans (and Letters of Credit) in relation to Other Covered Indebtedness) provided , that if within 
 such 5 Business Day period, the Borrower shall present to the Administrative Agent a reasonably 
 feasible plan, which plan is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will enable 
 any such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 Business Days of the occurrence of 
 such Borrowing Base Deficiency (which 30-Business Day period shall include the 5 Business 
 Days permitted for delivery of such plan), then such prepayment or reduction shall be effected in 
 accordance with such plan (subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations as to the 
 allocation of such prepayments set forth above in this Section 2.09(b) ). Notwithstanding the 
 foregoing, the Borrower shall pay interest in accordance with Section 2.11(d) for so long as the 
 Covered Debt Amount exceeds the Borrowing Base during such 30-Business Day period. For 
 clarity, in the event that the Borrowing Base Deficiency is not cured prior to the end of such 5- 
 Business Day period (or, if applicable, such 30-Business Day period), it shall constitute an Event 
 of Default under clause (a) of Article VII . 
 (d) Mandatory Prepayments due to Certain Events Following Availability 
 Period . Subject to Section 2.09(e)

Loans in an amount equal to such Net Asset Sale Proceeds (and the Commitments shall 
 be permanently reduced by such amount) provided , that with respect to Asset Sales of 
 assets that are not Portfolio Investments, the Borrower shall not be required to prepay the 
 Loans unless and until (and to the extent that) the aggregate Net Asset Sale Proceeds 
 relating to all such Asset Sales are greater than 2,000,000. 
 (ii) Returns of Capital . In the event that any Obligor shall receive any Net 
 Return of Capital at any time after the Availability Period, the Borrower shall, no later

 proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions or other similar payments and 
 other reasonable costs, fees, premiums and expenses directly associated therewith, 
 including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses, (and the Commitments 
 shall be permanently reduced by such amount). 
 (iv) Indebtedness . In the event that any Obligor shall receive any Cash 
 proceeds from the issuance of Indebtedness (excluding Hedging Agreements permitted

 by such amount). 
 (e) Mandatory Prepayment of Term SOFR and Eurocurrency Loans . If the 
 Loans to be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09(d)(ii) are Term SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency 
 Loans, the Borrower may defer such prepayment (and permanent Commitment reduction) until 
 the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loans, so long as the Borrower deposits an 
 amount equal to an amount required to be prepaid, no later than the third Business Day following 
 the receipt of such amount, into a segregated collateral account in the name and under the 
 dominion and control (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the Uniform Commercial Code) 
 of the Administrative Agent pending application of such amount to the prepayment of the Loans 
 (and permanent reduction of the Commitments) on the last day of such Interest Period. 
 (f) Payments Following Availability Period or During an Event of Default . 
 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Section 2.08 or this Section 2.09 or otherwise 
 herein, following the end of the Availability Period (with respect to clauses (i) and (ii)) or

 of a prepayment of Dollar Loans and to the extent no Multicurrency Loans are 
 outstanding, provides Cash Collateral as contemplated by Section 2.04(k) for the 
 outstanding Letters of Credit, which prepayment (and Cash Collateral) shall be made on a 
 pro-rata basis (based on the outstanding principal amounts of such Indebtedness) between 
 each outstanding Class of Credit Exposure 
 (ii) any prepayment of Loans in Dollars required to be made in connection 
 with any of the events specified in Section 2.09(d) shall be applied ratably between the 
 Dollar Lenders and the Multicurrency Lenders based on the then outstanding principal 
 amounts of Loans denominated in Dollars provided, that, so long as no Event of Default 
 has occurred and is continuing, each prepayment in an Agreed Foreign Currency 
 (including as a result of the Borrower s receipt of proceeds from a prepayment event in 
 such Agreed Foreign Currency (it being the understanding that any receipt of proceeds in 
 an Agreed Foreign Currency shall first be used to make a payment on account of the 
 Loans denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency)) shall be applied ratably among 
 just the Multicurrency Lenders to prepay the Loans denominated in such Agreed Foreign 
 Currency and, if after such payment, if applicable, or otherwise, the balance of the Loans 
 denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency remaining is zero, then, if there are any 
 remaining proceeds, the Borrower shall prepay (in Dollars) the remaining Loans on a pro 
 rata basis (based on the aggregate outstanding Dollar Equivalent principal amount of such 
 Loans) between each outstanding Class of Loans and 
 (iii) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if 
 an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then any payment or repayment of 
 the Loans shall be made and applied ratably (based on the aggregate Dollar Equivalents 
 of the outstanding principal amounts of such Loans) between Dollar Loans, 
 Multicurrency Loans and Letters of Credit. 
 (g) Notices, Etc . The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in 
 writing or by telephone (followed promptly by written confirmation) of any prepayment

 Agent may reasonably agree with respect to notices given in connection with any of the events 

76 

specified in Section 2.09(d)(ii) . Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the 
 prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in 
 the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such 
 prepayment provided , that, (1) if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a 
 conditional notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments as contemplated by 
 Section 2.07(c) , then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination or 
 reduction is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07(c) and (2) any such notices given in

 Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent 
 shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be 
 applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. In the event the Borrower is

 prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Borrowing or a 
 Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR or the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate

 adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their 
 respective Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period or (B) at any time 
 for an RFR Borrowing, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Currency will not 
 adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their 
 Loans included in such Borrowing for the applicable Currency

 (c) Illegality . Without duplication of any other rights that any Lender has 
 hereunder, if any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental 
 Authority has asserted that it is unlawful for any Lender to make, maintain or fund Loans whose 
 interest is determined by reference to any Benchmark or to determine or charge interest rates 
 based upon any Benchmark, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on 
 the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Agreed 

82 

Foreign Currency in any applicable market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the 
 Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to (x) make RFR 
 Loans in the affected currency or currencies, (y) make or continue Eurocurrency Loans in the 
 affected currency or currencies or, (z) in the case of Term SOFR Loans, to convert ABR Loans 
 to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such 
 Lender making or continuing ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by the 
 Administrative Agent by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base 
 Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such 
 illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term 
 SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the 
 Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination 
 no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x)(A) all applicable Term SOFR Borrowings of 
 such Lender shall automatically convert to ABR Borrowings and (B) all RFR Borrowings and 
 Eurocurrency Borrowings denominated in the affected Agreed Foreign Currency of such Lender 
 shall automatically convert to Dollars based on the Dollar Equivalent at such time and shall be an 
 ABR Borrowing (the interest rate on which ABR Borrowings of such Lender shall, if necessary 
 to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the 
 Term SOFR Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate), (1) with respect to Term SOFR 
 Borrowings or Eurocurrency Borrowings, either (I) on the last day of the Interest Period 
 therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Borrowings or 
 Eurocurrency Borrowings to such day, or (II) immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully 
 continue to maintain such Term SOFR Borrowings or Eurocurrency Borrowings (in which event 
 Borrower shall not be required to pay any yield maintenance, breakage or similar fees) or (2) 
 with respect to RFR Borrowings, on the immediately succeeding Business Day and (y) if such 
 notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the 
 Term SOFR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute 
 the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR 
 component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is 
 no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term 
 SOFR Rate. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the 
 amount so converted. 
 (d) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
 herein or in any other Loan Document 
 (i) Replacing Term SOFR Loans . With respect to Term SOFR Loans, upon 
 the earlier of (x) the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and (y) the Early Opt- 
 in Effective Date, the Benchmark Replacement described under clause (1) thereof will 
 replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in 
 respect of any setting of such Benchmark on such day and all subsequent settings, 
 without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to this 
 Agreement or any other Loan Document. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple 
 SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 (ii) Replacing Other Loans and Future Benchmarks . For Eurocurrency Loans, 
 RFR Loans or Loans utilizing any future Benchmark (including Daily Simple SOFR), on 

83 

the earlier of (x) the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and (y) the date written 
 notice of an Early Opt-in Election is provided to the Lenders by the Administrative 
 Agent, the Benchmark Replacement described under clause (2) thereof will replace the 
 then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in 
 respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5 00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day 
 after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without 
 any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or 
 any other Loan Document, so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such 
 time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders 
 comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Compounded 
 CORRA, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 (iii) At any time that the administrator of the then-current Benchmark has 

permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such Benchmark or such Benchmark has 
 been announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark 
 pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative 
 of the underlying market and economic reality that such Benchmark is intended to 
 measure and that representativeness will not be restored, the Borrower may revoke any 
 request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans to be made, converted 
 or continued that would bear interest by reference to such Benchmark until the 
 Borrower s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent that a Benchmark 
 Replacement has replaced such Benchmark, and, failing that, (x) the Borrower will be 
 deemed to have converted any request for a Term SOFR Borrowing into a request for a 
 Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans, (y) any request by the Borrower for a 
 Eurocurrency Borrowing in an Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars) 
 shall be ineffective or (z) any request by the Borrower for a Eurocurrency Borrowing 
 denominated in Canadian Dollars shall be converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing at for 
 which the Eurocurrency Rate shall be equal to the Canadian Prime Rate. During the 
 period referenced in the foregoing sentence, (a) the component of Alternate Base Rate or 
 Canadian Prime Rate, as applicable, based upon the Benchmark will not be used in any 
 determination of Alternate Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate, as applicable, and (b) if 
 any Loan in any Currency is outstanding, (x) if such Loan is a Term SOFR Loan, then 
 such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the 
 Borrower s election prior to such day (1) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (2) 
 be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan 
 denominated in Dollars on such date, (y) if such Loan is an RFR Loan or a Eurocurrency 
 Loan denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), then 
 such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the 
 Borrower s election prior to such day (1) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (2) 
 be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and (subject to the remainder of this 
 subclause (2)) shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal 
 to the Dollar Equivalent of such Loan) on such day (it being understood and agreed that if 
 the Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12 00 noon, New York City 
 time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such 
 Eurocurrency Loan into an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars) and, in the case of this 

84 

subclause (2), upon any subsequent implementation of a Benchmark Replacement in 
 respect of such Agreed Foreign Currency pursuant to this Section 2.12(d) and with the 
 Borrower s consent (which may be given in its sole discretion), such ABR Loan 
 denominated in Dollars shall then be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall 
 constitute, an RFR Loan or a Eurocurrency Loan, as applicable, denominated in such 
 original Currency (in an amount equal to the Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Loan) 
 on the day of such implementation, giving effect to such Benchmark Replacement in 
 respect of such Foreign Currency or (z) if such Loan is a Eurocurrency Loan 
 denominated in Canadian Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest 
 Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower s election prior to such day (1) be 
 prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (2) be converted by the Administrative Agent to 
 a Eurocurrency Loan where for which the Eurocurrency Rate shall be equal to the 
 Canadian Prime Rate. 
 (iv) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the 

use, implementation or administration of a Benchmark Replacement (or, with respect to 
 Term SOFR , Term CORRA or Daily Simple RFR, at any time), the Administrative Agent 
 will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to 
 time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan 
 Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming 
 Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to 
 this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 (v) Notices Standards for Decisions and Determinations . The Administrative 
 Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (w) any occurrence of a 
 Benchmark Transition Event, or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, (x) the 
 implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (y) the effectiveness of any Benchmark 
 Replacement Conforming Changes and (z) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a 
 Benchmark pursuant to clause (vi) below. Any determination, decision or election that 
 may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of 
 Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12(d) , including any determination with respect to a 
 tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, 
 circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be 
 conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole 
 discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan 
 Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.12(d) . 
 (vi) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . At any time (including in 
 connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (x) if the then-current 
 Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR) then the Administrative Agent may 
 remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is unavailable or non-representative for 
 Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (y) the Administrative 
 Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Benchmark (including 
 Benchmark Replacement) settings if such Benchmark (A) is subsequently displayed on a 
 screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or 

85 

(B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be 
 representative for Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) settings. 
 SECTION 2.13 Increased Costs . 
 (a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, 
 compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with 
 or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve 
 requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate) or the Issuing Bank 
 (ii) subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than Covered Taxes and Excluded 
 Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or 
 its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto or 
 (iii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank any other condition, cost or 
 expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Term SOFR Loans, Eurocurrency 
 Loans or RFR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation 
 therein 
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making or 
 maintaining any Term SOFR Loan, Eurocurrency Loan or RFR Loan (or of maintaining its 
 obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of 
 participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum 
 received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, 
 interest or otherwise), then, upon the request of such Lender or Issuing Bank, the Borrower will 
 pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or 
 amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such 
 additional costs incurred or reduction suffered provided that no Lender will claim from the 
 Borrower the payment of any of the amounts referred to in this paragraph (a) if not generally 
 claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances. 
 (b) Capital and Liquidity Requirements . If any Lender or the Issuing Bank 
 determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have 
 the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s capital or on the 
 capital of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this 
 Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or 
 the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the 
 Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but 
 for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s policies 
 and the policies of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital 
 adequacy or liquidity position), by an amount deemed to be material by such Lender or the 
 Issuing Bank, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, 
 as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such 
 Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company for any 
 such reduction suffered. 

86 

(c) Certificates from Lenders . A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank 
 setting forth (in reasonable detail the basis for and calculation of) the amount or amounts, in 
 Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the 
 case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be promptly delivered to the 
 Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error (it being understood that no Lender shall 
 be required to disclose (i) any confidential or price sensitive information or (ii) any information 
 to the extent prohibited by applicable law). The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing 
 Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days 
 after receipt thereof. 
 (d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the 
 Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of 
 such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation provided that no 
 Obligor shall be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing 
 provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six 
 months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower in writing of 
 any such Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions (except that, if the 
 Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs is retroactive, then the six-month period 
 referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 SECTION 2.14 Break Funding Payments . In the event of (a) the payment of 
 any principal of any Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an 
 Interest Period therefor (including as a result of the occurrence of any Commitment Increase 
 Date or an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan 
 other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, 
 continue or prepay any Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any 
 notice delivered pursuant hereto (including in connection with any Commitment Increase Date 
 and regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.09(g) and is 
 revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower 
 pursuant to Section 2.18(b) of any Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last 
 day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each 
 Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of anticipated 
 profits). In the case of a Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan the loss to any Lender 
 attributable to any such event (excluding, in any event, loss of anticipated profits) shall be 
 deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of 
 (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to 
 the principal amount of such Loan referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 
 2.14 denominated in the Currency of such Loan for the period from the date of such 
 payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest 
 Period for such Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan, as applicable (or, in the case of 
 a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would 
 have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate 
 payable on such deposit were equal to the applicable Benchmark for such Currency for 
 such Interest Period, over 

87 

(ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal 
 amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such 
 period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an Affiliate of such 
 Lender) for deposits denominated in such Currency from other banks in the applicable 
 interbank market or, in the case of any Agreed Foreign Currency, in the relevant market 
 for such Agreed Foreign Currency, in each case at the commencement of such period. 
 Payments under this Section shall be made upon written request of a Lender delivered not later 
 than thirty (30) Business Days following the payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, 
 continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section accompanied by a written 
 certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts that such 
 Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent 
 manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such 
 certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
 SECTION 2.15 Taxes . 
 (a) Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any 
 obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and 
 clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, unless otherwise required by applicable law 
 provided that if any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable 
 Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Taxes from such payments, 
 then (i) the Withholding Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings, (ii) the Withholding 
 Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental 
 Authority in accordance with applicable law and (iii) if such Tax is a Covered Tax, the sum 
 payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and 
 withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable 
 under this Section 2.15 the Administrative Agent, Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may 
 be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or 
 withholdings of Covered Tax been made. 
 (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower . In addition, the Borrower shall 
 pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
 (c) Indemnification by the Borrower . The Borrower shall indemnify the 
 Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank for and, within ten (10) Business Days 
 after written demand therefor, pay the full amount of any Covered Taxes (including Covered 
 Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.15) payable 
 or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and 
 any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether 
 or not such Covered Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant 
 Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to 
 the Borrower by a Lender, by the Issuing Bank or by the Administrative Agent (on its own 
 behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank), shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d) Indemnification by the Lenders . To the extent required by any applicable 
 law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount 

88 

equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.15(a) 
 or (c) , each Lender shall, and does hereby, agree severally to indemnify the Administrative 
 Agent, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, 
 (i) against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses 
 (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) 
 (collectively, Tax Damages incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the 
 Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the 
 Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such 
 Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly 
 executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in 
 circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective) and 
 (ii) Tax Damages attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of 
 Section 9.04 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register. A certificate as to the amount 
 of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be 
 conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set 
 off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any 
 other Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any 
 other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. The 
 agreements in this paragraph shall survive the resignation and or replacement of the 
 Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the 
 termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other 
 obligations. 
 (e) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes 
 by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.15 , the Borrower shall 
 deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such 
 Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment 
 or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. If the 
 Borrower is required by applicable law or this Agreement to pay any U.S. federal withholding 
 Taxes (and the Administrative Agent is not so required) and the Borrower fails to pay any such 
 U.S. federal withholding Taxes that are Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate 
 Governmental Authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or 
 other required documentary evidence on account of such Excluded Taxes, the Borrower shall 
 indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for any incremental Taxes that may 
 become payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of such failure, but only 
 to the extent that such incremental Taxes exceed the amount of Excluded Taxes that would have 
 been borne by the Administrative Agent or a Lender absent such failure. 
 (f) Status of Lenders . 
 (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of 
 withholding Tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan 
 Documents shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or 
 times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed 
 by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent 

89 

as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of 
 withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
 Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably 
 requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup 
 withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the 
 contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of 
 such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(A) or 
 (B) or Section 2.15(g) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment 
 such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material 
 unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial 
 position of such Lender. 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is a U.S. 
 Person, 
 (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and 
 the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a 
 Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the 
 reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed 
 originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. 
 federal backup withholding tax 
 (B) each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the 
 Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the 
 recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender 
 under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable 
 request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but, in any event, only if 
 such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so) whichever of the following is 
 applicable 
 (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an 
 income tax treaty to which the United States is a party duly 
 completed executed originals of Internal Revenue Service 
 Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form 
 W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or any successor form 
 establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. 
 federal withholding Tax (x) with respect to payments of 
 interest under any Loan Document, pursuant to the 
 interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to 
 any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, 
 pursuant to the business profits or other income article 
 of such tax treaty, 
 (2) duly completed executed originals of Internal Revenue 
 Service Form W-8ECI or any successor form certifying that 

90 

the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is 
 effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 
 business in the United States, 
 (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the 
 exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the 
 Code, (x) a certificate, signed under penalties of perjury, to 
 the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (I) a bank 
 within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, 
 (II) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the 
 meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (III) a 
 controlled foreign corporation described in 
 Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed 
 executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form 
 W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, as 
 applicable (or any successor form), certifying that the 
 Foreign Lender is not a U.S. Person, or 
 (4) any other form as prescribed by applicable law as a basis 
 for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United 
 States federal withholding tax duly completed together with 
 such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed 
 by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the 
 withholding or deduction required to be made, including, to 
 the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, 
 duly completed executed originals of Internal Revenue 
 Service Form W-8IMY accompanied by Internal Revenue 
 Service Form W-8ECI, Internal Revenue Service Form 
 W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, as 
 applicable, a certificate substantially similar to the 
 certificate described in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(B)(3)(x) above, 
 Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and or other 
 certification documents from each beneficial owner, as 
 applicable. 
 (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
 so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of 
 copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such 
 Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time 
 thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative 
 Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a 
 basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, 
 duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be 
 prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent 
 to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 

91 

(g) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to 
 U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the 
 applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 
 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and 
 the Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by 
 Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested 
 by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such 
 time or times reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as may be 
 necessary for the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to comply with their obligations under 
 FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under 
 FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from any such payment. Solely for 
 purposes of this clause (g), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the 
 date of this Agreement. 
 Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered under this Agreement 
 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or 
 certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal 
 inability to do so. 
 (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds . If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or 
 the Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a 
 refund of any Covered Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with 
 respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15 , it shall 
 pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity 
 payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to 
 the Covered Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the 
 Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest 
 (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such 
 refund ), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender 
 or the Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower pursuant to this 
 paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant 
 Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank in the 
 event the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund 
 to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), 
 in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank be required to pay any 
 amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the 
 Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank in a less favorable net position after- 
 Taxes than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank would have been in if the 
 Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or 
 otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such 
 Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (h) shall not be construed to require the Administrative 
 Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available its Tax returns or its books or records 
 (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any

 repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document to which the 
 Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

 required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursement of LC 
 Disbursements, or under Section 2.13 , 2.14 or 2.15 , or otherwise) or under any other Loan 
 Document (except to the extent otherwise expressly provided therein) prior to 2 00 p.m., 
 New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off, 
 deduction or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the 
 discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding 
 Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to 
 the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Account, except as otherwise expressly 
 provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments to be made directly to the Issuing 
 Bank as expressly provided herein and pursuant to Sections 2.13 , 2.14 , 2.15 and 9.03 , which 
 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute 
 any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient 
 promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a 
 Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, 
 in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of 
 such extension. 
 All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments 
 required under Sections 2.13 and 2.14 (except to the extent otherwise provided therein relating to 
 any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan 
 denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under 
 Section 2.14 or any reimbursement or cash collateralization of any LC Exposure denominated in 
 any Foreign Currency, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan 
 Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or LC 
 Disbursement when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment 
 or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan or such LC Disbursement shall, if such Loan or 
 such LC Disbursement is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars 
 on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period 
 therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent 
 thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand and if 
 the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement that is not 
 denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due 
 date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, 

93 

on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the 
 date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand. 
 (b) Application of Insufficient Payments . If at any time insufficient funds are 
 received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, 
 unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds 
 shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among 
 the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such 
 parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then 
 due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of 
 principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties. 
 (c) Pro Rata Treatment . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein 
 (i) each Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class, and each 
 termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.07 , 2.09 
 or otherwise shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, pro 
 rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (ii) each 
 Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to 
 the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of 
 Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the 
 case of conversions and continuations of Loans) (iii) each payment of commitment fees under 
 Section 2.10 shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata according to the average daily 
 unutilized amounts of their respective Commitments (iv) each payment or prepayment of 
 principal of Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders or such 
 Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such 
 Class held by them and (v) each payment of interest on Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall 
 be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of 
 interest on such Loans of such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders provided , 
 however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that the 
 Borrower wishes to make a Multicurrency Borrowing in an Agreed Foreign Currency and the 
 Multicurrency Commitments are fully utilized, the Borrower may make a Borrowing under the 
 Dollar Commitments (if otherwise permitted hereunder) and may use the proceeds of such 
 Borrowing to prepay the Multicurrency Loans (without making a ratable prepayment to the 
 Dollar Loans) solely to the extent that the Borrower substantially concurrently therewith utilizes 
 any Multicurrency Commitments made available as a result of such prepayment to make a 
 Multicurrency Borrowing in an Agreed Foreign Currency. 
 (d) Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender of a Class shall, by 
 exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any 
 principal of or interest on any of its Loans, or participations in LC Disbursements of a Class 
 resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its 
 Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, and accrued interest thereon of such Class then 
 due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving 
 such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and 
 participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that 
 the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in 

94 

accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective 
 Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of such Class provided that (i) if any such 
 participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is 
 recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of 
 such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to 
 apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express 
 terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the 
 assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements 
 to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof 
 (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the 
 foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender 
 acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the 
 Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such 
 Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
 (e) Presumptions of Payment . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
 received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the 
 Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the 
 Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower 
 has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such 
 assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. 
 In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders and 
 the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent 
 forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest 
 thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but 
 excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 
 (f) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent . If any Lender shall fail 
 to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(e) , 2.05 or 2.16(e) , then 
 the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), 
 apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to 
 satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are 
 fully paid. 
 SECTION 2.17 Defaulting Lenders . 
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender 
 becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such 
 Lender is a Defaulting Lender 
 (a) commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall cease to accrue on the 
 unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender to the extent, and during the 
 period in which, such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to 
 pay any such commitment fee that otherwise would have accrued and been required to have been 
 paid to such Defaulting Lender to the extent and during the period in which such Lender is a 
 Defaulting Lender) 

95 

(b) the Commitment and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not 
 be included in determining whether all Lenders, two-thirds of the Lenders, two-thirds of the 
 Lenders of a Class, the Required Lenders or the Required Lenders of a Class have taken or may 
 take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any 
 amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02 , except for any amendment or waiver described in 
 Section 9.02(b)(i) , (ii) , (iii or (iv) provided that any waiver, amendment or modification 
 requiring the consent of all Lenders, two-thirds of the Lenders or each affected Lender which 
 affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other Lenders or affected Lenders (as applicable) 
 shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
 (c) if any LC Exposure exists at the time a Multicurrency Lender becomes a 
 Defaulting Lender then 
 (i) all or any part of such LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non- 
 Defaulting Multicurrency Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable 
 Multicurrency Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting 
 Lenders Multicurrency Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure 
 does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Multicurrency Commitments, (y) 
 no non-Defaulting Lender s Multicurrency Credit Exposure will exceed such Lender s 
 Multicurrency Commitment, and (z) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied 
 at such time (and unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent at such time, 
 the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are 
 satisfied at such time) 
 (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only 
 partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy 
 available to it hereunder or under law, within three Business Days following notice by the 
 Administrative Agent, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure (after 
 giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with 
 the procedures set forth in Section 2.04(k) for so long as such LC Exposure is 
 outstanding 
 (iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting 
 Lender s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to 
 pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(b) with respect to such 
 Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender s LC 
 Exposure is cash collateralized 
 (iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant 
 to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.10(a) and 
 Section 2.10(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Multicurrency 
 Lenders Applicable Multicurrency Percentages in effect after giving effect to such 
 reallocation 
 (v) if any Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor 
 reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.17(c) , then, without prejudice to any rights or 

96 

remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise 
 would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of 
 such Defaulting Lender s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter 
 of credit fees payable under Section 2.10(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s LC 
 Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash 
 collateralized and or reallocated and 
 (vi) subject to Section 9.16 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver 
 or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from 
 that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting 
 Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such 
 reallocation. 
 (d) so long as any Multicurrency Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing 
 Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied 
 that the related exposure will be 100 covered by the Multicurrency Commitments of the non- 
 Defaulting Multicurrency Lenders and or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in 
 accordance with Section 2.17(c) , and participating interests in any such newly issued or 
 increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner 
 consistent with Section 2.17(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein). 
 In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower agree in writing that 
 a Defaulting Lender that is a Dollar Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such 
 Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then, on the date of such agreement, such Lender shall 
 purchase at par such of the Loans made to each Borrower of the other Lenders as the 
 Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for the Lenders to hold such 
 Loans in accordance with their Applicable Dollar Percentage in effect immediately after giving 
 effect to such agreement. In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the 
 Issuing Bank each agrees in writing that a Defaulting Lender that is a Multicurrency Lender has 
 adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then, on the 
 date of such agreement, such Lender shall no longer be deemed a Defaulting Lender, the 
 Borrower shall no longer be required to cash collateralize any portion of such Lender s LC 
 Exposure cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.17(c)(ii) above, the LC Exposure of the 
 Multicurrency Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s 
 Multicurrency Commitment and such Lender shall purchase at par the portion of the Loans of the 
 other Multicurrency Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in 
 order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Multicurrency 
 Percentage in effect immediately after giving effect to such agreement. 
 SECTION 2.18 Mitigation Obligations Replacement of Lenders . 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender exercises its 
 rights under Section 2.12(b) or requests compensation under Section 2.13 , or if the Borrower is 
 required to pay any Covered Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental 
 Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 , then such Lender shall use 
 reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate a 

97 

different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and 
 obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if in the sole reasonable 
 judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts 
 payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the 
 circumstance giving rise to such Lender exercising its rights under Section 2.12(b) and (ii) would 
 not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower 
 and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay 
 all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such 
 designation or assignment. 
 (b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender exercises its rights under 
 Section 2.12(b) or requests compensation under Section 2.13 , or if the Borrower is required to 
 pay any Covered Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for 
 account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is 
 unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.18(a) , or if any 
 Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then 
 the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the 
 Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in 
 accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 ), all its interests, rights 
 and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall 
 assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such 
 assignment) provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the 
 Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, 
 conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the 
 outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest 
 thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the 
 extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of 
 all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for 
 compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15 , such 
 assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be 
 required to make any such assignment and delegation if prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by 
 such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment 
 and delegation cease to apply. 
 (c) Defaulting Lenders . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment 
 required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(e) , 2.05 or 9.03(c) , then the Administrative 
 Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any 
 amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank for the account of 
 such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such 
 Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and 
 or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, 
 any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections, in the case of each of clauses 
 (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 
 SECTION 2.19 Maximum Rate . Notwithstanding anything herein to the 
 contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges 

98 

and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, 
 the Charges ), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate which may be 
 contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan, the rate of 
 interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all related Charges, shall be 
 limited to the Maximum Rate. To the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have 
 been payable in respect of a Loan made to the Borrower, but were not payable as a result of the 
 operation of this Section, shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender 
 by the Borrower in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the 
 Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the 
 Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

 are based upon estimates and assumptions believed by the Borrower in good faith to be 
 reasonable at the time made, it being recognized that (i) such projections, financial information 
 and other forward-looking information as they relate to future events are subject to significant 
 uncertainty and contingencies (many of which are beyond the control of the Borrower and that 
 no assurance can be given that such projections will be realized) and therefore are not to be

 Investment is not correlated with the risks of other Eligible Portfolio Investments in an Industry 
 Classification Group, such Eligible Portfolio Investment may be assigned by the Borrower to an 
 Industry Classification Group that is more closely correlated to such Eligible Portfolio 
 Investment. In the absence of adequate correlation, the Borrower shall be permitted to, upon 

119 

notice to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each Lender, create up to three additional 
 industry classification groups for purposes of this Agreement provided that no more than three 
 different additional industry classification groups may be created pursuant to this paragraph (a). 
 (b) Portfolio Valuation Etc . 
 (i) Settlement-Date Basis . For purposes of this Agreement and the other

 not been paid for in full. 
 (ii) Determination of Values . The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value 
 to be assigned to each of its Eligible Portfolio Investments as follows 
 (A) Quoted Investments External Review . With respect to Eligible 
 Portfolio Investments (including Cash Equivalents) traded in an active and orderly 
 market for which market quotations are readily available Quoted Investments ), 
 the Borrower shall, not less frequently than once each calendar week, determine 
 the market value of such Quoted Investments which shall, in each case, be 
 determined in accordance with one of the following methodologies as selected by 
 the Borrower (each such value, an External Quoted Value 
 (w) in the case of public and 144A securities, the 
 average of the most recent bid prices as determined by two Approved 
 Dealers selected by the Borrower, 
 (x) in the case of Bank Loans, the average of the most 
 recent bid prices as determined by two Approved Dealers selected by the 
 Borrower or an Approved Pricing Service which makes reference to at 
 least two Approved Dealers with respect to such Bank Loans, 
 (y) in the case of any Quoted Investment traded on an 
 exchange, the closing price for such Eligible Portfolio Investment most 
 recently posted on such exchange, 
 (z) in the case of any other Quoted Investment, the fair 
 market value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service and 
 (B) Unquoted Investments External Review . With respect to all 
 Portfolio Investments owned by an Obligor for which market quotations are not 
 readily available Unquoted Investments ), the Borrower shall value such 
 Unquoted Investments in a manner consistent with its Valuation Policy, but in any 
 event including the valuation of at least 35 of the Value (to be determined as of 
 the last available Borrowing Base Certificate) of all Unquoted Investments 
 included in the Borrowing Base by an Approved Third-Party Appraiser which 
 shall assist the Directing Body of the Borrower in determining the fair market 

120 

value of such Unquoted Investments, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
 (values determined in accordance with this sub-clause (B) are referred to as 
 Borrower External Unquoted Values ), such assistance each quarter to include 
 providing the Directing Body of the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative 
 Agent) with a written independent valuation report. Each such valuation report 
 shall also include the information required to comply with paragraph (16) of 
 Schedule 1.01(c) . 
 (C) Internal Review . The Borrower shall conduct internal reviews to 
 determine the value of all Eligible Portfolio Investments in accordance with its 
 Valuation Policy at least once each calendar quarter, and shall conduct internal 
 reviews with respect to the Eligible Portfolio Investments at least once each 
 calendar week for the purpose of reviewing and discussing the Borrower s asset 
 portfolio (which shall take into account any events of which the Borrower has 
 knowledge that adversely affect the value of any Eligible Portfolio Investment 
 (other than in an immaterial manner)) (each such value established pursuant to 
 this clause (C), an Internal Value ). 
 (D) Failure of Borrower to Determine Values . If the Borrower shall 
 fail to determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to 
 the requirements (but subject to the exclusions) of the foregoing sub-clauses (A), 
 (B) or (C) then the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of the 
 Borrowing Base as at such date shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of the 
 Borrowing Base. 
 (E) Value of Quoted Investments . Subject to Section 5.12(b)(iii ), the 
 Value of each Quoted Investment for all purposes of this Agreement shall be 
 the lowest of (1) the Internal Value of such Quoted Investment as most recently 
 determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) , (2) the External 
 Quoted Value of such Quoted Investment as most recently determined pursuant to 
 Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A) and (3) if such Quoted Investment is a debt investment, the 
 par or face value of such Quoted Investment. 
 (F) Value of Unquoted Investments . Subject to Section 5.12(b)(iii) , 
 (x) if the Internal Value of any Unquoted Investment as 
 most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to 
 Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) falls below, or within the range of (as applicable), 
 the Applicable External Value of such Unquoted Investment as most 
 recently determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) , then the Value of 
 such Unquoted Investment for all purposes of this Agreement shall be 
 deemed to be the lower of (i) the Internal Value and (ii) if such Unquoted 
 Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of such Unquoted 
 Investment and 
 (y) if the Internal Value of any Unquoted Investment as 
 most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to 

121 

Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) falls above the Applicable External Value (or, as 
 applicable, the range thereof) of such Unquoted Investment as most 
 recently determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) (and the Applicable 
 External Value of such Unquoted Investment is such Borrower External 
 Unquoted Value), then the Value of such Unquoted Investment for all 
 purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the lower of (i) the 
 midpoint of the range of the Borrower External Unquoted Value and (ii) if 
 such Unquoted Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of 
 such Unquoted Investment. 
 except that if an Unquoted Investment is acquired during a fiscal quarter, the 
 Value of such Unquoted Investment shall be deemed to be equal to the lowest 
 of (i) the Internal Value of such Unquoted Investment as determined by the 
 Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) , (ii) the cost of such Unquoted 
 Investment and (iii) if such Unquoted Investment is a debt investment, the par or 
 face value of such Unquoted Investment, until such time as the Borrower External 
 Unquoted Value of such Unquoted Investment is determined (or required to be 
 determined) in accordance with Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) . 
 (G) Actions Upon a Borrowing Base Deficiency . If, based upon such 
 weekly internal review, the Borrower determines that a Borrowing Base 
 Deficiency exists, then the Borrower shall, promptly and in any event within two 
 Business Days as provided in Section 5.01(e) , deliver a Borrowing Base 
 Certificate reflecting the new amount of the Borrowing Base and shall take the 
 actions, and make prepayments (and, to the extent necessary, provide cover for 
 Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.04(k) ), but only to the extent 
 required by Section 2.09(b). 
 (H) Initial Value of Assets . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
 contained herein, from the Effective Date until the date when the valuation reports 
 are required to be delivered under Section 5.01(h) for the quarter ending March 
 31, 2019, the Value of any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base 
 shall be the Value as determined in a manner consistent with this Section 5.12 
 and, with respect to assets acquired before the Effective Date, as delivered to the 
 Administrative Agent on or prior to the Effective Date. 
 (iii) Testing of Values 
 (A) Each February 28, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each 
 calendar year, commencing on April 30, 2019 (or such other dates as are agreed to 
 by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, but in no event less frequently 
 than once per calendar quarter, each a Valuation Testing Date ), the 
 Administrative Agent through an Independent Valuation Provider will value those 
 Portfolio Investments selected by the Administrative Agent and communicated in 
 writing to the Borrower at least ten (10) days prior to the applicable Valuation 
 Testing Date (and which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include Portfolio 
 Investments other than Unquoted Investments) (values assigned pursuant to this 

122 

Section 5.12(b)(iii)(A) , together with values assigned by an Independent 
 Valuation Provider pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(iii)(C) below, the Agent External 
 Values provided that the assets that the Administrative Agent will have the 
 right to value under this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A) will not exceed assets with a Value 
 approximately equal to the Calculation Amount (as defined below). For the 
 avoidance of doubt, Unquoted Investments that are part of the Collateral but not 
 included in the Borrowing Base as of a Valuation Testing Date shall not be 
 subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iii) provided that such Unquoted 
 Investment shall continue to be excluded from the Borrowing Base until such time 
 as the Borrower determines (subject to the other terms and conditions contained 
 herein) to include it in the Borrowing Base. 
 (B) For purposes of this Agreement, the Calculation Amount shall be 
 equal to the greater of (a)(i) 125 of the Adjusted Covered Debt Balance (to be 
 determined as of the last available Borrowing Base Certificate) minus (ii) the sum 
 of the Values of all Quoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (the 
 determination of fair value for such percentage thresholds to be based off of the 
 last determination of value of the Portfolio Investments pursuant to this Section 
 5.12 and (b) 10 of the aggregate Value (or as near thereto as reasonably 
 practicable) of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (to be 
 determined as of the last available Borrowing Base Certificate) provided that in 
 no event shall more than 25 (or, if clause (b) applies, 10 or as near thereto as 
 reasonably practicable) of the aggregate Value of the Unquoted Investments in the 
 Borrowing Base (to be determined as of the last available Borrowing Base 
 Certificate) be tested by the Independent Valuation Provider on any Valuation 
 Testing Date. 
 (C) Supplemental Testing of Values Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
 the Administrative Agent, individually or at the request of the Required Lenders, 
 shall at any time have the right, solely for purposes of the Borrowing Base, to 
 request in its reasonable discretion any Portfolio Investment included in the 
 Borrowing Base with a value assigned by the Borrower (other than Portfolio 
 Investments with Agent External Values as of the most recent Valuation Testing 
 Date) to be independently valued by an Independent Valuation Provider for 
 purposes of the Borrowing Base. There shall be no limit on the number of such 
 appraisals requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion and, 
 subject to Section 5.12(b)(iv)(C) below, the costs of any such valuation shall be at 
 the expense of the Borrower. 
 (D) Value Dispute Resolution If the difference in the Value of any 
 Portfolio Investment determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) 
 and any Agent External Value is (1) less than or equal to 5 of the Value thereof, 
 then the Borrower s Value shall be used, (2) greater than 5 and less than or 
 equal to 20 of the Value thereof, then the Value of such Portfolio Investment 
 shall be the average of the Value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 
 5.12(b)(ii) and the Agent External Value and (3) greater than 20 of the Value 

123 

thereof, then either (i) the Value shall be the lesser of the two Values or (ii) if the 
 Borrower so elects, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall retain (at the 
 Borrower s sole cost and expense) an additional Approved Third-Party Appraiser 
 and the Value of such Portfolio Investment shall be the average of the three 
 valuations (with the lesser of the Agent External Value and the value determined 
 by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) to be used until the third Value is 
 obtained). For purposes of this Section 5.12(b)(iii)(C) , if the Agent External 
 Value is a range, then the Value shall be deemed the midpoint of the range. 
 (E) Failure of Administrative Agent to Determine Values . If the 
 Administrative Agent shall fail to determine the value, at any date pursuant to this 
 Section 5.12(b)(iii) , of any Eligible Portfolio Investment identified to the 
 Borrower in advance of such date as a result of any action, inaction or lack of 
 cooperation of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, then the Value of such 
 Eligible Portfolio Investment shall be deemed to be zero. If the Administrative 
 Agent shall fail to determine the value, at any date pursuant to this Section 
 5.12(b)(iii) , of any Eligible Portfolio Investment identified to the Borrower in 
 advance of such date for any other reason, then the Value of such Eligible 
 Portfolio Investment shall be the lower of the Internal Value and, if such 
 Unquoted Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of such Eligible 
 Portfolio Investment provided , however that if a Borrower Eternal Unquoted 
 Value has been obtained with respect to such asset for the quarterly period 
 immediately preceding the current quarterly period, then the Value of such 
 Eligible Portfolio will be determined as provided in Section 5.2(b)(ii)(F) above. 
 (iv) Generally Applicable Valuation Provisions 
 (A) The Value of any Portfolio Investment for which the Independent 
 Valuation Provider s value is used shall be the midpoint of the range (if any) 
 determined by the Independent Valuation Provider. The Independent Valuation 
 Provider shall apply a recognized valuation methodology that is commonly 
 accepted in the Borrower s industry for valuing Portfolio Investments of the type 
 being valued and held by the Obligors. Other procedures relating to the valuation 
 will be reasonably agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. 
 (B) All valuations shall be on a Settlement-Date Basis. For the 
 avoidance of doubt, the value of any Portfolio Investments determined in 
 accordance with any provision of this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such 
 Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such 
 Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined in good faith in accordance with 
 this Section 5.12 . 
 (C) Subject to the last sentence of Section 9.03(a) , the reasonable and 
 documented out-of-pocket costs of any valuation reasonably incurred by the 
 Administrative Agent under this Section 5.12 shall be at the expense of the 
 Borrower provided that the Borrower s obligation to reimburse valuation costs 

124 

incurred by the Administrative Agent under Section 5.12(b)(iii)(C) shall under no 
 circumstances be in excess of the IVP Supplemental Cap. 
 (D) The values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider 
 shall be deemed to be Information hereunder and subject to Section 9.13 hereof. 
 (E) The Administrative Agent shall provide a copy of the final results 
 of any valuation received by the Administrative Agent and performed by the 
 Independent Valuation Provider or an Approved Third-Party Appraiser to any 
 Lender within ten (10) Business Days after such Lender s request, except to the 
 extent that such recipient has not executed and delivered a non-reliance letter, 
 confidentiality agreement or similar agreement requested or required by such 
 Independent Valuation Provider or Approved Third-Party Appraiser, as 
 applicable. 
 (F) The foregoing valuation procedures shall only be required to be 
 used for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base and related concepts and 
 shall not be required to be utilized by the Borrower for any other purpose, 
 including, without limitation, the delivery of financial statements or valuations 
 required under ASC820 or the Investment Company Act. 
 (G) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt 
 of the written final results of any such test within ten (10) Business Days after its 
 receipt thereof and shall provide a copy of such results and the related report to 
 the Borrower within ten (10) Business Days after the Borrower s request. 
 (c) Investment Company Diversification Requirements . The Borrower 
 (together with its Subsidiaries to the extent required by the Investment Company Act) will at all 
 times comply in all material respects with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements 
 set forth in the Investment Company Act applicable to business development companies. The 
 Borrower will at all times, subject to applicable grace periods set forth in the Code, comply with 
 the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Code applicable to RICs. 
 (d) Alpine Participation Interests . The Value attributable to any Alpine 
 Participation Interest shall be the Value determined with respect to the underlying portfolio 
 investment related to such Alpine Participation Interest in accordance with this Section 5.12 , 
 provided that (x) any participation interest that does not satisfy the definition of Alpine 
 Participation Interest shall be zero and (y) the Value of any Alpine Participation Interest from 
 and after the date that is 90 days after Amendment No. 3 Effective Date (or such longer period of 
 time as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) shall be zero, in each case for purposes of this 
 Agreement. 
 SECTION 5.13 Calculation of Borrowing Base . For purposes of this 
 Agreement, the Borrowing Base shall be determined, as at any date of determination, as the 
 sum of the products obtained by multiplying (x) the Value of each Eligible Portfolio Investment 
 (excluding any cash held by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(k) by (y) the 
 applicable Advance Rate provided that 

125 

(a) the Advance Rate applicable to the aggregate Value of all Eligible 
 Portfolio Investments in their entirety shall be 0 at any time when the Borrowing Base is 
 composed entirely of Eligible Portfolio Investments issued by fewer than 20 different issuers 
 (b) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the 
 Eligible Portfolio Investments issued by all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or 
 other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding (i) 5 of the aggregate Value of all Eligible 
 Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base (for the avoidance of doubt, the 
 calculation of fair value for purposes of this subclause shall be made without taking into account 
 any Advance Rate) (the Total Eligible Portfolio ), shall be 50 of the otherwise applicable 
 Advance Rate and (ii) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate fair value of 
 Eligible Portfolio Investments of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other 
 entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 7.5 of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0 
 (c) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the Total Eligible Portfolio 
 issued by Portfolio Companies in the same Industry Classification Group that exceeds (x) 20 of 
 the Total Eligible Portfolio for each of the Two Largest Industry Classification Groups, and (y) 
 15 of the Total Eligible Portfolio for any other industry sector, shall be 0 
 (d) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of 
 Portfolio Investments that are not Cash, Cash Equivalents, Long-Term U.S. Government 
 Securities or Performing First Lien Bank Loans that exceeds 30 of the Total Eligible Portfolio 
 shall be 0 
 (e) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of 
 Portfolio Investments that are Performing Mezzanine Investments, Performing High Yield 
 Securities, Performing PIK Obligations and Performing DIP Loans that exceeds 20 of the Total 
 Eligible Portfolio shall be 0 
 (f) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of 
 Portfolio Investments that are Performing PIK Obligations that exceeds 5 of the Total Eligible 
 Portfolio shall be 0 
 (g) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of 
 Portfolio Investments that are Performing DIP Loans that exceeds 10 of the Total Eligible 
 Portfolio shall be 0 and 
 (h) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of 
 Portfolio Investments that are Performing Covenant-Lite Loans (excluding, for clarity, Broadly 
 Syndicated Loans) that exceeds 10 of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0 . 
 For all purposes of this Section 5.13 , (A) all issuers of Eligible Portfolio 
 Investments that are Affiliates of one another shall be treated as a single issuer (unless such 
 issuers are Affiliates of one another solely because they are under the common Control of the 
 same private equity sponsor or similar sponsor) and (B) to the extent the Total Eligible Portfolio 
 is required to be reduced to comply with this Section 5.13 , the Borrower shall be permitted to 
 choose the Eligible Portfolio Investments to be so removed to effect such reduction. For the 

126 

avoidance of doubt, no Portfolio Investment shall be an Eligible Portfolio Investment unless, 
 among the other requirements set forth in this Agreement, (i) such Investment is subject only to 
 Eligible Liens, (ii) such Investment is Transferable and (iii) such Investment meets all of the 
 other criteria set forth on Schedule 1.01(c) hereto. In addition, as used herein, the following 
 terms have the following meanings 
 Advance Rate means, as to any Eligible Portfolio Investment and subject to 
 adjustment as provided above, the following percentages with respect to such Eligible Portfolio 
 Investment

provided , that at any time the Consolidated Asset Coverage Ratio is less than 167 (as reported 
 in the most recently delivered monthly Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 5.01(d) ), 
 every Advance Rate in the table above that is below the line for Performing First Lien Middle 
 Market Loans shall be five percentage points less than the applicable rate indicated in the table. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the categories above are intended to be indicative of the traditional 
 investment types. All determinations of whether a particular Portfolio Investment belongs to one 
 category or another shall be made by the Borrower on a consistent basis with the foregoing. For 
 example, a secured bank loan solely at a holding company, the only assets of which are the 
 shares of an operating company, may constitute Mezzanine Investments, but would not 
 ordinarily constitute a First Lien Bank Loan. 

127 

Bank Loans means debt obligations (including, without limitation, term loans,

 Loan) that does not require the Portfolio Company thereunder to comply with at least one 
 financial maintenance covenant (including, without limitation, any covenant relating to a 
 borrowing base, asset valuation or similar asset-based requirement), in each case, regardless of 
 whether compliance with one or more incurrence covenants is otherwise required by such Bank 
 Loan. 
 Defaulted Obligation means any Investment in Indebtedness (a) as to which, (x)

 similar transaction (i) no portion of the DIP Loan is payable in consideration other than cash 
 and (j) no portion of the DIP Loan has been credit bid under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy

 order authorizing the Debtor to obtain credit has lapsed and no such motion or notice has been 
 filed with the applicable bankruptcy court or federal district court or the clerk thereof. 
 EBITDA means the consolidated net income of the applicable Person 
 (excluding extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring gains and extraordinary losses (to the extent 
 excluded in the definition of EBITDA , adjusted EBITDA, adjusted consolidated EBITDA or

 situated borrowers at the time such relevant agreements are entered into as reasonably 
 determined in good faith by the Borrower.

 Agreement.

 1.01 of this Agreement. 
 First Lien Bank Loan means a Bank Loan that is entitled to the benefit of a first 
 lien and first priority perfected security interest on all or substantially all of the assets of the 
 respective borrower and guarantors obligated in respect thereof, and which has the most senior 
 pre-petition priority in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation 
 proceedings provided, however, that, in the case of accounts receivable and inventory (and the 
 proceeds thereof), such lien and security interest may be second in priority to a Permitted Prior 
 Working Capital Lien and further provided that any portion of such a Bank Loan (other than a 
 Broadly Syndicated Loan) which has a total debt to EBITDA ratio above 4.50 to 1.00 will, in 
 each case, have the advance rates of a Second Lien Bank Loan applied to such portion and such 
 portion of such Bank Loan which has a total debt to EBITDA ratio above 6.00 to 1.00 will, in

 of a first lien and first priority perfected security interest on all or substantially all of the assets of 
 the respective borrower and guarantors obligated in respect thereof (subject to customary 
 exceptions), and which has the most senior pre-petition priority in any bankruptcy,

 by the applicable credit facility documents) 
 (b) the ratio of (x) the amount of the first out tranche to (y) EBITDA of the 
 underlying obligor does not at any time exceed 2.25 to 1.00

 required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which is 
 not a Disqualified Lender. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders 
 and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent

 nonetheless become effective except that in the case of any collateral security held by the

 Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be 
 taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

 independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and

 Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished 
 hereunder or thereunder.

 provided in Section 9.02(b) or 9.02(c) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent 
 may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any 
 modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents provided that, without the 
 prior consent of each Lender, the Administrative Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in

 security, or alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the benefits of the Liens 
 created under the Security Documents with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral, 
 except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, 
 to release any Lien covering property that is the subject of either (x) a disposition of property

 prepared by any Obligor in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent or the 
 Collateral Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any 
 failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. 
 SECTION 8.12 Credit Bidding . The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably 
 authorize the Collateral Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any 
 portion of the Secured Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in 
 satisfaction of some or all of the Secured Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or 
 otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition 
 vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the 
 provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the 
 Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which an Obligor is subject, or 
 (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with 
 the consent or at the direction of) the Collateral Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) 
 in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the 
 Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid 
 by the Collateral Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Secured 
 Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the 
 acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount 
 proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the 
 contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt 
 instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such 
 purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Collateral Agent shall be authorized to form 
 one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition 

154 

vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties ratable interests in the Secured Obligations 
 which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be 
 assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Collateral 
 Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition 
 vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Collateral Agent with respect to such 
 acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, 
 shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, 
 control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this 
 Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the 
 case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the 
 limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) 
 the Collateral Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue 
 to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Secured Obligations which 
 were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership, limited partnership interests or 
 membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and or debt instruments issued by such 
 acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any 
 further action, and (v) to the extent that Secured Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition 
 vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher 
 or better, because the amount of Secured Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds 
 the amount of Secured Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such 
 Secured Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their 
 original interest in such Secured Obligations and the equity interests and or debt instruments 
 issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Secured Obligations shall automatically be 
 cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further 
 action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Secured Obligations of each Secured Party 
 are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each 
 Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured 
 Party (and or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt 
 instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in 
 connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any 
 credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

 such assumption, make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient on such date. If and

 Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry 
 rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by 
 applicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent,

 claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Payments received, 
 including without limitation any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender under this Section 8.13(b) shall be 
 conclusive, absent manifest error.

 Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a 
 different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative

 Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance 
 with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. 
 (iii) The Borrower hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment

 Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power 
 hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such 
 right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, 
 preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The 
 rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are 
 cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No 
 waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower 
 therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of 
 this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and 
 for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of 
 a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or 
 Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing 
 Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time. 
 (b) Amendments to this Agreement . Except as set forth in the definition of 
 Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness and Unsecured Longer-Term Indebtedness as in effect on the 
 date hereof, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or 
 modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower 
 and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of 
 the Required Lenders provided that, subject to Section 2.17(b) , no such agreement shall 
 (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of 
 such Lender, 
 (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce 
 the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written 
 consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, 
 (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any 
 Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees or other amounts payable 
 to a Lender hereunder, or reduce the amount or waive or excuse any such payment, or 
 postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written 
 consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, 
 (iv) change Section 2.16(b) , (c) or (d) or Section 2.09(f) (or other sections 
 referred to therein to the extent relating to pro rata payments) in a manner that would alter

 required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, 
 (v) change any of the provisions of this Section, the definition of the term

 hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, 
 (vii) amend the definition of Applicable Percentage , Applicable Dollar 
 Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage without the written consent of 
 each Lender directly affected thereby,

 obligations under any Loan Document without the consent of each Lender or 
 (ix) (x) contractually subordinate all or any of the Revolving Credit Agreement 
 Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) in right of payment to 
 any other Indebtedness of the Obligors or (y) contractually subordinate the Liens securing 
 the Revolving Credit Agreement Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and Security 
 Agreement) on any material portion of the Collateral to Liens securing any Indebtedness 
 of the Obligors, in each case of clauses (x) and (y) above, without the consent of each 
 Lender 
 provided further that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or 
 duties of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written 
 consent of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and (y) the consent 
 of Lenders holding not less than two-thirds of the total Credit Exposures and unused 
 Commitments will be required for (A) any change adverse to the Lenders affecting the 
 provisions of this Agreement relating to the Borrowing Base (including the definitions used 
 therein), and (B) any release of any material portion of the Collateral other than for fair value or 
 as otherwise permitted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. 
 For purposes of this Section, the scheduled date of payment of any amount shall 
 refer to the date of payment of such amount specified in this Agreement, and shall not refer to a 
 date or other event specified for the mandatory or optional prepayment of such amount. In 
 addition, whenever a waiver, amendment or modification requires the consent of a Lender 
 affected thereby, such waiver, amendment or modification shall, upon consent of such Lender, 
 become effective as to such Lender whether or not it becomes effective as to any other Lender, 

162 

so long as the Required Lenders consent to such waiver, amendment or modification as provided 
 above. 
 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no waiver or 
 modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that could 
 reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Lenders of any Class in a manner that does not 
 affect all Classes equally shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class unless the Required 
 Lenders of such Class shall have concurred with such waiver, amendment or modification as 
 provided above provided , however , in no other circumstances shall the concurrence of the 
 Required Lenders of a particular Class be required for any waiver, amendment or modification of 
 any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 (c) Amendments to Security Documents . No Security Document nor any 
 provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified, except to the extent otherwise expressly 
 contemplated by the Guarantee and Security Agreement, and the Liens granted under the 
 Guarantee and Security Agreement may not be spread to secure any additional obligations 
 (including any increase in Loans hereunder, but excluding (i) any such increase pursuant to a 
 Commitment Increase under Section 2.07(e) and (ii) any Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness 
 permitted hereunder) except to the extent otherwise expressly contemplated by the Guarantee 
 and Security Agreement and except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered 
 into by the Borrower, and by the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders 
 provided that, subject to Section 2.17(b) , (i) without the written consent of the holders of not less 
 than two-thirds of the total Credit Exposures and unused Commitments, no such waiver, 
 amendment or modification to the Guarantee and Security Agreement shall (A) release any

 Security Documents, (B) release any guarantor representing more than 10 of the Stockholders 
 Equity under the Guarantee and Security Agreement from its guarantee obligations thereunder, 
 or (C) amend the definition of Collateral under the Security Documents (except to add

 the Liens created under the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional 
 obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to 
 all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby except that no such consent 
 described in clause (i) or (ii) above shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby 
 authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower) to direct the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee 
 and Security Agreement, to (1) release any Lien covering property (and to release any such 
 guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a

 economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their 
 stockholders and or their affiliates. The Borrower, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries, 
 agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, 
 fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Lender, on the 
 one hand, and the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, its stockholders or its Affiliates, on the 
 other. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries each acknowledge and agree that (i) the 
 transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies 
 hereunder and thereunder) are arm s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the

 whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise the Borrower or any of its 
 Subsidiaries, their stockholders or their affiliates on other matters) and (y) each Lender is acting 
 hereunder solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Borrower or any of its 
 Subsidiaries, their management or stockholders. The Borrower and each Obligor each 
 acknowledge and agree that it has consulted legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed 
 appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to 
 such transactions and the process leading thereto. The Borrower and each Obligor each agree that 
 it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services hereunder of any nature or 
 respect, or owes a fiduciary duty to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in 
 connection with such transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto.

 the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Obligors shall be entitled to rely upon and deal

 Loans to its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and or credit 
 facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the 
 securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans (but nothing contained herein shall be 
 construed in derogation of the obligation of the Granting Lender to make Loans hereunder)

 amendments or waivers hereunder except for those amendments or waivers for which the consent 
 of participants is required under paragraph (f) below, and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis (in

 the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing 
 Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in

 Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this 
 Agreement or any other Loan Document provided that such agreement or instrument may 
 provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any 
 amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects 
 such Participant. Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each 
 Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13 , 2.14 and 2.15 (subject to the

 Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment

 the provisions of Section 2.18 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04 . 
 Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use 
 reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.18

 entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant 
 agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(d) as though it were a Lender hereunder. Each Lender that 
 sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, 
 maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal 
 amounts and stated interest of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under 
 the Loan Documents (each a Participant Register provided , that no Lender shall have any 
 obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any 
 Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans,

 extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or 
 other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury 
 Regulations. The entries in each Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, 
 and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the 
 owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the 
 contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as the 
 Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

 receive any greater payment under Section 2.13 , 2.14 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would 
 have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the 
 sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent. A 
 Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits 
 of Section 2.15 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and

 at the time of such assignment to be a Defaulting Lender, a Subsidiary of a Defaulting Lender or 
 a Person who, upon consummation of such assignment would be a Defaulting Lender. 
 (j) Multicurrency Lenders . Any assignment by a Multicurrency Lender, so 
 long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Borrower, must

 (c) of the definition of Agreed Foreign Currency .

 Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State 
 Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform 
 Electronic Transactions Act. 
 SECTION 9.07 Severability . Any provision of this Agreement held to be 
 invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to 
 the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality 
 and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof and the invalidity of a particular provision 
 in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
 SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff . If an Event of Default shall have occurred and 
 be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from 
 time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits 
 (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever Currency) at any time held 
 and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or any such Affiliate 
 to or for the credit or the account of any Obligor against any of and all the obligations of any 
 Obligor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by 
 such Lender or Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Issuing Bank shall 
 have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent 
 and unmatured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or Issuing Bank 
 different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such 
 Indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this 
 Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such 
 Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate may have provided that in the event that any Defaulting 
 Lender exercises any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately 
 to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 
 2.17 and, pending such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other 
 funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and 
 the Lenders and (b) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a 
 statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to 
 which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and 
 the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender provided 
 that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

 which the specification of Dollars or any Foreign Currency, as the case may be (the Specified 
 Currency ), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case 
 may be (the Specified Place ), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the 
 currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The 
 payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged or satisfied 
 by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or 
 otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and 
 transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the 
 Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining 
 judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency 
 into another currency (the Second Currency ), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be 
 the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could 
 purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding 
 the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any 
 such sum due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan 
 Document (in this Section called an Entitled Person shall, notwithstanding the rate of 
 exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on 
 the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due from 
 the Borrower hereunder in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with 
 normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency 
 with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due and the Borrower hereby, as a 
 separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled 
 Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency, the 
 amount (if any) by which the sum originally due from the Borrower to such Entitled Person in 
 the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased 
 and transferred.

 capacity as Collateral Agent), the Lenders and the Issuing Bank agrees to maintain the 
 confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed

 agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such 
 disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed 
 to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority 
 purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority), (c) to the extent 
 required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any 
 other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any 
 other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan 
 Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement 
 containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or 
 Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations

 derivative or securitization transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations or (iii) to any 
 credit insurance provider relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the 
 Borrower, (h) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the 
 Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the Loans and (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar

 For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or 
 any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their 
 respective businesses (including any Portfolio Investments), other than any such information that 
 is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential 
 basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of 
 information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date, such 
 information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to 
 maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to 
 have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care 
 to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own 
 confidential information. 
 SECTION 9.14 USA PATRIOT Act . Each Lender hereby notifies the 
 Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 
 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), it is required to obtain, verify and record 
 information that identifies each Obligor, which information includes the name and address of 
 such Obligor and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Obligor in

 agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto 
 acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan 
 Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and 
 conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and 
 acknowledges and agrees to be bound by 
 (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the 
 applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable 
 to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution and 
 (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if

 (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other 
 instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a 
 bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such 
 shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with

 contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan 
 Documents shall not exceed the Maximum Rate. If Administrative Agent or any Lender shall 
 receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied

 determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by Administrative Agent or 
 a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable 
 law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than

 allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the 
 contemplated term of the Secured Obligations hereunder.

 extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedging 
 Agreements or any other agreements or instrument that is a QFC (such support, QFC Credit 
 Support and each such QFC a Supported QFC ), the parties acknowledge and agree as 
 follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under 
 the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
 Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the U.S. 
 Special Resolution Regimes in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with 
 the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported 
 QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and or of the 
 United States or any other state of the United States) 
 (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a 
 Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the 
 transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest 
 and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in 
 property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party 
 will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special 
 Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, 
 obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the 
 United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes 
 subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan 
 Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that 
 may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent 
 than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the 
 Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a 
 state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that 
 rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the 
 rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

 meanings 
 (i) BHC Act Affiliate of a party means an affiliate (as such term is 
 defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.

 accordance with, 12 C.F.R. 47.3(b) or 

178 

(C) a covered FSI as that term is defined in, and interpreted in 
 accordance with, 12 C.F.R. 382.2(b).
