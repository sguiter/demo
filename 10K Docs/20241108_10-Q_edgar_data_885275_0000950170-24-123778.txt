Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows: Construction, land development and farmland: Loans for non-owner-occupied real estate construction or land development are generally repaid through cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. The Company also finances construction loans for owner-occupied properties. A portion of the Company s construction and land portfolio segment is comprised of loans secured by residential product types (residential land and single-family construction). Construction and land development loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, market sales activity, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans generally rely on estimates of project costs and the anticipated value of the completed project, while the Company strives to ensure the accuracy of these estimates, it is possible for these estimates to be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayments substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, the value of the completed project, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. Residential 1-4 family real estate: Residential real estate loans represent loans to consumers or investors to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed on to year amortization terms, but generally with shorter maturities of to years. Many of these loans are extended to borrowers to finance their primary or secondary residence. Loans to an investor secured by a 1-4 family residence will be repaid from either the rental income from the property or from the sale of the property. This loan segment also includes closed-end home equity loans that are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence. This allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Loans in this portfolio segment are underwritten and approved based on a number of credit quality criteria including limits on maximum Loan-to-Value ("LTV") ratios, minimum credit scores, and maximum debt to income ratios. Real estate market values as of the time the loan is made directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these residential property values impact the depth of potential losses in this portfolio segment. 1-4 family equity lines of credit: This loan segment includes open-end home equity loans that are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence. This allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home utilizing a revolving line of credit. These loans are underwritten and approved based on a number of credit quality criteria including limits on maximum LTV ratios, minimum credit scores, and maximum debt to income ratios. Real estate market values as of the time the loan is made directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these residential property values impact the depth of potential losses in this

. These loans are made with either fixed or variable interest rates that are based on specific indices. Installment loans fill a variety of needs, such as financing the purchase of an automobile, a boat, a recreational vehicle or other large personal items, or for consolidating debt. These loans may be unsecured or secured by an assignment of title, as in an automobile loan, or by money in a bank account. In addition to consumer installment loans, this portfolio segment also includes secured and unsecured personal lines of credit as well as overdraft protection lines. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer economic measures. Allowance For Credit Losses ("ACL") - Loans. The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 326 ("ASC 326") Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for portfolios of loans when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Expected credit losses for collateral dependent loans are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. The Company s discounted cash flow methodology incorporates a probability of default and loss given default model, as well as expectations of future economic conditions, using reasonable and supportable forecasts. Together, the probability of default and loss given default model with the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts generate estimates for cash flows expected and not expected to be collected over the estimated life of a loan. Estimates of future expected cash flows ultimately reflect assumptions made concerning net credit losses over the life of a loan. The use of reasonable and supportable forecasts requires significant judgment. Management leverages economic projections from reputable and independent third parties to inform and provide its reasonable and supportable

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, which often is determined when the principal or interest on the loan is 90 days or more past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Generally, all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status, is reversed against current income. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received while the loan is classified as nonaccrual, but interest income recognition is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A nonaccrual loan is returned to accruing status once the loan has been brought current and collection is reasonably assured or the loan has been well-secured through other techniques. Past due status is determined based on the contractual due date per the underlying loan agreement.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02 which eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") and requires disclosures for certain loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For the loans included in the "combination" columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. The combination is at least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, an other-than-insignificant payment delay and/or an interest rate reduction. The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or nine months ended September 30, 2023, by class and type of modification. The percentage of the amortized cost basis of loans that were modified to borrowers in financial distress as compared to each class of financing receivable is also presented below.

There were payment defaults during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023 on loans that had been modified in the nine months prior to September 30, 2023. Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or a portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged off. Therefore, the amortized costs basis of the loan is reduced by the amount deemed uncollectible and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. As of September 30, 2024 there were in co nsumer mortgage loans in process of foreclosure. There were consumer mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure as of December 31, 2023.

million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by the FDIC, the Bank s primary federal regulator, for loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful. The following summary presents the Bank's loan balances by primary loan classification and the amount classified within each risk rating category. Pass rated loans include all credits other than those included in special mention, substandard and doubtful which are defined as follows: Special mention loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank s credit position at some future date. 

 Substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

 Doubtful loans have all the characteristics of substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The Bank considers all doubtful loans to be collateral dependent and places such loans on nonaccrual status.

The applicable date for determining when securities are in an unrealized loss position is September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

allowance for credit losses is considered necessary related to available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024. These securities will continue to be monitored as a part of the Company's ongoing evaluation of credit quality. Mortgage-Backed Securities At September 30, 2024, approximately of the mortgage-backed securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. Because the decline in fair value of these securities is largely attributable to interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company has determined allowance for credit losses is necessary at September 30, 2024. The Company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio includes non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations with a fair value of million which had unrealized losses of approximately million at September 30, 2024. These non-agency mortgage-backed securities were rated AAA at September 30, 2024. The Company monitors to ensure it has adequate credit support and does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions Unrealized losses on municipal bonds have not been recognized into income because the issuers' bonds are of high credit quality (rated A or higher) or the bonds have been refunded. Management does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that management will be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity. Asset-Backed Securities The Company's asset-backed securities portfolio includes agency and non-agency asset backed and other amortizing debt securities with a fair value of million which had unrealized losses of approximately million at September 30, 2024. The Company monitors these securities to ensure it has adequate credit support and does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. Corporate Bonds The Company's lone corporate debt security with a fair value of million had an unrealized loss of approximately million at September 30, 2024 . The Company monitors this security to ensure it has adequate credit support and does not have the intent to sell this security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. The issuer continues to make timely principal and interest payments on the bond.

Mortgage Banking Derivatives Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors under the Bank's mandatory delivery program are considered derivatives. It is the Company's practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in an effort to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately and , respectively, of interest rate lock commitments and approximately and , respectively, of forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans. The fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives was reflected by a derivative asset of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and a derivative asset of and derivative liability of at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. In cases where quoted market prices or observable components are not available, fair values are based on estimates using discounted cash flow models. Those models are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates, estimates of future cash flows and borrower creditworthiness. The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Such amounts have not been revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since those dates and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1. Loans The fair value of our loan portfolio includes a credit risk factor in the determination of the fair value of our loans. This credit risk assumption is intended to approximate the fair value that a market participant would realize in a hypothetical orderly transaction. Our loan portfolio is initially fair valued using a segmented approach. We divide our loan portfolio into the following categories: variable rate loans, collateral dependent loans and all other loans. The results are then adjusted to account for credit risk. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values approximate carrying values. Fair values for collateral dependent loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the

A typical arrangement involves the applicant routinely being indebted to the beneficiary for such items as inventory purchases, insurance, utilities, lease guarantees or other third party commercial transactions. The standby letter of credit would permit the beneficiary to obtain payment from the Bank under certain prescribed circumstances. Subsequently, the Bank would then seek reimbursement from the applicant pursuant to the terms of the standby letter of credit. The Bank follows the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed in the table above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 2 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses as if such commitments were funded.

The Bank originates residential mortgage loans, sells them to third-party purchasers, and may or may not retain the servicing rights. These loans are originated internally and are primarily to borrowers in the Bank s geographic market footprint. These sales are typically to investors that follow guidelines of conventional government sponsored entities ("GSE") and the Department of Housing and Urban Development/U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("HUD/VA"). Generally, loans held for sale are underwritten by the Bank, including HUD/VA loans. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bank began to participate in a mandatory delivery program that requires the Bank to deliver a particular volume of mortgage loans by agreed upon dates. A majority of the Bank s secondary mortgage volume is delivered to the secondary market via mandatory delivery with the remainder done on a best efforts basis. The Bank does not realize any exposure to delivery penalties as the Bank's mortgage department only bids loans post-closing to ensure that of the loans are deliverable to the investors. Each purchaser has specific guidelines and criteria for sellers of loans, and the risk of credit loss with regard to the principal amount of the loans sold is generally transferred to the purchasers upon sale. While the loans are sold without recourse, the purchase

Item 2. Management s Discussion an d Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The purpose of this discussion is to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of Wilson Bank Holding Company (the "Company", "our" or "we") and its bank subsidiary, Wilson Bank Trust (the "Bank") and Encompass Home Lending LLC ("Encompass"), a company offering mortgage banking services that is 51 owned by the Bank and 49 owned by two home builders operating in the Bank's market areas. The results of Encompass, which commenced operations on June 1, 2022, are consolidated in the Company's financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Reference should also be made to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 28, 2024 (the "2023 Form 10-K") for a more complete discussion of factors that impact the Company's liquidity, capital and results of operations. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") regarding, among other things, the anticipated financial and operating results of the Company. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any modifications or revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 
 
 The Company cautions investors that future financial and operating results may differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. The words expect, intend, should, may, could, believe, suspect, anticipate, seek, plan, estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but other statements not based on historical fact may also be considered forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those described in the 2023 Form 10-K, and also include, without limitation, (i) deterioration in the financial condition of borrowers resulting in significant increases in credit losses and provisions for these losses, (ii) deterioration in the real estate market conditions in the Company s market areas including demand for residential real estate loans as a result of elevated rates on residential real estate mortgage loans, (iii) the impact of increased competition with other financial institutions, including pricing pressures on loans and deposits, and the resulting impact on the Company's results, including as a result of compression to net interest margin, (iv) adverse conditions in local or national economies, including the economy in the Company s market areas, including as a result of the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions, political uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the elevated rate environment, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages on our customers and on their businesses, (v) the sale of investment securities in a loss position before their value recovers, including as a result of asset liability management strategies or in response to liquidity needs, (vi) fluctuations or differences in interest rates on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities from those that the Company is modeling or anticipating, including as a result of the Bank's inability to maintain deposit rates or defer increases to those rates in an elevated rate environment or lower rates in a falling rate environment, (vii) the ability to grow and retain low-cost core deposits, (viii) significant downturns in the business of one or more large customers, (ix) the inability of the Company to comply with regulatory capital requirements, including those resulting from changes to capital calculation methodologies, required capital maintenance levels, or regulatory requests or directives, (x) changes in state or Federal regulations, policies, or legislation applicable to banks and other financial service providers, including regulatory or legislative developments arising out of current unsettled conditions in the economy, (xi) changes in capital levels and loan underwriting, credit review or loss reserve policies associated with economic conditions, examination conclusions, or regulatory developments, (xii) inadequate allowance for credit losses, (xiii) the effectiveness of the Company s activities in improving, resolving or liquidating lower quality assets, (xiv) results of regulatory examinations, (xv) the vulnerability of the Company's network and online banking portals, and the systems of parties with whom the Company contracts, to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, social engineering, fraud, spam attacks, ransomware attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss, and other security breaches, (xvi) the possibility of additional increases to compliance costs or other operational expenses as a result of increased regulatory oversight, (xvii) loss of key personnel, and (xviii) adverse results (including costs, fines, reputational harm and/or other negative effects) from current or future litigation, examinations or other legal and/or regulatory actions. These risks and uncertainties may cause the actual results or performance of the Company to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company s future operating results depend on a number of factors which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 
 
 We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
 42 

Table of Contents 

with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information, forecasted economic conditions, and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 
 Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This Quarterly Report contains certain financial measures that are not measures recognized under U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Members of Company management use these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company s performance. Management of the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods. Management of the Company also believes that investors find these non-GAAP financial measures useful as they assist investors in understanding underlying operating performance and identifying and analyzing ongoing operating trends. However, the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein are calculated may differ from the manner in which measures with similar names are calculated by other companies. You should understand how other companies calculate their financial measures similar to, or with names similar to, the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed herein when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 The non-GAAP measures in this Quarterly Report include pre-tax pre-provision income, pre-tax pre-provision basic earnings per share, pre-tax pre-provision annualized return on average shareholders' equity, and pre-tax pre-provision annualized return on average assets. A reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included below.

Results of Operations 
 
 Net earnings of the Company increased 3,875,000 , or 10.27 , to 41,591,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 37,716,000 in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in net earnings for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by increases in non-interest expense and provision for credit losses. 
 
 Net earnings of the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 12,686,000, an increase of 1,200,000, or 10.45 , from 11,486,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net earnings for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by increases in non-interest expense and provision for credit losses, as well as a decrease in non-interest income. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to management's decision to strategically restructure the securities portfolio, which resulted in 1,414,000 of net losses from sales of 86,515,000 of available-for-sale securities. 
 
 The increase in net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable periods in 2023 was due to an increase in average interest earning asset balances and an increase in the average yield earned on earning assets, partially offset by an increase in cost of funds and an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances. 
 
 The changes in non-interest income and non-interest expenses are discussed in more detail below in the sections of this report titled, "Non-Interest Income" and "Non-Interest Expense". The changes in provision for credit losses is discussed in more detail below in the section of this report titled "Provision For Credit Losses". 
 
 Return on average assets (ROA) and return on average shareholders' equity (ROE) are common benchmarks for bank profitability and are calculated by taking our annualized net earnings for the relevant period and dividing that amount by our average assets and average equity for the relevant periods, respectively. ROA and ROE measure a company s return on investment in a format that is easily comparable to other financial institutions. ROA is particularly important to the Company as it serves as the basis for certain executive and employee bonuses. The ROA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.99 and 1.12 , respectively; while the ROA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.00 and 1.13 , respectively. The ROE for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.66 and 12.42 , respectively; while the ROE for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 11.65 and 12.96 , respectively. The decrease in ROA and ROE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was related to the increased provision for credit losses-loans in the third quarter of 2024 and the loss on sale of securities mentioned above. The decrease in ROA and ROE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to an increase in non-interest expense and the loss on sale of securities mentioned above, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses-loans. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 The average balances, interest, and average rates of our assets and liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands):

Net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.29 and 3.33 , respectively. The decrease in net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to an increase in the cost of funds, partially offset by an increase in average interest earning asset balances and an increase in the yield earned on such assets. The net interest spread was 2.87 and 3.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 2.94 and 2.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.39 and 3.18 , respectively. The increase in net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the increase in average interest earning asset balances and an increase in the yield earned on loans outpacing the increase in cost of funds as competitive pressures continued to improve in the third quarter of 2024. The yield on loans increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable periods in 2023 due to the higher rates charged on new loans and the repricing of a portion of the Bank's variable rate loan portfolio. 
 
 The direction and speed with which short-term interest rates move has an impact on our net interest income. The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit decreased by 50 basis points as the Federal Reserve cut the target rate for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points on September 18, 2024. 
 
 If short term rates continue to decline, as the Company believes is likely to happen in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company s net interest margin and earnings could be negatively impacted if the yields on loans decrease faster than the Company is able to lower deposit rates, including as a result of loan growth outpacing our ability to add lower cost core deposits or competitive pressures in our markets limiting our ability to reduce the rates we pay on deposits. However, if the Company is able to reprice its deposits more quickly than it reprices the rates it earns on loans in such a falling rate environment, the Company expects its net interest margin would expand. 
 
 Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of the Company s earnings. Net interest income, excluding tax equivalent adjustments relating to tax exempt securities and loans, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 41,015,000 and 115,036,000, respectively. Net interest income, excluding tax equivalent adjustments relating to tax exempt securities and loans, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 34,160,000 and 103,643,000, respectively. 
 
 The increase in net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable periods in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of average interest earning assets, an increase in interest and fees on loans, an increase in interest earned on deposits with depository institutions, and an increase in interest and dividends earned on 
 49 

Table of Contents 

securities, partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from the increase in the cost of funds and an increase in the volume of average interest bearing deposits. 
 
 The ratio of average earning assets to total average assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 96.0 and 95.8 , respectively, compared to 95.4 and 95.3 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Interest expense increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable periods in 2023 due to an increase in the average balance of our interest bearing deposits combined with competitive pressures in the second half of 2023 and first part of 2024 in the elevated short-term interest rate environment which required the Bank to raise rates paid on deposits. Also negatively impacting interest expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was Bank's customers' continued shift of deposits from transaction and money market accounts to time deposit accounts. As competitive pressures have begun to ease in the second half of the third quarter of 2024, and the 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in late September 2024 has taken effect, we have begun to lower interest rates on some of our deposit products and anticipate that we will be able to continue to lower the rates we pay on deposits for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 as time deposits reprice; however, if the competitive pressures begin to rise once again, the Federal Reserve does not cut the federal funds rate any further or at the pace we are anticipating or loan growth outpaces deposit growth, the Bank may have to lower rates at a slower pace. Despite the expectation the Bank will be able to lower rates paid on deposits, we expect interest expense to continue to increase due to an increase in overall deposit balances. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. The determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed discussion regarding ACL methodology. 
 
 The provision for credit losses-loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,563,000 compared to a provision of 1,641,000 and 5,681,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively . Significant loan growth in the third quarter and a single relationship downgrade during that quarter, partially offset by an improved economic outlook, contributed to management's decision in the third quarter of 2024 to record a provision of 3,563,000 after recording no provision in the first six months of 2024. 
 
 As discussed below under Financial Condition-Loans , loan growth was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods for 2023. Loan growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 393,851,000, while loan growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 379,987,000. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 loan growth was 231,968,000 compared to 117,297,000 for three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 There was a benefit to the provision for credit losses-off balance sheet exposures of 563,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit of 677,000 and 2,975,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. A slight decline in unfunded balances for the first nine months of 2024 and an improved economic outlook in the third quarter of 2024 led to the release in the off balance sheet exposures in the third quarter of 2024.

The provision for credit losses-loans charged to operating expense requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Other factors which, in management s judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating expected credit losses include growth and composition of the loan portfolio, review of specific problem loans, the relationship of the allowance for credit losses to outstanding loans, adverse situations that may affect our borrowers' ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions that may affect our borrowers' ability to pay. 
 
 There was no provision for credit losses on available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable period in 2023 is primarily attributable to an increase in loss on sale of securities, partially offset by an increase in brokerage income. The increase in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage income, an increase in service charges on deposit accounts, and an increase in gain on sale of loans, partially offset by an increase in the loss on sale of securities and a loss on sale of fixed assets. 
 
 The increase in brokerage income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable time periods in 2023 was primarily due to multiple client acquisitions, the completion of estate planning cases, and an increase of overall market share in our market areas as well as the positive performance of financial markets. 
 
 The increase in gain on sale of loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable time period in 2023 was primarily due to the declining mortgage interest rate market positively impacting the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments. 
 
 The increase in service charges on deposit accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable time period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in overdraft fees as a result of an increase in transaction volume. 
 
 The increase in loss on sale of securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable time period in 2023 was due to management's decision in the third quarter of 2024 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and restructure the securities portfolio in an attempt to improve the Bank's positioning relative to interest rate risk. This restructuring included the sale of approximately 86.5 million of available-for-sale securities that were in a loss position for a net loss of 1.4 million and the reinvestment of a portion of the net proceeds in higher yielding securities. The Company also sold 2.5 million of investment securities in the second quarter of 2024 for a net loss of 318,000. 
 
 The loss on sale of fixed assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to write-offs associated with the closure of our leased Wal-Mart branch that we closed on January 13, 2024. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense 
 
 Non-interest expense consists primarily of employee costs, occupancy expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, advertising and public relations expenses, data processing expenses, director s fees, audit, legal and consulting fees, FDIC insurance and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

The increase in non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable period in 2023 is primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits, increases in data processing expenses, and an increase in other operating expenses, partially offset by reduced occupancy expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, and advertising and public relations expenses. Also offsetting a portion of the increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a decrease in FDIC insurance costs. 
 
 Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in the number of employees necessary to support the Company s growth in operations, an increase in incentives and commissions paid due to the increase in loan volume and a large investment relationship obtained, and a one-time company-wide employee bonus triggered by the Bank reaching an asset milestone.

Data processing expenses increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to implementation of a new small business online solution, enhanced treasury management solution, and an increase in the number of customers using digital services. The Company anticipates that data processing expenses will continue to increase as the Company s operations grow, the demand for digital products and services from customers increases, and the cyber threat environment grows. 
 
 The increase in other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable periods in 2023 was primarily due to costs associated with a new employee development program, including employee engagement activities. Also contributing to the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were increased mailing costs associated with the mailing of account change notices and the Company's annual report to shareholders. 
 
 The decrease in occupancy expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the closure of our leased Wal-Mart branch that we closed on January 13, 2024. 
 
 The decrease in furniture and equipment expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense which resulted from the full depreciation of the Company's operations building equipment and Cool Springs branch equipment. 
 
 The decrease in advertising and public relations expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the competitive rate environment experienced in 2023, which caused the Bank to increase marketing efforts focused on driving deposit growth. 
 
 FDIC insurance expense decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a change in the Bank's assessment rate. 
 
 The efficiency ratio is a common and comparable KPI used in the banking industry. The Company uses this metric to monitor how effective management is at using our internal resources. It is calculated by dividing our non-interest expense by our net interest income plus non-interest income. The efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 58.68 and 58.98 , respectively. The efficiency ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 59.12 and 62.02 , respectively. The improvement in the efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023 was primarily due to the increases in net interest income and non-interest income outpacing the increase in non-interest expense. The improvement in the efficiency ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023 was primarily due to the increase in net interest income outpacing the increase in non-interest expense. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company s income tax expense was 12,042,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1,088,000 over the comparable period in 2023. The percentage of income tax expense to net income before taxes was 22.41 and 22.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,665,000, an increase of 399,000 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The percentage of income tax expense to net income taxes was 22.38 and 22.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate represents our blended federal and state rate of 26.14 affected by the impact of anticipated favorable permanent differences between our book and taxable income such as share based compensation, bank-owned life insurance, income earned on tax-exempt securities and loans, and certain federal and state tax credits, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense and non-deductible executive compensation.

Overall, the Bank's loan demand and related new loan production continued to increase throughout the Bank's markets in the third quarter of 2024, yielding a year-to-date total loan growth net of deferred loan fees of 10.95 . Total loan growth net of deferred loan fees for the first nine months of 2024 was 393,851,000, with 231,968,000 of that growth occurring in the third quarter. Contributing to the Company's loan growth in the first nine months of 2024 were the continued population growth and corporate relocations in the Bank's primary market areas and increased marketing efforts. The increase in residential 1-4 family real estate loans is attributable to the Bank successfully growing its residential portfolio through enhanced marketing efforts directed at homebuilders in the Company's market areas, and the increase the Company is seeing in the investor sector of 1-4 family. The increase in commercial and multi-family real estate and 1-4 family equity lines of credit is primarily attributable to continued economic growth and expansion in the Bank's primary market areas. The Company anticipates that loan growth for the second half of 2024 will exceed the loan growth experienced in the first half of 2024. 
 
 Because construction loans remain a meaningful portion of our portfolio, the Bank has implemented an additional layer of monitoring as it seeks to avoid advancing funds that exceed the present value of the collateral securing the loan. The responsibility for monitoring percentage of completion and distribution of funds tied to these completion percentages is now monitored and administered by a Credit Administration Department independent of the lending function. The Bank continues to seek to diversify its real estate portfolio as it seeks to lessen concentrations in any one type of loan. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio when calculating our allowance for credit losses for loans. The provision for credit losses for loans represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management s evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses on loans. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the collectibility of a loan balance is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses for loans is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivables, as we promptly charge off accrued interest receivable determined to be uncollectible. We determine the appropriateness of the allowance through quarterly discounted cash flow modeling of the loan portfolio which considers lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, we may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses for loans at September 30, 2024 reflects an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover all expected future losses as of the date the allowance is determined based on our allowance for credit losses for loans assessment methodology. The allowance for credit losses for loans (net of charge-offs and recoveries) increased to 48,042,000 at September 30, 2024 from 44,848,000 at December 31, 2023, due to significant loan growth in the third quarter and a single relationship downgrade, partially offset by an improved economic outlook, which contributed to management's decision in the third quarter of 2024 to record a provision of 3,563,000 after recording no provision in the first six months of 2024. The allowance for credit losses for loans was 1.20 of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.25 at December 31, 2023. The internally classified loans as a percentage of the allowance for credit losses for loans were 98.5 and 13.2 respectively, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the credit downgrades and deterioration in payment performance of a few large borrowers.

The allowance for credit losses for loans is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb expected losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible as of the measurement date. The allowance for credit losses for loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2024, net of deferred fees, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an improved economic outlook for GDP, unemployment, and home prices as mentioned above. 
 
 We measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing two methods. For residential 1-4 family, commercial and multi-family real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, 1-4 family equity lines of credit, municipal, and certain other loan types, we use discounted cash flow models which measure probability of default and loss given default. For farmland, agricultural, credit cards, auto, and other consumer loans we use the remaining life method to estimate credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses for loan segments utilizing discounted cash flow is impacted by certain macroeconomic variables. Models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. 
 
 In estimating expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024, we utilized then available forecasts of macroeconomic variables over our reasonable and supportable horizon based on the review of a variety of forecasts of the U.S. economy provided by Moody's Analytics. Key economic variables as forecasted and utilized in our models include: (i) U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") with annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of 1.9 to 2.2 ; (ii) a U.S. unemployment rate in the range of approximately 4.0 to 4.2 ; and (iii) a Home Price Index annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of approximately 1.0 to 3.2 . 
 
 We adjust model results using qualitative factor ("Q-factor") adjustments. Q-Factor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures; economic and business conditions; loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations; and external factors, among other things, that are not already captured within the modeling inputs, assumptions and other processes. Management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of major risk to improvement and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment. 
 
 Our charge-off policy for collateral dependent loans is similar to our charge-off policy for all loans in that loans are charged-off in the month when a determination is made that the loan is uncollectible. Net charge-offs decreased to 369,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 793,000 for the same period in 2023. The ratio of net charge-offs to average total outstanding loans was 0.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 182,000 and 303,000, 
 55 

Table of Contents 

respectively. Overall, the Bank experienced minimal charge-offs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and it is expected that charge-offs will continue to be modest for the remainder of 2024; however, a deterioration in local economic conditions may negatively impact charge-offs in the future. 
 
 We also maintain an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures, which decreased 563,000 from December 31, 2023 to 2,584,000 at September 30, 2024 as a result of a decrease in our off-balance sheet commitments and an increase in our unconditionally cancellable commitments. 
 
 The level of the allowance and the amount of the provision for credit losses involve evaluation of uncertainties and matters of judgment. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for loans which management believes is adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio. A formal calculation is prepared quarterly by the Company's Chief Financial Officer and provided to the Board of Directors to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The calculation includes an evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and forecasted economic conditions, an evaluation of qualitative factors, industry and peer bank loan quality indicators and other factors. See the discussion above under Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates for more information. Management believes the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 to be adequate, but if forecasted economic conditions do not meet management s current expectations, the allowance for credit losses may require an increase through additional provision for credit loss expense which would negatively impact earnings. 
 
 For a detailed discussion regarding our allowance for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses above. 
 
 Securities 
 
 Securities increased 12,974,000, or 1.60 , to 824,055,000 at September 30, 2024 from 811,081,000 at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the purchase of 124,927,000 in new available-for-sale securities and an increase in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities of 26,365,000 as a result of favorable movement in interest rates, partially offset by the sale of 88,986,000 of securities discussed above and the run-off of our declining balance securities of 45,203,000. As mentioned above, management decided to restructure a portion of the securities portfolio in the third quarter of 2024. The restructuring involved the purchase of approximately 40,982,000 in new securities and the sale of approximately 86,515,000 in securities, both of which are included in the purchase and sale figures above. The average yield, excluding tax equivalent adjustment, of the securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 was 2.40 with a weighted average life of 7.06 years, as compared to an average yield of 2.33 and a weighted average life of 8.25 years at December 31, 2023. The weighted average lives on mortgage-backed securities reflect the repayment rate used for book value calculations. 
 
 Premises and Equipment 
 
 Premises and equipment decreased 603,000, or 0.97 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The primary reason for the decrease was due to current year depreciation of 3,008,000 and write-offs due to the closure of a leased branch office location, partially offset by the purchase of equipment and furniture and fixtures, and the remodeling of several branches. 
 
 Deposits and Other Liabilities 
 
 Deposits increased by 339,475,000, or 7.77 , in the first nine months of 2024 due to a strategic focus on growing customers by utilizing deposit promotions. Included in deposits at September 30, 2024 were 19,140,000 in brokered deposits, compared to 69,135,000 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in brokered deposits from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was the result of management's decision to not renew some brokered deposits when they matured, as the Company has been able to grow lower cost core deposits.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimate that we had approximately 1.4 billion and 1.2 billion in uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit amounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. Approximately 29 of our total deposits exceeded the FDIC deposit insurance limits at September 30, 2024. However, we offer large depositors access to the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and the Insured Cash Sweep ICS Product ), which allows us to divide customers' deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limits into smaller amounts, below the FDIC insurance limits, and place those excess deposits in other participating FDIC insured institutions with the convenience of managing all deposit accounts through our Bank. Our total deposits in CDARS and the ICS Products increased to 166,404,000, or 3.54 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024, compared to 104,204,000, or 2.39 of total deposits, at December 31, 2023.

The increase in total liabilities since December 31, 2023 was composed of a 339,475,000, or 7.77 , increase in total deposits and an 11,882,000, or 23.78 , increase in accrued interest and other liabilities. The increase in total deposits since December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to growth in market share and concerted marketing efforts to drive deposit growth which resulted in the opening of new deposit accounts. The increase in accrued interest and other liabilities since December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest payable on deposits and an increase in employee bonus payable, partially offset by a decrease in reserve for off-balance sheet commitments. 
 
 Non-Performing Assets 
 
 Non-performing loans, which included nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days past due, at September 30, 2024 totaled 5,905,000, an increase of 4,496,000 from 1,409,000 at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to one commercial real estate loan, one 1-4 family equity line of credit, and one residential 1-4 family real estate loan, all of which are on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. Management believes that it is probable that it will incur losses on its non-performing loans but believes that these losses should not exceed the amount in the allowance for credit losses for loans already allocated to these loans, unless there is unanticipated deterioration of local real estate values. 
 
 The net non-performing asset ratio (NPA) is used as a measure of the overall quality of the Company's assets. Our NPA ratio is calculated by taking the total of our loans that are 90 days or more past due and accruing interest, nonaccrual loans and other real 
 57 

Table of Contents 

estate owned and dividing that sum by our total assets outstanding. Our NPA ratio for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 0.11 and 0.03 , respectively. 
 
 Other loans may be classified as collateral dependent when the current net worth and financial capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any, is viewed as inadequate and it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Such loans generally have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and if such deficiencies are not corrected, there is a probability that the Company will sustain some loss. In such cases, interest income continues to accrue as long as the loan does not meet the Company s criteria for nonaccrual status. Collateral dependent loans are measured at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. If the fair value of the collateral dependent loan less estimated selling costs is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the Company shall recognize impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for credit losses or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the collateral dependent loan with a corresponding charge or credit to the provision for credit losses. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 the Company had a recorded investment in collateral dependent loans totaling 37,751,000, an increase of 32,913,000 from a recorded investment in collateral dependent loans totaling 4,838,000 at December 31, 2023. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the deterioration in payment performance and downgrade of a few large borrowers for which we believe the majority of the loans to be well-collateralized. Management has developed and continues to execute performance improvement plans on these relationships and is working to mitigate the credit risk of the loans in order to reduce our potential exposure to credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, a 402,000 valuation allowance was recorded on collateral dependent loans due to one loan relationship. As of December 31, 2023, no valuation allowance was recorded on collateral dependent loans. The allowance for credit losses for loans related to collateral dependent loans was measured based upon the estimated fair value of related collateral less estimated selling costs. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, as a result of the downgrade of a few large borrowers mentioned above, our internally classified loans increased 41,400,000, or 701.69 , to 47,300,000 from 5,900,000 at December 31, 2023. Loans are listed as classified when information obtained about possible credit problems of the borrower has prompted management to question the ability of the borrower to comply with the repayment terms of the loan agreement. Management continues to develop and execute performance improvement plans with these select few borrowers and continues to believe these loans are well collateralized. If economic uncertainty remains in the market, or management's performance improvement plan proves to be unsuccessful, our classified loan balances could increase further. 
 
 Liquidity and Asset Liability Management 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The Company s management seeks to maximize net interest income by managing the Company s assets and liabilities within appropriate constraints on capital, liquidity and interest rate risk. Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash flow requirements, including inflows and outflows of cash for depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs. Several factors influence our liquidity needs, including depositor and borrower activity, interest rate trends, changes in the economy, maturities, re-pricing and interest rate sensitivity of our debt securities, loan portfolio and deposits. We strive to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity. We calculate our liquidity ratio by taking cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits, federal funds sold, and available-for-sale debt securities not pledged as collateral and dividing by total assets. Our total liquidity ratios were 11.65 at September 30, 2024 and 13.09 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in our liquidity ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in liquid assets as a result of an increase in the dollar amount of our available-for-sale securities that we have pledged to secure certain of our customers' deposits. 
 
 The Company s primary source of liquidity is a stable core deposit base. In addition, Federal funds purchased, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and brokered deposits provide a secondary source of liquidity. These sources of liquidity are generally short-term in nature and are used to fund asset growth and meet other short-term liquidity needs. Liquidity needs can also be met from loan payments and investment security sales or maturities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and debt securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. At September 30, 2024, the Company s liquid assets totaled 612.0 million, a decrease from 634.0 million at December 31, 2023, though a portion of these liquid assets include available-for-sale securities that are in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024. If the Company was required to sell any of these securities, including to meet liquidity needs, while they are in an unrealized loss position the Company would be required to recognize the loss on those securities through the income statement when they are sold. Recognition of these losses would negatively impact the Bank's and the Company's regulatory capital levels. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had available approximately 118.8 million in unused federal funds lines of credit with regional banks and, subject to certain restrictions and collateral requirements, approximately 518.6 million of borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati to meet short term funding needs. The Company maintains a formal asset and liability management process in an effort to quantify, monitor and control interest rate risk and to assist management as management seeks to maintain stability in net interest margin under varying interest rate environments. The Company accomplishes this process through the development and implementation of lending, funding and pricing strategies designed to maximize net interest income under varying interest rate environments subject to specific liquidity and interest rate risk guidelines and competitive market conditions.

Securities classified as available-for-sale include securities intended to be used as part of the Company s asset/liability strategy and/or securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rate, prepayment risk, or the need to fund loan demand or other liquidity needs. At September 30, 2024, securities totaling approximately 52.6 million mature or will be subject to rate adjustments within the next twelve months. 
 
 A secondary source of liquidity is the Company s loan portfolio. At September 30, 2024, loans totaling approximately 1.3 billion either will become due or will be subject to rate adjustments within twelve months from that date. 
 
 As for liabilities, at September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit of 250,000 or greater totaling approximately 643.9 million will become due or reprice during the next twelve months. Historically, there has been no significant reduction in immediately withdrawable accounts such as negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, money market demand accounts, demand deposit accounts and regular savings accounts. Management does not anticipate that there will be significant withdrawals from these accounts in the future. 
 
 Management believes that with present maturities, borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the efforts of management in its asset/liability management program, the Company should be able to meet its liquidity needs in the near term future. 
 
 Asset Liability Management 
 
 Analysis of rate sensitivity and rate gap analysis are the primary tools used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates. Included in the analysis are cash flows and maturities of financial instruments held for purposes other than trading, changes in market conditions, loan volumes and pricing and deposit volume and mix. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, as a result, net interest income cannot be precisely estimated nor can the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income be precisely predicted. Actual results will differ due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management s strategies, among other factors. 
 
 The Company also uses simulation modeling to evaluate both the level of interest rate sensitivity as well as potential balance sheet strategies. The Company's Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) meets quarterly to analyze the interest rate shock ("IRR") simulation. The interest rate shock simulation model is based on a number of assumptions. The assumptions include, but are not limited to, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet management strategies. We model instantaneous change in interest rates using a growth in the balance sheet as well as a flat balance sheet to understand the impact to earnings and capital. Based on the Company's IRR simulation, the Company had a neutral interest-rate risk position as of September 30, 2024, though the Company s net interest margin and earnings could be negatively impacted if short term interest rates continue to decline, which is the Company's current expectation, and the Company's yields on loans decrease faster than the Company is able to lower deposit rates, including as a result of loan growth outpacing our ability to add lower cost core deposits. Alternatively, if short-term rates remain elevated, or begin to rise again, and competitive pressures in the Company's market areas or funding needs force the Company to increase deposit rates faster than it is able to increase yields on loans, the Company's net interest margin and earnings could be negatively impacted. The Company also uses Economic Value of Equity EVE sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in interest rates on long-term cash flows, income and capital. EVE is calculated by discounting the cash flows for all balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios. The EVE is a longer term view of interest rate risk because it measures the present value of the future cash flows. Presented below is the estimated impact on the Bank s net interest income and EVE as of September 30, 2024, assuming an immediate shift in interest rates:

(1.19)

(5.17) 

(9.14) 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. Moreover, since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging strategies that we may institute, and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 
 Interest rate risk (sensitivity) management focuses on the earnings risk associated with changing interest rates. Management seeks to maintain profitability in both immediate and long-term earnings through funds management/interest rate risk management. The Company s rate sensitivity position has an important impact on earnings. Senior management of the Company analyzes the rate

sensitivity position quarterly. Management focuses on the spread between the Company s cost of funds and interest yields generated primarily through loans and investments. 
 
 In addition to the ALCO, the Audit Committee and the Risk Oversight Committee, as well as the Chief Risk Officer are all responsible for the risk management framework of the Company. The ALCO meets monthly and the Audit and Risk Oversight Committees meet quarterly, with the authority to convene additional meetings, as circumstances require. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had unfunded loan commitments outstanding of 1,126,833,000 and outstanding standby letters of credit of 103,322,000, compared to 1,010,899,000 and 106,420,000, respectively, at December 31, 2023. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions. Additionally, the Bank could sell participations in these or other loans to correspondent banks. As mentioned above, the Bank has historically been able to fund its ongoing liquidity needs through its stable core deposit base, loan payments, investment security maturities and short-term borrowings. 
 
 Capital Position and Dividends 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total shareholders equity was 483,483,000, or 9.21 of total assets, which compares with 429,405,000, or 8.86 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The dollar increase in shareholders equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of the net effect of 842,000 related to stock option compensation, restricted share awards, restricted share units, and performance share units, the Company s net earnings of 41,591,000, proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to exercise of stock options of 81,000 and a decrease of 19,474,000 in unrealized losses on investment securities (described elsewhere in this report), net of applicable income taxes of 6,891,000. Also included was 92,000 of net earnings attributable to Encompass. The increase in shareholders' equity was partially offset by cash dividends declared of 20,552,000, net of 14,731,000 reinvested under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan, and the 2,181,000 repurchase of common stock from a limited number of the Company's shareholders that occurred in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On October 28, 2024, the Company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 4.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program remains in effect through March 31, 2025. Share repurchases under the authorized program may be made from time to time in privately negotiated transactions, at the discretion of the management of the Company. The approved share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The timing of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not repurchased any shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative D isclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the Company s assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which possess a short term to maturity. Based upon the nature of the Company s operations, the Company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. 
 Interest rate risk (sensitivity) management focuses on the earnings risk associated with changing interest rates. Management seeks to maintain profitability in both short-term and long-term earnings through funds management/interest rate risk management. The Company s rate sensitivity position has an important impact on earnings. Senior management of the Company meets monthly to analyze the rate sensitivity position. These meetings focus on the spread between the cost of funds and interest yields generated primarily through loans and investments. 
 There have been no material changes in reported market risks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Overall, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
