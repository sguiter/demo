 million for the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2023 02. This transition adjustment included a million decrease in other assets, a million decrease in other liabilities, and a million increase in deferred tax assets. 
 In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 01 Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements, which requires amortization over the useful life of leasehold improvements (not the lease term) when the lease is between entities under common control, and any value of such leasehold improvements remaining at the end of the lease term is to be accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control. Busey adopted this standard on a prospective basis on January 1, 2024. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Busey s financial position or results of operations. 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03 Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which clarifies that contractual restrictions on the sale of equity securities are not considered in measuring the fair value of those equity securities, and further that contractual sale restrictions cannot be recognized and measured as a separate unit of account. Busey adopted this standard on a prospective basis on January 1, 2024. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Busey s financial position or results of operations. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards to clarify that certain profits interests are within the scope of Topic 718 by amending the language and providing illustrative examples on how the scope guidance in paragraph 718-10-15-3 should be applied. This update is intended to improve clarity of the accounting standards codification, not to change the guidance. This update may be applied on a retrospective or prospective basis and will be effective for Busey for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Busey is currently evaluating the potential effects of adoption of this ASU on its financial position and results of operations.

 Unrealized and unrecognized losses are related to changes in market interest rates and market conditions that do not represent credit-related impairments. Unless part of a corporate strategy or restructuring plan, Busey does not intend to sell securities that are in an unrealized or unrecognized loss position, and it is more likely than not that Busey will recover the amortized cost prior to being required to sell the debt securities. Full collection of the amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities is expected; therefore, no ACL has been recorded in relation to debt securities, and the impairment related to noncredit factors on debt securities available for sale is recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. As of September 30, 2024, Busey did not hold general obligation bonds of any single issuer, the aggregate of which exceeded 10 of Busey s stockholders equity.

 Capital Conservation Buffer 
 In July 2013, U.S. federal banking authorities approved the Basel III Rule for strengthening international capital standards. The Basel III Rule introduced a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital, which is added to the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is not a minimum capital requirement; however, banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. In order to refrain from restrictions on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments, banking institutions must maintain minimum ratios of (1) common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0 , which First Busey exceeded by bps as of September 30, 2024, (2) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5 , which First Busey exceeded by bps as of September 30, 2024, and (3) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 , which First Busey exceeded by bps as of September 30, 2024.

 Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges 
 Busey entered into derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair value of components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

million as of September 30, 2024, and million as of December 31, 2023, were designated as cash flow hedges. Busey entered into one million receive-fixed, pay-floating interest rate swap to reduce Busey s asset sensitivity (Prime Loan Swap). Duration was added to our loan portfolio by fixing a portion of floating prime-based loans. Interest rates had risen above their historical lows allowing Busey to lock in a portion of its loan portfolio to reduce asset sensitivity while creating a more stable margin in a volatile rate market. These hedges were determined to be highly effective during the period, and Busey expects its hedges to remain highly effective during the remaining terms of the swaps. Further, in 2024 Busey entered into million one year forward-starting SOFR-based receive-fixed pay-floating interest rate swap, with an effective date of March 5, 2025, to reduce Busey s asset sensitivity (SOFR Loan Swap). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest rate swap to hedge the risks of variability in cash flows for future interest payments attributable to changes in the 3-month CME Term SOFR benchmark interest rate on Busey s junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trusts (Debt Swap) matured.

 Risk Participation Agreements 
 To manage the credit risk exposure related to customer-facing swaps, Busey entered into risk participation agreements in conjunction with loan participation arrangements with other financial institutions.

 SCOPE OF DISCUSSION 
 The following discussion and analysis are intended to assist readers in understanding Busey s financial condition and results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in this Quarterly Report, as well as our 2023 Annual Report . 
 
 BUSINESS 
 First Busey Corporation is a 11.99 billion financial holding company headquartered in Champaign, Illinois. Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol BUSE. 
 Our three operating segments provide a full range of banking, wealth management, and payment technology solutions through our subsidiaries, Busey Bank and FirsTech, in Illinois; the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area; southwest Florida; and Indianapolis, Indiana. 
 
 Banking Center Markets 
 Busey Bank serves the Illinois banking market with 50 banking centers, including 21 located within central Illinois, 17 located within the suburban Chicago market, and 12 located within the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. Our Illinois markets feature several Fortune 1000 companies. Those organizations, coupled with large healthcare and higher education sectors, anchor the communities in which they are located and have provided a comparatively stable foundation for housing, employment, and small business. 
 Busey Bank has eight banking centers in Missouri. St. Louis, Missouri has a diverse economy with major employment sectors including health care, financial services, professional and business services, and retail. We have a total of 20 banking centers within the boundaries of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area, including branches in both Illinois and Missouri. 
 Busey Bank has three banking centers in southwest Florida, an area which has experienced strong population growth, job growth, and an expanded housing market, as well as the benefits of a tourism and winter resort economy. 
 Busey Bank has one banking center in the Indianapolis, Indiana area, which is the most populous city of Indiana with a diverse economy, due in part to it serving as the headquarters of many large corporations. 
 
 Busey's Conservative Banking Strategy 
 Busey s financial strength is built on a long-term conservative operating approach. The quality of our core deposit franchise is a critical value driver of our institution. Busey remains substantially core deposit 1 funded, with robust liquidity and significant market share in the communities we serve. As of September 30, 2024, our loan to deposit ratio was 78.5 and core deposits represented 96.5 of total deposits. Furthermore, we have sufficient on- and off-balance sheet liquidity to manage deposit fluctuations and the liquidity needs of our customers. 
 Our credit performance reflects our highly diversified, conservatively underwritten loan portfolio, which has been originated predominantly to established customers with tenured relationships with Busey. Our approach to lending and our underwriting standards are designed to emphasize relationship banking rather than transactional banking. In addition, as a matter of both policy and practice, we limit concentration exposures in any particular loan segment. As a result, asset quality remains strong by both Busey s historical and current industry trends. 
 
 1 Core deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis Non-GAAP Financial Information included in this Quarterly Report.

Table of Contents Contents of Item 2. MD A 

 Busey s conservative banking strategy is reflected in the strength of our capital base. We strive to consistently maintain capital ratios well in excess of thresholds required to be designated as well capitalized by applicable regulatory guidelines, thereby ensuring financial strength and flexibility across economic and operating cycles. At September 30, 2024, our leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets was 11.0 , our common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 13.8 , and our total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 18.2 . 
 
 Mergers and Acquisitions 
 CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. 
 On August 26, 2024, Busey and CrossFirst, a Kansas corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, CrossFirst will merge with and into Busey, with Busey as the surviving corporation in the merger (the Merger ). The Merger Agreement further provides that at a date and time following the Merger as determined by Busey, CrossFirst Bank, a Kansas state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of CrossFirst, will merge with and into Busey Bank, with Busey Bank as the surviving bank (the Bank Merger ). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each share of CrossFirst common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than certain shares held by CrossFirst or Busey, will be converted into the right to receive 0.6675 of a share of Busey common stock. Upon completion of the Merger, holders of Busey common stock Busey stockholders will own approximately 63.5 of the combined company and holders of CrossFirst common stock CrossFirst stockholders will own approximately 36.5 of the combined company, on a fully-diluted basis. 
 Completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Busey stockholders and CrossFirst stockholders and the requisite regulatory approvals for the Merger and the Bank Merger. With approvals, the parties expect to close the merger in the first or second quarter of 2025. In connection with the Merger, Busey incurred one-time pre-tax acquisition-related expenses of 1.3 million and 1.5 million during the three and nine months months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Merchants and Manufacturers Bank Corporation 
 Effective April 1, 2024, Busey completed its previously announced acquisition of M M, pursuant to which Busey acquired M M and its wholly-owned subsidiary, M M Bank, through a merger transaction. This partnership added M M s Life Equity Loan products to Busey s existing suite of services and expands Busey s presence in the suburban Chicago market. M M s results of operations were included in Busey s results of operation beginning April 1, 2024. 
 Busey operated M M Bank as a separate banking subsidiary of Busey until it was merged with Busey Bank on June 21, 2024. At the time of the bank merger, M M Bank s banking centers became banking centers of Busey Bank, except for M M s banking center located at 990 Essington Rd., Joliet, Illinois, which was closed in connection with the bank merger.

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets. 
 Certain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21.0 . Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.

 After raising federal funds rates by a total of 525 bps between March 2022 and July 2023, the FOMC lowered rates by 50 bps in September 2024. In anticipation of the FOMC pivot to an easing cycle, we limited our exposure to term funding structures and intentionally priced savings specials to encourage maturing CD balances to migrate to managed rate non-maturity products. During September we began lowering rates on special priced deposit accounts and other managed rate products to benefit from the FOMC rate cuts. In addition, approximately 6 of our deposit portfolio is indexed and immediately repriced with the rate cuts by the FOMC. Our short duration CD balances comprise only 15 of the deposit funding base, providing us the ability to quickly reprice the book at lower market rates. We continue to offer CD specials with shorter term structures as well as offering attractive premium savings rates to encourage rotation of maturing CD deposits into nimble pricing products. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we also saw the full benefit of the December 2023 and March 2024 targeted balance sheet repositionings in our net interest margin. 
 Net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and is presented in the table below for the periods indicated:

 Busey remains deliberate in our efforts to prudently manage expenses and expects to realize increased rates of M M acquisition synergies during the final quarter of 2024.

 Salaries, wages, and employee benefits were 44.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 12.4 increase from the comparable period in 2023, and were 130.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an 8.6 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Busey recorded 0.1 million and 1.3 million of non-operating expenses for salaries, wages, and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively; in comparison we did not record any non-operating expense in this category during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our total associate base consisted of 1,510 full-time equivalents as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1,484 at September 30, 2023. The increase in our associate-base was largely due to the M M acquisition. Current trends continue to reflect a competitive labor market, maintaining pressure on costs related to attracting and maintaining our skilled workforce. 
 Data processing expense was 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 16.5 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Excluding non-operating expenses, data processing expense was 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 15.0 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Data processing expense was 20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 17.7 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Excluding non-operating expenses, data processing expense was 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 14.6 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Increases were primarily attributable to Company-wide investments in technology enhancements, as well as inflation-driven price increases. 
 Combined, net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expense totaled 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.8 increase from the comparable period in 2023, and 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.7 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Primary cost drivers in these expense categories include lease costs, repairs and maintenance, depreciation expense, real estate taxes, and utilities. 
 Professional fees were 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 102.2 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Excluding non-operating expenses, professional fees were 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 19.4 increase from the comparable period in 2023, primarily as a result of increases in consulting fees and audit and accounting expenses. Professional fees were 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 72.0 increase from the comparable period in 2023. Excluding non-operating expenses, professional fees were 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 32.6 increase from the comparable period in 2023, primarily as a result of increases in consulting fees and legal costs. 
 Amortization of intangible assets was 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.3 decrease from the comparable period in 2023, and 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 4.6 decrease from the comparable period for 2023. Decreases were due to the use of an accelerated amortization methodology. 
 Interchange expense was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 24.3 decrease from the comparable period in 2023, and was 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 14.8 decrease from the comparable period in 2023. Fluctuations in interchange expense relate to payment and volume activity at FirsTech. 
 FDIC insurance expense was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 4.2 decrease from the comparable period in 2023, and 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 4.7 decrease from the comparable period in 2023.

 Other noninterest expense was 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 17.3 decrease from the comparable period in 2023, and was 28.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an 11.8 decrease from the comparable period in 2023. In connection with Busey s adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, Busey began recording amortization of New Markets Tax Credits as income tax expense instead of other noninterest expense, resulting in decreases in other noninterest expense of 2.3 million and 6.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Further changes in other noninterest expense are attributable to multiple items, including the provision for unfunded commitments, sales of other real estate owned, marketing, and business development expenses. 
 Efficiency Ratio 
 The efficiency ratio 2 , which is a measure commonly used by management and the banking industry, measures the amount of expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Our efficiency ratio was 62.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 62.4 for the same period in 2023, and was 60.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60.0 for the same period in 2023. 
 Our adjusted efficiency ratio 2 was 60.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 62.3 for the same period in 2023, and was 60.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60.0 for the same period in 2023. 
 Taxes 
 Our effective income tax rates of 24.8 and 26.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 28.0 due to tax exempt interest income, such as municipal bond interest and bank owned life insurance income. 
 Our effective tax rates increased in 2024 due to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 in January 2024. In addition, our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes an estimated one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment of 1.4 million resulting from a change to our Illinois apportionment rate due to recently enacted regulations. These new regulations are expected to lower our ongoing tax obligation in future periods, but created a negative adjustment to the carrying value of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2024. The table below presents our effective income tax rates and effective income tax rates excluding the one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment (dollars in thousands) : 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Income before income taxes 42,564 115,945 Income taxes 10,560 30,359 One-time deferred tax valuation adjustment resulting from a change to our Illinois apportionment rate due to recently enacted regulations 1,446 Income taxes, excluding one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment

 Portfolio Loans 
 We believe that making sound and profitable loans is a necessary and desirable means of employing funds available for investment. Busey maintains lending policies and procedures designed to focus lending efforts on the types, locations, and duration of loans most appropriate for its business model and markets. M M s policies were similar in nature to Busey Bank s policies, and we are migrating the legacy M M portfolio toward Busey Bank s policies. While not specifically limited, we attempt to focus our lending on short to intermediate-term (0-10 years) loans in geographic areas within 125 miles of our lending offices. Loans originated outside of these areas are generally to existing customers of Busey Bank. We attempt to utilize government-assisted lending programs, such as the SBA and U.S. Department of Agriculture lending programs, when prudent. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets, primarily real estate, and guaranteed by individuals. Loans are expected to be repaid primarily from cash flows of the borrowers or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 86 

Table of Contents Contents of Item 2. MD A 

 Management reviews and approves Busey Bank s lending policies and procedures on a regular basis. Management routinely at least once per quarter reviews the ACL in conjunction with reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans, and potential problem loans. Our underwriting standards are designed to encourage relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Relationship banking implies a primary banking relationship with the borrower that includes, at a minimum, an active deposit banking relationship in addition to the lending relationship. Significant underwriting factors, in addition to location, duration, a sound and profitable cash flow basis, and the borrower s character, include the quality of the borrower s financial history, the liquidity of the underlying collateral, and the reliability of the valuation of the underlying collateral. 
 At no time is a borrower s total borrowing relationship permitted to exceed Busey Bank s regulatory lending limit. We generally limit such relationships to amounts substantially less than the regulatory limit. Loans to related parties, including executive officers and directors of First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries, are reviewed for compliance with regulatory guidelines. 
 Busey maintains an independent loan review department that reviews loans for compliance with our loan policy on a periodic basis. In addition, the loan review department reviews risk assessments made by our credit department, lenders, and loan committees. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee at least quarterly. 
 Busey Bank s lending activities can be summarized into two primary categories: commercial and retail. Lending is further classified into five primary areas: commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, real estate construction loans, retail real estate loans, and retail other loans. A description of each of the five primary areas can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Portfolio Loans of Busey s 2023 Annual Report . 
 The composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated, as well as changes in portfolio loan balances, were as follows (dollars in thousands) :

 Portfolio loan growth in 2024 was due to the M M acquisition. As has been our practice, we remain steadfast in our conservative approach to underwriting and disciplined approach to pricing, particularly given our outlook for the economy in the coming quarters. This posture will continue to impact loan growth, which we expect to remain modest over the next several quarters.

 Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses 
 The ACL is a significant estimate in our unaudited consolidated financial statements, affecting both earnings and capital. The methodology adopted influences, and is influenced by, Busey Bank s overall credit risk management processes. The ACL is recorded in accordance with GAAP to provide an adequate reserve for expected credit losses that is reflective of management s best estimate of what is expected to be collected. Estimates of credit losses are based on a careful consideration of all significant factors affecting collectability as of the evaluation date. The ACL is established through the provision for credit losses expense charged to income. Provision expenses were recorded as follows for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands) : 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision for credit losses 2 364 7,317 1,944 
 The ACL and the ratio of ACL to portfolio loan balances is presented below by loan category and class, as of each of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands) :

 As of September 30, 2024, management believed the level of the ACL to be appropriate based upon the information available. However, additional losses may be identified in our loan portfolio as new information is obtained. The ongoing impacts of CECL will be dependent upon changes in economic conditions and forecasts, originated and acquired loan portfolio composition, prepayment speeds, credit performance trends, portfolio duration, and other factors. The September 30, 2024, ratio of ACL to portfolio loans was impacted by the acquisition of M M s Life Equity Loan portfolio, as Busey did not record an allowance for credit loss for these loans due to no expected credit loss at default, as permitted under the practical expedient provided within ASC 326-20-35-6. The Life Equity Loan portfolio balance was 285.6 million as of September 30, 2024, and is included in the retail other loan classification.

 Non-Performing Loans and Non-Performing Assets 
 Loans are considered past due if the required principal or interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory guidelines. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
 Typically, loans are secured by collateral. When a loan is classified as non-accrual and determined to be collateral dependent, it is appropriately reserved or charged down through the ACL to the fair value of our interest in the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio is collateralized primarily by real estate. 
 The following table sets forth information concerning non-performing loans and performing restructured loans, as of each of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands) :

 Asset quality remains strong both by Busey s historical trends and by current industry trends, and our operating mandate and focus have been on emphasizing credit quality over asset growth. 
 Non-performing loan balances increased to 8.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 7.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans represented 0.11 of portfolio loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.10 as of December 31, 2023. Our allowance for credit losses provided coverage of 10.34 times our non-performing loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.74 times at December 31, 2023. 
 Non-performing assets, which includes non-performing loans, OREO, and other repossessed assets, increased to 8.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 7.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets represented 0.07 of total assets as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.06 as of December 31, 2023. Our allowance for credit losses provided coverage of 10.26 times our non-performing assets at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.55 times at December 31, 2023. 
 Classified assets, which includes non-performing assets and substandard loans, increased to 89.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 72.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Classified assets represented 5.89 of Busey Bank s Tier 1 capital and ACL at September 30, 2024, compared to 4.97 at December 31, 2023. 
 Net charge-offs totaled 0.2 million and 15.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.3 million and 1.8 million for the comparable periods in 2023. Increases in net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were significantly attributable to a single C I credit relationship. 
 Asset quality metrics remain dependent upon market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period. If economic conditions were to deteriorate, we would expect the credit quality of our loan portfolio to decline and loan defaults to increase. 
 Potential Problem Loans 
 Potential problem loans are those classified as substandard that are not individually evaluated, non-accrual, or 90+ days past due, but where current information indicates that the borrower may not be able to comply with loan repayment terms. Management assesses the potential for loss on such loans and considers the effect of any potential loss in determining its provision for expected credit losses. Potential problem loans increased to 80.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 64.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Management continues to monitor these loans and anticipates that restructurings, guarantees, additional collateral, or other planned actions will result in full repayment of the debts. As of September 30, 2024, management identified no other loans that represent or result from trends or uncertainties which would be expected to materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources. 
 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits decreased by 3.4 to 9.94 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10.29 billion as of December 31, 2023. The quality of our core deposit 3 franchise coupled with cash flows from our securities portfolio allows us to fund loan growth while limiting our reliance on higher cost wholesale funding alternatives. We focus on deepening our relationships with customers to maintain and protect our strong core deposit franchise. As of September 30, 2024, our average customer tenure was 16.7 years for retail customers and 12.6 years for commercial customers. Core deposits include non-brokered transaction accounts, money market and savings deposit accounts, and time deposits of 250,000 or less. Core deposits represented 96.5 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to 96.2 as of December 31, 2023. Our estimated amount of uninsured deposits was 3.84 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.81 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 3 Core deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis Non-GAAP Financial Information included in this Quarterly Report.

 Liquidity 
 Liquidity management is the process by which we ensure that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the present and future cash flow obligations arising in the daily operations of our business. These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet commitments to borrowers for extensions of credit, fund capital expenditures, honor withdrawals by customers, pay dividends to stockholders, and pay operating expenses. Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, interest-bearing bank deposits, and federal funds sold. Balances of these assets are dependent on our operating, investing, lending, and financing activities during any given period. 
 Average liquid assets are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands) : 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average liquid assets Cash and due from banks 113,122 119,874 109,507 117,977 Interest-bearing bank deposits 389,005 132,856 371,472 119,393 Total average liquid assets 502,127 252,730 480,979 237,370 Average liquid assets as a percent of average total assets 4.2 2.1 4.0 1.9 
 Cash and unencumbered securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) : 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and unencumbered securities Total cash and cash equivalents 553,709 719,581 Debt securities available for sale 1,818,117 2,087,571 Debt securities available for sale pledged as collateral (697,109) (649,769) Cash and unencumbered securities 1,674,717 2,157,383 
 Busey s primary sources of funds consist of deposits, investment maturities and sales, loan principal repayments, and capital funds. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve, and our revolving credit facility, as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands) : 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Additional available borrowing capacity FHLB 2,007,087 1,898,737 Federal Reserve Bank 656,436 598,878 Federal funds purchased 477,500 482,500 Revolving credit facility 40,000 40,000 Additional borrowing capacity 3,181,023 3,020,115 
 Further, the company could utilize brokered deposits as additional sources of liquidity, as needed. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 93 

Table of Contents Contents of Item 2. MD A 

 As of September 30, 2024, management believed that adequate liquidity existed to meet all projected cash flow obligations. We seek to achieve a satisfactory degree of liquidity by actively managing both assets and liabilities. Asset management guides the proportion of liquid assets to total assets, while liability management monitors future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly. 
 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 Busey Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. The balance of commitments to extend credit represents future cash requirements and some of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. 
 The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments and reserves for unfunded commitments (dollars in thousands) : 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Outstanding loan commitments and standby letters of credit 2,540,339 2,176,496 Reserve for unfunded commitments 6,422 7,062 
 The following table summarizes our provision for unfunded commitments expenses (releases) for the periods presented (dollars in thousands) : 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision for unfunded commitments expense (release) 407 13 (640) (357) 
 We anticipate we will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments, including loan applications received and in process prior to the issuance of firm commitments. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Our capital ratios are in excess of those required to be considered well-capitalized pursuant to applicable regulatory guidelines. The Federal Reserve uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks. Risk-based capital ratios are established by allocating assets and certain off-balance-sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories. These balances are then multiplied by the factor appropriate for that risk-weighted category. In order to refrain from restrictions on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments, banking institutions must maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimum capital requirements. The table below presents minimum capital ratios that include the capital conservation buffer in comparison to the capital ratios for First Busey and Busey Bank as of September 30, 2024: 
 Minimum Capital Requirements with Capital Buffer As of September 30, 2024 First Busey Busey Bank Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets 7.00 13.78 16.17 Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets 8.50 14.65 16.17 Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets 10.50 18.19 17.13 Leverage Ratio of Tier 1 Capital to Average Assets 6.50 10.97 12.10

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 This Quarterly Report contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, together with the related GAAP financial measures, in analysis of Busey s performance and in making business decisions, as well as for comparison to Busey s peers. We believe the adjusted measures are useful for investors and management to understand the effects of certain non-core and non-recurring noninterest items and provide additional perspective on our performance over time. 
 Non-GAAP disclosures have inherent limitations and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the results reported in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Tax effected numbers included in these non-GAAP disclosures are based on estimated statutory rates and effective rates as appropriate. 
 A listing of Busey's non-GAAP financial measures and ratios are shown in the table below, together with the related GAAP financial measures.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to Busey s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. Forward-looking statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of Busey s management and on information currently available to management, are generally identifiable by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate, plan, intend, estimate, may, will, would, could, should, position, or other similar expressions. Additionally, all statements in this document, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and Busey undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events. 
 
 A number of factors, many of which are beyond Busey s ability to control or predict, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, the following: (1) risks related to the proposed transaction with CrossFirst, including (i) the possibility that the proposed transaction will not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, stockholder, or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all, or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated (and the risk that required regulatory approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction); (ii) the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction will not be realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Busey and CrossFirst do business; (iii) the possibility that the merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; (iv) diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; (v) the possibility that Busey may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in the merger within the expected timeframes or at all, and to successfully integrate CrossFirst's operations with those of Busey or that such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (vi) revenues following the proposed transaction may be lower than expected; and (vii) shareholder litigation that could prevent or delay the closing of the proposed transaction or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations; (2) the strength of the local, state, national, and international economy (including effects of inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints); (3) the economic impact of any future terrorist threats or attacks, widespread disease or pandemics, or other adverse external events that could cause economic deterioration or instability in credit markets (including Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East); (4) changes in state and federal laws, regulations, and governmental policies concerning Busey's general business (including changes in response to the failures of other banks or as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election); (5) changes in accounting policies and practices; (6) changes in interest rates and prepayment rates of Busey s assets (including the impact of sustained elevated interest rates); (7) increased competition in the financial services sector (including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions and fintech companies) and the inability to attract new customers; (8) changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; (9) the loss of key executives or associates; (10) changes in consumer spending; (11) unexpected results of other transactions (including the acquisition of M (12) unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation, investigations, or inquiries involving Busey (including with respect to Busey s Illinois franchise taxes); (13) fluctuations in the value of securities held in Busey s securities portfolio; (14) concentrations within Busey s loan portfolio (including commercial real estate loans), large loans to certain borrowers, and large deposits from certain clients; (15) the concentration of large deposits from certain clients who have balances above current FDIC insurance limits and may withdraw deposits to diversify their exposure; (16) the level of non-performing assets on Busey s balance sheets; (17) interruptions involving information technology and communications systems or third-party servicers; (18) breaches or failures of information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents; and (19) the economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, blizzards, and droughts. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Busey has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of its unaudited consolidated financial statements. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies of Busey s 2023 Annual Report . 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of Busey s financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective, or complex. These estimates involve judgments, assumptions, and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. Further, changes in accounting standards could impact our critical accounting estimates. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. The following accounting policies could be deemed critical: 
 
 Fair Value of Debt Securities Available for Sale 
 Fair values of debt securities available for sale are measurements from an independent pricing service and are based on observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the security s terms and conditions, among other things. Different fair value estimates could result from the use of different judgments and estimates to determine the fair values of securities. 
 Realized securities gains or losses are reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited) . The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 
 A debt security available for sale is impaired if the fair value of the security declines below its amortized cost basis. To determine the appropriate accounting, we must first determine if we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the fair value increases to at least the amortized cost basis. If either of those selling events is expected, we will write down the amortized cost basis of the security to its fair value. This is achieved by writing off any previously recorded allowance related to the debt security, if applicable, and recognizing any incremental impairment through earnings. If we do not intend to sell the security, nor believe it more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the fair value recovers to the amortized cost basis, we must determine whether any of the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit loss, or if it is entirely the result of noncredit factors. 
 We consider the following factors in assessing whether the decline is due to a credit loss: 
 Extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; 
 adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area (for example, changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset-backed debt security, in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors); 
 payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future; 
 failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and 
 any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 105 

Table of Contents Contents of Item 2. MD A 

 Impairment related to a credit loss must be measured using the discounted cash flow method. Credit loss recognition is limited to the fair value of the security. Impairment is recognized by establishing an allowance for the debt security through the provision for credit losses. Impairment related to noncredit factors is recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. 
 
 Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations 
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Fair values are determined based on the definition of fair value defined in ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination generally requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than other assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Acquired loans are within the scope of ASC Topic 326 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. However, the offset to record the allowance on acquired loans at the date of acquisition depends on whether or not the loan is classified as PCD. The allowance for PCD loans is recorded through a gross-up effect, while the allowance for acquired non-PCD loans is recorded through provision expense, consistent with originated loans. Thus, the determination of which loans are PCD and non-PCD can have a significant effect on the accounting for these loans. 
 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. Determining the fair value often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, we assess the potential for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Busey estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to federal and state tax jurisdictions. Estimated income tax expense is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited) . Accrued and deferred taxes, as reported in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) , represent the net estimated amount due to, or to be received from, taxing jurisdictions, either currently or in the future. Management judgment is involved in estimating accrued and deferred taxes, as it may be necessary to evaluate the risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, and taxable income calculations after considering tax-related statutes, regulations, and other relevant factors. Because of the complexity of tax laws and interpretations, interpretation is subject to judgment. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Busey calculates the ACL at each reporting date. We recognize an allowance for the lifetime expected credit losses for the amount we do not expect to collect. Measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported book value. The calculation also contemplates that Busey may not be able to make or obtain such forecasts for the entire life of the financial assets and requires a reversion to historical credit loss information. 
 In determining the ACL, management relies predominantly on a disciplined credit review and approval process that extends to the full range of Busey s credit exposure. The ACL must be determined on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. On a case-by-case basis, we may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on disparate risk characteristics. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 106 

Table of Contents Contents of Item 2. MD A 

 Loans deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the ACL. A provision for credit losses is charged to current expense and acts to replenish the ACL in order to maintain the ACL at a level that management deems adequate. 
 Determining the ACL involves significant judgments and assumptions by management. Macroeconomic forecasts provided by a third party are significant judgments used in determining the allowance. Significant downturns relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for an additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow for a reduction in the required allowance. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results may differ from these judgments and assumptions. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the risk of changes in asset values due to movements in underlying market rates and prices. Interest rate risk is a type of market risk to earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting Busey as other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, have minimal impact or do not arise in the normal course of Busey s business activities. 
 Busey has an asset-liability committee, whose policy is to meet at least quarterly, to review current market conditions and to structure the Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) to optimize stability in net interest income in consideration of projected future changes in interest rates. 
 As interest rate changes do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously, the asset-liability committee primarily relies on balance sheet and income simulation analysis to determine the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest income. In these standard simulation models, the balance sheet is projected over a one-year and a two-year time horizon and net interest income is calculated under current market rates and assuming permanent instantaneous shifts of +/-100, +/-200, +/-300, and +/-400 basis points. The model assumes immediate and sustained shifts in the federal funds rate and other market rate indices and corresponding shifts in other non-market rate indices based on their historical changes relative to changes in the federal funds rate and other market indices. Assets and liabilities are assumed to remain constant as of the measurement date; variable-rate assets and liabilities are repriced based on repricing frequency; and prepayment speeds on loans are projected for both declining and rising rate environments. 
 Busey s interest rate risk resulting from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates, expressed as a change in net interest income as a percentage of the net interest income calculated in the constant base model, was as follows: 
 Year-One: Basis Point Changes Year-Two: Basis Point Changes September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +400 8.50 7.38 10.69 8.55 +300 6.35 5.49 8.00 6.34 +200 4.21 3.64 5.33 4.20 +100 2.12 1.81 2.70 2.10 - 100 (1.99) (1.91) (3.50) (2.98) -200 (3.90) (3.86) (7.10) (6.12) -300 (5.55) (5.60) (10.87) (9.17) -400 (5.31) (6.91) (11.24) (11.36) 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 107 

Table of Contents 

 Interest rate risk is monitored and managed within approved policy limits and any temporary exceptions to policy in periods of rapid rate movement are approved and documented. The calculation of potential effects of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Actual results would likely differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, was carried out as of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and several other members of our senior management.

 RISKS RELATING TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER 
 The market price of Busey common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the shares of Busey common stock or CrossFirst common stock. 
 In the Merger, CrossFirst stockholders will become Busey stockholders. Busey s business differs from that of CrossFirst and certain adjustments may be made to Busey s business as a result of the Merger. Accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Busey common stock after the completion of the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of Busey. Changes in the operations and prospects of Busey, general market and economic conditions and other factors which may be beyond the control of Busey, and the market price of Busey common stock may alter the value of Busey or the prices of shares of Busey common stock by the time the Merger is completed. 
 Busey and CrossFirst are expected to incur substantial costs related to the Merger and integration. 
 Busey and CrossFirst have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, severance/employee benefit-related costs, public company filing fees and other regulatory fees, printing costs, and other related costs. 
 In addition, the combined company will incur integration costs following the completion of the Merger as Busey and CrossFirst integrate their businesses, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Busey and CrossFirst may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies, and systems that may need to be integrated, including accounting and finance, payroll, compliance, treasury management, branch operations, vendor management, risk management, lines of business, and benefits. While Busey and CrossFirst have assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs. Moreover, many of the costs that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration costs may result in the combined company taking charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. Anticipated pre-tax transaction costs for both CrossFirst and Busey combined are currently estimated to be approximately 75.3 million. 
 Combining Busey and CrossFirst may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. 
 The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Busey and CrossFirst. To realize the anticipated benefits from the Merger, Busey must successfully integrate CrossFirst into its existing businesses and, in particular, integrate CrossFirst into its risk management framework, compliance systems, and corporate culture, in a manner that permits the anticipated benefits to be realized and that does not materially disrupt existing client relationships or result in decreased revenues due to the loss of clients. If Busey is not able to successfully achieve these objectives for any reason, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual benefits of the Merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses. 
 An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses, and operating results of Busey following the completion of the Merger, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of Busey following the completion of the Merger. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 109 

Table of Contents 

 Busey and CrossFirst have operated and, until the effective time of the Merger, must continue to operate independently. 
 It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key CrossFirst employees, the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect each company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Busey and CrossFirst during this transition period and on Busey for an undetermined period after the completion of the Merger. 
 Busey s results following the Merger may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations. 
 Following the Merger, the size of the business of Busey will increase beyond its current size. Busey s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. Busey may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increased size of its business. There can be no assurances that Busey will be successful or that it will realize the expected benefits currently anticipated from the Merger. 
 Busey may be unable to retain Busey and/or CrossFirst personnel successfully after the Merger is completed. 
 The success of the Merger will depend in part on Busey s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by CrossFirst. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with CrossFirst while the Merger is pending or with Busey after the Merger. If Busey and CrossFirst are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, Busey and CrossFirst could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing clients, loss of key information, expertise, or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the Merger, if key employees terminate their employment, Busey s business activities may be adversely affected, and management s attention may be diverted from successfully hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause Busey s business to suffer. Busey and CrossFirst also may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company. 
 Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on Busey following the Merger. 
 Before the Merger and the Bank Merger may be completed, various approvals and consents must be obtained from the Federal Reserve, the DFPR, the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner (the KOSBC ), and other regulatory authorities in the United States. Busey submitted applications to the Federal Reserve, the DFPR, and the KOSBC in connection with the proposed Merger and the Bank Merger on or about September 23, 2024. 
 These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to (1) an adverse development in either party s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approvals; (2) governmental, political, or community group inquiries, investigations, or opposition; or (3) changes in legislation or the political environment generally. Additionally, over the past several years, mergers of banking organizations have encountered greater regulatory, governmental, and community scrutiny and have taken substantially longer to receive the necessary regulatory approvals and other required governmental clearances than in the past. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 110 

Table of Contents 

 The approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of Busey s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of Busey following the Merger, or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the Merger were consummated successfully within the expected time frame. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations, or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger. The completion of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods without the imposition of any material burdensome regulatory condition. Additionally, the completion of the Merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions, or decrees by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
 In addition, despite the parties commitments to using their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, neither Busey nor CrossFirst, nor any of their respective subsidiaries, is permitted (without the written consent of the other party) to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the required permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of governmental entities or regulatory agencies that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger and the Bank Merger. 
 The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed. 
 The Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: (1) approval by Busey stockholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and approval by CrossFirst stockholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therby; (2) authorization for listing on Nasdaq of the shares of Busey common stock to be issued in the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance; (3) the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve, the DFPR, and the KOSBC; (4) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S and (5) the absence of any order, injunction, decree, or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger, the Bank Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or making the completion of the Merger, the Bank Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement illegal. Each party s obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (1) subject to applicable materiality standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (2) the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, (3) the receipt by each party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (4) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to Busey or CrossFirst. 
 These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after the requisite stockholder approvals, or Busey or CrossFirst may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 111 

Table of Contents 

 Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact Busey. 
 If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Busey stockholders failing to approve the Busey merger proposal or CrossFirst stockholders failing to approve the CrossFirst merger proposal, there may be various adverse consequences, and Busey may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its clients, employees, and stockholders. For example, Busey s businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of Busey common stock could decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be beneficial and will be completed. Busey also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to proceedings commenced against CrossFirst to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Busey may be required to pay a termination fee of 36.7 million to CrossFirst. 
 Additionally, Busey has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing, and mailing a joint proxy statement/prospectus, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, Busey would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. 
 In connection with the Merger, Busey will assume CrossFirst s outstanding debt obligations, and Busey s level of indebtedness following the completion of the Merger could adversely affect Busey s ability to raise additional capital and to meet its obligations under its existing indebtedness. 
 In connection with the Merger, Busey will assume CrossFirst s outstanding indebtedness. Busey s existing debt, together with any future incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences for Busey s creditors and Busey s stockholders. For example, it could limit Busey s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes, and could require a significant portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on Busey s indebtedness, thereby reducing Busey s ability to use cash flows to fund its operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities. 
 Busey will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending. 
 Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and clients may have an adverse effect on Busey. These uncertainties may impair Busey s ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause clients and others that deal with Busey to seek to change existing business relationships with Busey. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Busey has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course in all material respects and to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on a timely basis without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent Busey from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. 
 The announcement of the proposed Merger could disrupt Busey s relationships with its clients, suppliers, business partners, and others, as well as its operating results and business generally. 
 Whether or not the Merger is ultimately consummated, as a result of uncertainty related to the proposed transactions, risks relating to the impact of the announcement of the Merger on Busey s business include the following: 
 its employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect Busey s ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees; 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 112 

Table of Contents 

 clients, suppliers, business partners, and other parties with which Busey maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about their respective futures and seek alternative relationships with third parties, seek to alter their business relationships with Busey, or fail to extend an existing relationship with Busey; and 
 Busey has each expended and will continue to expend significant costs, fees and expenses for professional services, and transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger. 
 If any of the aforementioned risks were to materialize, they could lead to significant costs which may impact each Busey s results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Merger Agreement limits Busey s abilities to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Busey or CrossFirst. 
 The Merger Agreement contains no shop covenants that restrict each of Busey s and CrossFirst s ability to directly or indirectly, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by Busey s and CrossFirst s respective board of directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or non-public information or data relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a 36.7 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, may discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Busey or CrossFirst from considering or proposing that acquisition. 
 Busey stockholders will have reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the consummation of the Merger and will exercise less influence over management. 
 Busey stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting Busey. When the Merger is completed, each Busey stockholder will become a holder of common stock of the combined company, with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than the holder s percentage ownership of Busey prior to the consummation of the Merger. Former CrossFirst stockholders as a group are estimated to own approximately thirty-six and one-half percent (36.5 of the fully diluted shares of the combined company immediately after the Merger, and current Busey stockholders, as a group, are estimated to own approximately sixty-three and one half percent (63.5 of the fully diluted shares of the combined company immediately after the Merger. 
 Issuance of shares of Busey common stock in connection with the Merger may adversely affect the market price of Busey common stock. 
 In connection with the payment of the merger consideration, Busey expects to issue shares of Busey common stock to CrossFirst stockholders. The issuance of these new shares of Busey common stock may result in fluctuations in the market price of Busey common stock, including a stock price decrease. 
 First Busey Corporation (BUSE) | 113 

Table of Contents 

 Stockholder or stockholder litigation could prevent or delay the completion of the merger or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of Busey. 
 Stockholders of Busey and/or stockholders of CrossFirst may file lawsuits against Busey, CrossFirst, and/or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the Merger. One of the conditions to the closing is that no order, injunction, or decree issued by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint preventing the consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting Busey or CrossFirst defendants from completing the Merger, the Bank Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the Merger and could result in significant costs to Busey and/or CrossFirst, including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers of each company. Busey may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any stockholder or stockholder lawsuits filed in connection with the Merger. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Busey and could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger.
