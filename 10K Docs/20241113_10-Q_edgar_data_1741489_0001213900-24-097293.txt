This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are not historical facts and involve

Organizational Overview 

Together with our wholly owned crew management
subsidiaries, we are a crewing and crew management company responsible for sourcing, recruitment, selection, deployment, scheduling, training,
and on-going management of seafarers. Our services also include administrative functions related to crew management services, including
payroll services, travel arrangements, and verifying the insurance coverage information of all onboarded seafarers. We benefit from over
65 years of the combined experience of Stavros Galanakis and. Konstantinos Galanakis in various value adding activities of the shipping
sector such as ship management, technical management, ship agency, crewing and crew management. 

Through the crew management platform developed
by our affiliate, Seatrix, our personnel are able to collaborate with many different cultures in many different time zones with ever rising
complexities, presenting a uniform service level to our principals, regardless of the point of origin of the crew. This innovation allows
us to hire junior operators, who after a short training procedure are able to serve our principals with high quality standards, helping
the Company be cost effective while maintaining the highest possible service level. 

We currently manage over 2,300 seafarers of ten
different nationalities who are aboard seven different ship types. 

We expanded our services by providing ship management
services when we acquired Ultra Ship Management from Stavros Galanakis and Konstantinos Galanakis for that purpose, which has received
its Det Norske Veritas AS approved Interim Document of Compliance provided under the authority granted by the Government of the Republic
of the Marshall Islands, and we have also employed specialized personnel. The Interim Document of Compliance is the license required for
a ship management company to start providing its services.

Known Trends, Demands, Commitments, Events
or Uncertainties Impacting Our Business 

The shipping industry is currently experiencing historical uncertainty
in sustainability logistics and daily operations as a result of the past COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, the war between Russia
and Ukraine and the Israel Conflict with Hamas. Additionally, shortages of crew members have also been created due to aging crew members
leaving the maritime business. As a result, competition in crew resources is becoming stiffer and more unpredictable resulting in higher
wage demands from crew members. These wage demands, accompanied by incentive compensation requested by crew members, are increasing vessel
operating expenses. The impact of global inflation has also added to these increases. Additionally, smaller contract durations are requested
and timely changes in ports, increasing the costs of changing crews and the costs and volume of such logistics. 

To address these issues, we are implementing short
and long-term strategies based on proactive scheduling and recruitment, with the help of our cloud-based system and intelligent metrics
that have been developed in-house to monitor the trends and fashions of the maritime industry. Our goal is to build new
pools of seafarers by accelerating promotions, cadetship programs, and the employment of more cadets onboard. These cadets are scheduled
to be promoted to junior officers in the near future, generating a new breed of officers to address the global shortage and maintain crews
at reasonable costs. We have also developed interactive screens through HTML5 links to communicate with seafarers and to keep crews updated,
monitor their welfare and provide better services to them. We also proceed to regular updates of our cloud-based system to elevate logistics
intelligence, allowing us to handle growth and recruitment volumes more efficiently. While we believe that these actions will help address
many of these issues, if we are unable to address these issues effectively, the shortage of crew members and significant increase in expenses
could have a materially adverse impact on our business. 

COVID-19 

The future outbreak of COVID-19 may negatively
impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which at such time continued to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including
the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern. On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared
a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020
the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a pandemic . The significant outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in
a widespread health crisis that adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide; similarly, the future outbreak of COVID-19
would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The future outbreak of the COVID-19 may
adversely affect our shipping industry related customers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

The risks associated with any future outbreak
of COVID-19 would adversely affect our revenues due to health concerns by patrons of the shipping industry and government restrictions
upon the airline and shipping industry. Risks related to a future epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could
negatively impact our results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis our business,
financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,
including future information that may emerge concerning the severity of such future epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions
taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of a future epidemic, pandemic, or other
health crisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

14 

Future Operations 

In order to meet business goals, we must (a) execute
efficiently our current business of crew management; and (b) continue to focus on new business development to acquire new agreements. 

In order to raise sufficient funds to implement
our business plan, we may have to find alternative sources of funds, from a public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans
from third parties (such as banks or other institutional lenders). Equity financing could result in additional dilution to then existing
shareholders. If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either the money that we raise from private placements, or possible alternative
sources, then we may be unable to continue to maintain, develop or expand our operations. 

We generated revenues of 1,792,066 and 1,785,535
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 reflecting increased revenues of 6,531. The 6,531 increase
came as a result of higher fees such as allotment and communication fees. We have a Net Profit of 234,322 for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2024, compared to a Net Loss of 189,223 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

During the previous year, we have undergone material
cost-saving efforts to improve the Company s profitability and increase its cash flow. For example, our professional fees have decreased
from 198,206 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 179,439, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, representing
a decrease of 9.5 . 

Our payroll is a material expense, which we focused
on during the last five financial quarters. Recent improvements lead to a decrease of Salaries from 1,179,882 for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, to 769,328 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 410,554 or 34.8 . 

Our goal is to continue improving
profitability over future quarters through targeted cost savings initiatives and revenue enhancement measures. Consistent with our
cost savings measures, on May 13, 2024, our Vice President Stavros Galanakis and our Chief Operating Technology Officer,
Christodoulos Tzoutzakis, have agreed to reduce their salaries from 5,000 per month to 2,000 per month. 

Results of Operations 

Revenues 

For the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024, and September 30, 2023, we generated 1,792,066 and 1,785,535 in total revenue, respectively, representing an increase in total
revenue of 6,531 between the two periods, or 0.4 . The increase in total revenue between these two periods is primarily due to an increase
in fees such as allotment and communication fees. 

For the three-month periods ended September 30,
2024, and September 30, 2023, we generated 645,223 and 551,836 in total revenue, respectively, representing an increase in total revenue
of 93,387 between the two periods, or 16.9 . The decrease in total revenue between these two periods is primarily due to an increase
in various revenue categories such allotment and communication fees and fees related to working clothes. 

15 

Operating Expenses 

For the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024, and September 30, 2023, we incurred 1,146,139 and 1,596,533, respectively, in total operating expenses, representing a decrease
in total operating expenses between the two periods of 318,554, or 28.8 . The decrease in operating expenses in 2024 is primarily due
to a decrease in salaries. 

For the three-month periods ended September 30,
2024, and September 30, 2023, we incurred 416,433 and 603,193, respectively, in total operating expenses, representing a decrease in
total operating expenses between the two periods of 450,395, or 28.2 . The decrease in operating expenses comes from a combination of
lower salaries, professional fees and other general costs. 

Net Loss and Gross Profit 

For the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024, and September 30, 2023, we incurred a net profit of 234,322 and a net loss of 189,223, respectively, representing an increase
in net profit of 423,545 between the two periods. This increase in net profit is attributable to the decreased operating expenses described
above, despite the gross profit decreasing by 23,039, or 1.6 , from 1,413,845 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, to
 1,390,807 for the same period in 2024. 

For the three-month periods ended September 30,
2024, and September 30, 2023, we incurred a net profit of 125,138 and a net loss of 54,547, respectively, representing an increase in
net profit of 179,685 between the two periods. This increase in net profit is attributable to the increased revenues and decreased operating
expenses described above. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate
adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working capital surplus during the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2024, of 436,658 compared to a surplus of 42,454 for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is calculated as current
assets minus current liabilities. 

Cash flows for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 

Net cash used in operating activities was 582,940
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to an outflow of 343,821 during the same period in 2023. This change was
mainly attributable to the material increase of Accounts Receivable and Other Receivables during the first nine months of 2024. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 10,466,
mainly deriving from the purchase of office equipment and software, and 8,162 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and
September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Net cash used for financing activities was 0
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

16 

Cash Requirements 

We believe our cash and cash equivalents, together
with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, and capital expenditure requirements for at
least the next twelve months. We will require additional capital to implement our business development and fund our operations. In the
event that our plans or assumptions change, we may need to raise additional capital sooner than expected. 

Since the commencement of our crew management
business, we have funded our operations primarily through equity financings. We expect that we will continue to fund our business through
equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances. Additional funding may be unavailable on favorable terms, if at
all, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results. We intend to continue to fund our business by way
of equity or debt financing along with revenues to support us. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible
debt securities, the percentage ownership held by our existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant
dilution. In addition, new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.

Outlook 

The shipping industry and especially the crew
management segments will continue to face increasing pressures due to the war in Ukraine. According to the International Chamber of Shipping
(the ICS ), which represents approximately 80 of the worlds merchant fleet, Ukrainian and Russian seafarers make
up 14.5 of the global shipping workforce. 

Our management team is assessing alternative plans
to mitigate potential challenges arising from the ongoing war in Ukraine, among other things. 

Lack of qualified seafarers has led to increased
competition among crewing and shipping companies not only revolving around retaining current crew members, but also involving the strategic
challenge of finding and attracting new, qualified seafarers. Traditional recruitment methods may no longer be as effective, and companies
will need to invest more resources in recruitment campaigns, including attending job fairs, forming partnerships with maritime academies,
and leveraging digital platforms for wider reach. However, this might intensify the financial pressure on crewing companies and lead to
thinner profitability margins. Ultimately, this underscores the importance of innovative recruitment and retention strategies in an era
of limited seafarer supply. 

Further to the above, the demand for our services
depends on the demand for maritime shipping services which are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy, including
the effect of increased inflation. Inflationary pressures may result to important increases to our operating costs that we may not be
able to fully transfer to our clients thus affecting our profitability. Additionally, increase in operating costs of our clients may lead
to delays in payments for our services and accumulation of bad debt, although we closely monitor their credit behavior to avoid such incidents.
Additionally, significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on the
demand for our services. 

The ongoing conflict in Israel may influence the
wider macroeconomic environment, but it is unlikely to substantially impact our operations, given that the majority of our seafarers are
not from the affected region and none of our clients are based there. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedure 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Framework used by Management to Evaluate
the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the related rule of the SEC, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using
the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
on this assessment and for the reasons described below, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective as of September 30, 2024. 

18 

Management s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines
internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that: 

Refer to the upkeep of records which, with reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements; 

Provide reasonable assurance that any unauthorized cash transactions are detected and prevented; and 

Provide reasonable assurance that potential erroneous accounting entries are identified and corrected on a timely manner. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design
of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

As required by the SEC Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b),
we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to material weaknesses in internal
controls over financial reporting (as described below). 

19 

Deficiencies and Significant Deficiencies 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB Audit Standard No. 5, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material
weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of September 30, 2024, our internal controls over financial reporting were
not effective at the reasonable assurance level: 

1. 
 We do not have sufficient written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the period ended September 30, 2024. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have sufficient written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2. 
 We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company s ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

We have taken steps to remediate some of the weaknesses
described above and we are in discussions with the risk advisory departments of reputable accounting firms to assist us in the COSO framework
documentation and testing of the internal controls. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit, including the
employment of new qualified employees. 

Remediation of Deficiencies and Significant
Deficiencies 

To address these material weaknesses, management
engaged financial consultants, performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein
fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Additionally, we will continue to establish and
implement proper processes and systems to remediate the deficiencies we have had, including preventive controls with the segregation of
duties on main areas such as payroll, billing, cash recording, and IT control and detective controls involving account reconciliations
on a monthly basis. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We know of no material, existing or pending legal
proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings
in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material
interest adverse to our interest. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As a Smaller Reporting Company, we are not required
to disclose risk factors. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 

None. 

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 

Risk management and strategy 

Our Company is committed to continuously assessing
cybersecurity risks, including the prevention, detection, and response to unauthorized actions within our information systems that may
compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our data or systems. We are using Layer 7 firewall solutions which monitor
all kind of web traffic and any kind of data leaks which may occur as well as a centralized automatic antivirus/antimalware/patch system
in order to make sure that all servers and clients hold the latest patches in order to avoid security breaches. The Company has developed
its own internal cloud system to avoid dependence on external parties and its email server is hosted on this cloud system therefore is
not relying to third party solutions that may have a negative impact on security and reliability of data. The Company s data are
stored daily on high quality magnetic tapes to ensure recovery in case of a serious malfunction. On a monthly basis, all the tapes are
being transferred to a fireproof safe location and are replaced with new tapes. 

As we grow, we plan to refine our cybersecurity
strategy in line with global best practices and standards. Importantly, our Board receives regular updates from our Chief
Operating Technology Officer, Christodoulos Tzoutzakis, regarding potential cybersecurity risks and monitors these risks closely.
All potential incidents, regardless of their materiality, are required to be reported immediately to the Board. To date, our proactive
risk management has allowed us to navigate cybersecurity challenges without material impairment to our operations or financial condition. 

Governance 

Acknowledging the critical importance of cybersecurity,
our management and Board are dedicated to maintaining the trust and confidence of our business partners and employees. This includes managing
cybersecurity risks as an integral component of our overall risk management framework. While cybersecurity responsibility is shared across
all employees, our Board plays a pivotal role in the oversight of our risk management processes, including cybersecurity threats. Our
executive officers manage the day-to-day material risks we face, adopting a cross-functional approach to address cybersecurity risks by
identifying, preventing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to incidents when they occur.
