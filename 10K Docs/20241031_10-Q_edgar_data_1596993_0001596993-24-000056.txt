On November 24, 2023, we entered into a shipbuilding contract for a newbuilding Very Large Gas Carrier / Ammonia Carrier VLGC/AC with a cargo carrying capacity of cbm that can transport LPG or ammonia and is expected to be delivered from Hanwha Ocean Co. Ltd. in the second calendar quarter of 2026. We provide in-house commercial management services for all of our vessels, including our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool (defined below), which may also receive commercial management services from MOL Energia (defined below). Excluding our time chartered-in vessels, we provide in-house technical management services for all of our vessels, including our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool. of our ECO-VLGCs, including of our time chartered-in ECO-VLGCs, are equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as scrubbers to reduce sulfur emissions and, as of September 30, 2024, we have a contractual commitment to fabricate a scrubber on our newbuilding VLGC/AC. Additionally, one of the chartered-in dual-fuel Panamax size VLGCs is equipped with a shaft generator, which generates additional electricity that can be used to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. On April 1, 2015, Dorian and MOL Energia Pte. Ltd. MOL Energia ), formerly known as Phoenix Tankers Pte. Ltd., began operations of Helios LPG Pool LLC (the Helios Pool ), which entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under variable rate time charters to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. Refer to Note 3 below for further description of the Helios Pool. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and related Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules for interim financial reporting.

 owned by Mr. John C. Hadjipateras, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries entered into an agreement with DHSA, retroactive to July 2014 and superseding an agreement between Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. and DHSA, for the provision by Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries of certain chartering and marine operation services to DHSA, for which income was earned and included in Other income-related parties totaling less than million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and less than million for both the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, there was nothing due from DHSA. Helios LPG Pool LLC On April 1, 2015, Dorian and MOL Energia began operations of the Helios Pool, which entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under variable rate time charters to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. We hold a interest in the Helios Pool as a joint venture with MOL Energia and all significant rights and obligations are equally shared by both parties. All profits of the Helios Pool are distributed to the pool participants based on pool points (see below for description of pool points) assigned to each vessel as variable charter hire and, as a result, there are no profits available to the equity investors as a share of equity. We have determined that the Helios Pool is a variable interest entity as it does not have sufficient equity at risk. We do not consolidate the Helios Pool because we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have a controlling financial interest. In consideration of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 810-10-50-4e, the significant factors considered and judgments made in determining that the power to direct the activities of the Helios Pool that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance are shared, in that all significant performance activities which relate to approval of pool policies and strategies related to pool customers and the marketing of the pool for the procurement of customers for the pool vessels, addition of new pool vessels and the

 members from each joint venture investor. Further, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 810-10-25-38D, the Company and MOL Energia are not related parties as defined in ASC 850 nor are they de facto agents pursuant to ASC 810-10, the power over the significant activities of the Helios Pool is shared, and no party is the primary beneficiary in the Helios Pool or has a controlling financial interest. As of September 30, 2024, the Helios Pool operated VLGCs, including vessels from our fleet (including vessels time chartered-in from unrelated parties) and MOL Energia vessels, and time chartered-in vessel. As of September 30, 2024, we had net receivables from the Helios Pool of million (net of amounts due to Helios Pool of million which are reflected under Due to related Parties ), including million of working capital contributed for the operation of our vessels in the pool. As of March 31, 2024, we had net receivables from the Helios Pool of million (net of an amount due to Helios Pool of million which are reflected under Due to related Parties ), including million of working capital contributed for the operation of our vessels in the pool. Our maximum exposure to losses from the pool as of September 30, 2024 is limited to the receivables from the pool. The Helios Pool does not have any third-party debt obligations. The Helios Pool has entered into commercial management agreements with each of Dorian LPG (DK) ApS and MOL Energia and has appointed both as the exclusive commercial managers of pool vessels. Fees for such services earned by Dorian LPG (DK) ApS are included in Other income-related parties in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations and were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and million for both the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we receive reimbursement of expenses such as costs for security guards, war risk insurance, and certain other voyage costs for vessels operating in the Helios Pool, for which we earned less than million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively and are included in Other revenues, net in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. Through our vessel owning subsidiaries, we have chartered vessels to the Helios Pool during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The time charter revenue from the Helios Pool is variable depending upon the net results of the pool, operating days and pool points for each vessel. The Helios Pool enters into voyage and time charters with external parties and receives freight and related revenue and, where applicable, incurs voyage costs such as bunkers, port costs and commissions. At the end of each month, the Helios Pool calculates net pool revenues using gross revenues, less voyage expenses of all pool vessels, less fixed time charter hire for any chartered-in vessels, less the general and administrative expenses of the pool as variable rate time charter hire for the relevant vessel to participants based on pool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, scrubber-equipped, fuel efficiency, fuel-type consumed, and speed are taken into consideration) and number of days the vessel participated in the pool in the period. In accordance with the pool participation agreements, pool points are finalized in arrears every six months ending September 30 and March 31 and pool profits are reallocated based on the actual recorded speed and consumption performance for each vessel operating in the Helios Pool during the preceding six-month period. Net pool revenues, less any amounts required for working capital of the Helios Pool, are distributed, to the extent they have been collected from third-party customers of the Helios Pool. We recognize net pool revenues on a monthly basis, when each relevant vessel has participated in the pool during the period and the amount of net pool revenues for the month can be estimated reliably. Revenue earned from the Helios Pool is presented in Note 12. Additions Amortization ) Balance, September 30, 2024

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSI S OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please also see the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements included in this quarterly report. Overview We are a Marshall Islands corporation headquartered in the United States and primarily focused on owning and operating VLGCs, each with a cargo-carrying capacity of greater than 80,000 cbm, in the LPG shipping industry. Our founding executives have managed vessels in the LPG shipping market since 2002. Our fleet currently consists of twenty-five VLGC carriers, including one dual-fuel 84,000 cbm ECO-design VLGC, or our Dual-fuel ECO VLGC; nineteen fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO-design VLGCs, or our ECO VLGCs; one 82,000 cbm modern VLGC; three time chartered-in dual fuel Panamax size VLGCs; and one time chartered-in ECO VLGC. The twenty-five VLGCs in our fleet, including the four time chartered-in vessels, as of October 25, 2024, have an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 2.1 million cbm and an average age of 7.9 years. On November 24, 2023, we entered into an agreement for a newbuilding VLGC/AC with a cargo carrying capacity of 93,000 cbm that can transport LPG or ammonia and is expected to be delivered from Hanwha Ocean Co. Ltd. in the second calendar quarter of 2026. Currently, sixteen of our ECO VLGCs, including one of our time chartered-in ECO-VLGCs, are fitted with exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as scrubbers to reduce sulfur emissions. We also have a contractual commitment to fabricate a scrubber on our newbuilding VLGC/AC. Vessels fitted with scrubbers allow us to reduce our emissions and to burn less refined fuel, which is frequently cheaper than more refined, lower sulfur grades. When the cost of more refined fuel exceeds that of less refined fuel, we are typically able to earn a higher TCE for spot voyages and to potentially contract time charters at higher rates compared to vessels without scrubbers. Additionally, one of the chartered-in dual-fuel Panamax size VLGCs is equipped with a shaft generator, which generates additional electricity that can be used to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. On April 1, 2015, Dorian and MOL Energia began operations of the Helios Pool, which entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under a variable rate time charter to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to contracts of affreightment, or COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. As of October 25, 2024, twenty-four of our twenty-five VLGCs were employed in the Helios Pool, including our four time chartered-in VLGCs. Our customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., China International United Petroleum Chemicals Co., Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell plc, Equinor ASA, Total S.A., and Sunoco LP, commodity traders such as Glencore plc, Itochu Corporation, Bayegan Group, Gunvor Group, and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., Indian Oil Corporation, SK Gas Co. Ltd., and Astomos Energy Corporation, or subsidiaries of the foregoing. We continue to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Currently, one of our VLGCs is on a fixed-rate time charter outside of the Helios Pool. See Our Fleet below for more information and the definition of Pool-TCO.

 Recent Development Appointment of Director On October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors, on the recommendation of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, unanimously authorized the increase in the size of the Board of Directors from seven to eight directors, and, to fill the resulting vacancy, appointed Mark Ross to serve as a Class III director, effective immediately. Mr. Ross had a distinguished 34-year career at Chevron Corporation, most recently serving as the president of Chevron Shipping Company. Dividend On October 24, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of 1.00 per share of the Company s common stock totaling 42.8 million.

The Baltic Exchange Liquid Petroleum Gas Index, an index published daily by the Baltic Exchange for the spot market rate for the benchmark Ras Tanura-Chiba route (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton), averaged 52.049 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an average of 121.007 during the six months ended September 30, 2023. Vessel Operating Expenses Vessel operating expenses were 19.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, or 10,114 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time-period for the technically-managed vessels that were in our fleet and decreased by 1.5 million, or 6.9 from 21.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.The decrease of 744 per vessel per calendar day, from 10,858 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 10,114 per vessel per calendar day for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of decreases per vessel per calendar day of 301 for spares and stores, 166 for lubricants, 116 for repairs and maintenance and 207 per vessel per calendar day for other vessel operating expenses. Excluding non-capitalizable drydock-related operating expenses, daily operating expenses decreased by 632 from 10,399 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 9,767 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.9 million, or 21.2 , from 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was driven by increases of 1.8 million in stock-based compensation, 0.7 million in cash bonuses, and 0.4 million in other general and administrative expenses.

 during this period was mainly due to a decrease of 0.9 million in loan interest on our long-term debt, which was driven by a decrease in average indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees, from 645.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 593.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest Income Interest income amounted to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.5 million is mainly attributable to higher average cash balances for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives Unrealized loss on derivatives amounted to 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 7.2 million unfavorable change is primarily attributable to (1) an unfavorable change of 7.1 million in the fair value of our interest rate swaps caused by changes in forward SOFR yield curves and changes in notional amounts, and (2) an unrealized loss on our FFA positions of less than 0.1 million. Results of Operations For the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 Revenues The following table compares our revenues for the six months ended September 30:

Operating Statistics and Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with U.S.GAAP, we present certain operating statistics and non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of our business performance. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA and time charter equivalent rate. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and revenues, which are the most directly comparable measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP measures in assessing the performance of our ongoing operations and in planning and forecasting future periods. These adjusted measures provide a more comparable basis to analyze operating results and earnings and are measures commonly used by shareholders to measure our performance. We believe that these adjusted measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our business results and assessing our prospects for future performance.

We believe that adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period and management makes business and resource-allocation decisions based on such comparisons. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of derivatives, interest and finance costs, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, and depreciation and amortization expense, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income/(loss) between periods. We believe that including adjusted EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in use and should not be considered an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income/(loss). Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be computed consistently with similarly titled measures of other companies and, therefore, might not be comparable with other companies. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) for the periods presented: 

Three months ended Six months ended (in U.S. dollars) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net income 9,428,605 76,512,665 60,716,745 128,233,802 Interest and finance costs 9,438,273 10,314,881 18,956,703 20,718,730 Unrealized (gain)/loss on derivatives 5,583,238 (1,560,594) 6,004,865 (4,419,868) Realized gain on interest rate swaps (1,667,809) (1,928,217) (3,385,058) (3,775,981) Stock-based compensation expense 5,998,722 4,179,798 7,274,181 4,956,405 Depreciation and amortization 17,370,662 17,045,919 34,541,648 33,701,236 Adjusted EBITDA 46,151,691 104,564,452 124,109,084 179,414,324 (2) We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was owned or operated pursuant to a bareboat charter. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period. (3) We define time chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we time chartered-in vessels from third parties excluding off-hire days. Time chartered-in days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of charter hire expenses that are recorded during that period. (4) We define available days as the sum of calendar days and time chartered-in days (collectively representing our commercially-managed vessels) less aggregate off hire days associated with both unscheduled and scheduled maintenance, which include major repairs, drydockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. We use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues. Note that we have updated our definition of available days to include unscheduled maintenance as we believe it is more reflective of industry practice and more consistent with the practice used in the Helios Pool, which now accounts for more than 95 of our revenue.

 (5) Prior period amounts have been updated to conform to current period presentation. (6) Time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, is a non-U.S. GAAP measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period to period changes in a shipping company s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (such as time charters, voyage charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods and is a factor in management s business decisions and is useful to investors in understanding our underlying performance and business trends. Our method of calculating TCE rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by available days for the relevant time period, which may not be calculated the same by other companies. Note that we have updated the denominator of our calculation of TCE to be our updated definition of available days (see note 4 above) as we believe it is more reflective of industry practice and more consistent with the practice used in the Helios Pool, which now accounts for more than 95 of our revenue. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of revenues to TCE rate (unaudited) for the periods presented:

Prior period amounts have been updated to conform to current period presentation of available days (see footnotes to tables above). (7) Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business is capital intensive, and our future success depends on our ability to maintain a high - quality fleet. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 348.6 million and restricted cash of 0.9 million. Our primary sources of capital during the six months ended September 30, 2024 were (i) the net cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in June 2024 amounted to approximately 84.4 million, net of underwriting discounts and commission, and legal and other offering costs, and (ii) 98.6 million in cash generated from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of our long-term debt, net of deferred financing fees of 4.7 million, was 579.0 million including 53.8 million of principal on our long-term debt scheduled to be repaid within the next twelve months. Operating expenses, including expenses to maintain the quality of our vessels in order to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, the funding of working capital requirements, long-term debt repayments, financing costs, commitments for the building of a VLGC/AC, the fabrication and installation of scrubber, and drydocking represent our short-term, medium-term and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate satisfying our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months with cash on hand, cash from operations and, if needed, drawdowns on the revolving credit facility available under the 2023 A R Debt Facility. We may also seek additional liquidity through alternative sources of debt financings and/or through equity 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 financings by way of private or public offerings. However, if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our short-term liquidity needs, or to satisfy our future medium-term or long-term liquidity needs, we may need to seek alternative sources of financing and/or modifications of our existing credit facility and financing arrangements. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing or modifications to our existing credit facility and financing arrangements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. On June 7, 2024, we issued 2 million shares to the public at a price of 44.50 per share with proceeds totaling 89.0 million, less (i) 2.225 per share, or 4.5 million, of underwriting discounts and commissions, and (ii) 0.1 million of legal and other offering costs. On February 2, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of our common shares (the 2022 Common Share Repurchase Authority ). Under this authorization, when in force, purchases were and may be made at our discretion in the form of open market repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or a combination of these methods. The actual amount and timing of share repurchases are subject to capital availability, our determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of our shareholders, and market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, our total purchases under the 2022 Common Share Repurchase Authority totaled 75,000 shares for an aggregate consideration of 1.8 million. No repurchases under the 2022 Common Share Repurchase Authority were made during the six months ended September 30, 2024. We are not obligated to make any common share repurchases. On April 25, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of 1.00 per share of our common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 8, 2024, totaling 40.6 million. We paid 40.4 million on May 29, 2024, with the remaining 0.2 million deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest. On July 24, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of 1.00 per share of the Company s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 8, 2024, totaling 42.8 million. We paid 42.6 million on August 21, 2024, with the remaining 0.2 million deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest. On August 5, 2024, we paid 1.1 million of dividends that had been deferred until the vesting of certain restricted stock. On October 24, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of 1.00 per share of the Company s common stock totaling 42.8 million. The dividend is payable on or about November 25, 2024 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 5, 2024. These were irregular dividends. All declarations of dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of our Board of Directors based on its consideration of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, anticipated capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, restrictions under applicable law, our business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend policy will also impact our future liquidity position. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. As part of our growth strategy, we will continue to consider strategic opportunities, including the acquisition or charter-in of additional vessels. We may choose to pursue such opportunities through internal growth, joint ventures, business acquisitions, or other transactions. We expect to finance the purchase price of any future acquisitions either through internally generated funds, public or private debt financings, public or private issuances of additional equity securities or a combination of these forms of financing.

 Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by/(used in) operating, financing and investing activities for the six months ended September 30: 

September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 98,558,859 163,567,062 Net cash used in investing activities (1,030,260) (9,357,508) Net cash used in financing activities (30,607,995) (110,781,950) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 66,910,835 43,244,997 Operating Cash Flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 98.6 million, compared to 163.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash generated from operations of 65.0 million is primarily related to reduced operating income . Net cash flow from operating activities depends upon our overall profitability, spot market rates for vessels employed on voyage charters and in the Helios Pool, charter rates agreed to for time charters, the timing and amount of payments for drydocking expenditures and unscheduled repairs and maintenance, fluctuations in working capital balances and bunker costs. Investing Cash Flows. Net cash used in investing activities was 1.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash used in investing activities of 9.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was comprised of 2.8 million of payments for vessels under construction and vessel capital expenditures, partially offset by a 1.8 million maturity of available-for-sale debt securities. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was comprised of 7.3 million of capital expenditure payments for vessel capital expenditures and 2.0 million in purchases of investment securities. Financing Cash Flows. Net cash used in financing activities was 30.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net cash used in financing activities of 110.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities consisted of (i) dividend payments of 84.0 million; (ii) repayments of long-term debt of 26.7 million; and (iii) payments to repurchase common stock of 4.3 million; partially offset by 84.4 million of net proceeds from an issuance of common shares 89.0 million of gross proceeds less offering costs paid of 4.6 million). For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of (i) dividend payments of 81.6 million; (ii) repayments of long-term debt of 26.5 million; and (iii) payments to repurchase common stock of 2.7 million. Capital Expenditures. LPG transportation is a capital intensive business, requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance. We are generally required to complete a special survey for a vessel once every five years. Drydocking of vessels occurs every five years unless an extension is granted by the classification society to seven and one-half years and the vessel is not older than 15 years of age. Intermediate surveys are performed every two and one-half years after every special survey. Drydocking each vessel takes approximately 15 to 25 days. We spend significant amounts for scheduled drydocking (including the cost of classification society surveys) for each of our vessels. As our vessels age and our fleet expands, our drydocking expenses will increase. We estimate the current cash outlay for a VLGC special survey to be approximately 1.2 million per vessel (excluding any capital improvements, such as scrubbers, ballast water management systems, energy saving devices, and performance improvement additions to the vessel that may be made during such drydockings) and the cost of an intermediate survey to be between 150,000 and 250,000 per vessel. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of our drydocking and classification society survey costs. In order to comply with current emissions regulations, we have installed scrubbers on fifteen of our vessels and have one chartered-in scrubber-equipped vessel, which allows us to burn heavy 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 fuel oil. Our other non-dual fuel vessels currently consume compliant fuels on board (0.5 sulfur), which are readily available globally, but at a significantly higher cost. We have entered into a contract to fabricate a scrubber for installation on our newbuilding VLGC/AC with remaining commitments on this contract totaling 1.0 million as of September 30, 2024. We also have one newbuilding Dual-fuel ECO VLGC and three chartered-in dual-fuel vessels that have the capability to burn LPG as fuel, which we believe may provide an economic benefit over traditional fuel. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Company We may incur increasing costs for the drydocking, maintenance or replacement of our vessels as they age, and, as our vessels age, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. On November 24, 2023, we entered into an agreement for a newbuilding VLGC/AC with a cargo carrying capacity of 93,000 cbm that can transport LPG or ammonia, which is expected to be delivered from Hanwha Ocean Co. Ltd. in the second calendar quarter of 2026. As of September 30, 2024 we had approximately 98.4 million of commitments under the newbuilding contracts outstanding that we expect to settle during certain milestones through the expected delivery of the vessel. Debt Obligations For information relating to our secured term loan facilities and Japanese financing arrangements, refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 and Note 7 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for September 30, 2024 included herein. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates The following is an update to the Critical Accounting Estimates set forth in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. Impairment of long-lived assets. We review our vessels for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In addition, we compare independent appraisals to our carrying value for indicators of impairment to our vessels. When such indicators are present, an asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated future undiscounted net operating cash flows. The impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset. The new lower cost basis would result in a lower annual depreciation than before the impairment. Our estimates of fair market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on information available from various industry sources, including: reports by industry analysts and data providers that focus on our industry and related dynamics affecting vessel values; news and industry reports of similar vessel sales; approximate market values for our vessels or similar vessels that we have received from shipbrokers, whether solicited or unsolicited, or that shipbrokers have generally disseminated; offers that we may have received from potential purchasers of our vessels; and 

 28 

Table of Contents 
 vessel sale prices and values of which we are aware through both formal and informal communications with shipowners, shipbrokers, industry analysts and various other shipping industry participants and observers. As we obtain information from various industry and other sources, our estimates of fair market value are inherently uncertain. In addition, vessel values are highly volatile; as such, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future fair market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them. As of September 30, 2024, independent appraisals of our technically-managed VLGCs in our fleet had no indications of impairment on any of our VLGCs in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment. No impairment charges were recognized for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE S ABOUT MARKET RISK For additional discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. Interest Rate Risk The LPG shipping industry is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of investment. Much of this investment is provided in the form of long-term debt. One of our debt agreements, as described in Note 7 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, contains interest rates that fluctuate with SOFR. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge exposure to fluctuations of interest rate risk associated with that debt financing agreement and have hedged 156.0 million of amortizing principal under the 2023 A R Debt Facility as of September 30, 2024 (corresponding to 80 of the outstanding indebtedness under that agreement) and thus increasing interest rates could adversely impact our future earnings due to additional interest expense on the unhedged portion of that debt. For the 12 months following September 30, 2024, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 20 basis points in the underlying SOFR rates would result in an increase or decrease of our interest expense on all of our non-hedged interest-bearing debt by 0.1 million assuming all other variables are held constant. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only a level of reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
