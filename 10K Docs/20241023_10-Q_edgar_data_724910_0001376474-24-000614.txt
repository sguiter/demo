Total marketable securities represented approximately 77 of our total assets as of September 30, 2024. Marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, had remaining maturities between one and 55 months. 
 
 Money market funds are included on the balance sheets in Cash and cash equivalents. Corporate bonds are included on the balance sheets in Marketable securities, short term and Marketable securities, long term. Accrued interest receivables were as of September 30, 2024, and as of March 31, 2024, and are included in the balance sheets in Prepaid expenses and other assets. 
 
 We monitor the credit ratings of our marketable securities at least quarterly as reported by Standard Poor s. The following table summarizes the fair values of our marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, aggregated by credit rating:

None of the securities were impaired at acquisition, and subsequent declines in fair value are attributable to interest rate increases. We do not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell, these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The issuers continue to make timely interest payments on these securities. Because we believe it is more likely than not we will recover the cost basis of our investments, we did not record any impairment attributable to credit losses. 
 
 None of the marketable securities purchased during the period had experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since its origination and were therefore not considered Purchased Financial Assets with Credit Deterioration.

Total revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the second quarter of fiscal 2025) decreased 5 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (the second quarter of fiscal 2024). The decrease was due to a 14 decrease in product sales, partially offset by a 3,950 increase in contract research and development revenue. The decrease in product sales was due to decreased purchases by existing customers. The increase in contract research and development revenue was due to a major research and development contract completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Gross margin percentage for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 86 , compared to 78 the prior-year quarter. The increase in gross margin percentage was due to a more profitable product mix and a larger portion of direct rather than distributor sales. 
 
 Total expenses increased 55 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a 24 increase in research and development expense, a 31 increase in selling, general, and administrative expense and a 202,926 recovery of credit losses in the prior-year quarter. The increase in research and development expense was due to increased new product development activities. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities. 
 
 Interest income for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 9 due to lower yields on recently purchased marketable securities. 
 
 Our effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 17 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 8 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The lower tax rate for the prior-year quarter was due to a 202,926 credit loss recovery and changes in the timing and amounts of federal tax credits and deductions. 
 
 The 15 decrease in net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year quarter was primarily due to decreased revenue, increased operating expenses, decreased interest income, and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by increased gross profit margin.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 3,096,179 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10,283,550 as of March 31, 2024. The 7,187,371 decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the first half of fiscal 2025 was due to 5,505,577 of cash used in investing activities and 9,667,381 of net cash used in financing activities, partially offset by 7,985,587 in net cash provided by operating activities. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities related to product sales and research and development contract revenue was our primary source of working capital for the current and prior-year quarters. 
 
 Accounts receivable decreased 192,402 during the first six months of fiscal 2025 primarily due to decreased revenue and the timing of customer payments. Inventories increased 259,026 primarily due to our decision to increase raw material and finished goods inventories in anticipation of a semiconductor industry recovery. Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased 156,116 primarily due to decreased bond interest receivable and prepayments for raw materials. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased 106,018 primarily due to decreased accrual for performance-based compensation. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used by investing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of 6,580,140 of marketable securities purchases and 1,125,437 of fixed asset purchases, partially offset by 2,200,000 in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. Fixed asset purchases consisted of a 1,125,437 downpayment on production equipment expected to be delivered in fiscal 2026. We plan to significantly increase fixed asset purchases in fiscal 2025 and 2026 compared to fiscal 2024 to support increases in production capacity and new product development. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisted of 9,667,352 of cash dividends paid to shareholders. 
 
 In addition to cash dividends to shareholders paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, on October 23, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a cash dividend of 1.00 per share of Common Stock, or 4,834,020 based on shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024, to be paid on November 29, 2024. 
 
 We plan to fund dividends through cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. All future dividends will be subject to Board approval and subject to the company s results of operations, cash and marketable security balances, estimates of future cash requirements, and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Furthermore, dividends may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
