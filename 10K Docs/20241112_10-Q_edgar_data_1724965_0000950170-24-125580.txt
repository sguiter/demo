Table of Contents 

 our ongoing strategy with respect to our Zama asset; 

uncertainty regarding our future operating results and our future revenues and expenses; 

impact of new accounting pronouncements on earnings in future periods; 

the Company s expectations with regard to the Rights Agreement (as defined herein); and 

plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this Quarterly Report that are not historical. 

We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility; global demand for oil and natural gas; the ability or willingness of OPEC and other state-controlled oil companies OPEC Plus to set and maintain oil production levels and the impact of any such actions; the lack of a resolution to the war in Ukraine and increasing hostilities in Israel and the Middle East, and their impact on commodity markets; the impact of any pandemic, and governmental measures related thereto; lack of transportation and storage capacity as a result of oversupply, government and regulations; lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services; adverse weather events, including tropical storms, hurricanes, winter storms and loop currents; cybersecurity threats; inflation and the impact of central bank policy in response thereto; environmental risks; failure to find, acquire or gain access to other discoveries and prospects or to successfully develop and produce from our current discoveries and prospects; geologic risk; drilling and other operating risks; well control risk; regulatory changes, including the impact of financial assurance requirements; changes in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences; the uncertainty inherent in estimating reserves and in projecting future rates of production; cash flow and access to capital; the timing of development expenditures; potential adverse reactions or competitive responses to our acquisitions and other transactions; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of acquired assets and operations; and the other risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of Talos Energy Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as applicable, with such amendments thereto as were made on November 12, 2024 on Form 10-K/A (the 2023 Annual Report ). 
 Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify upward or downward revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. 
 Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described herein occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report.

 . The Parent Company conducts all business operations through its operating subsidiaries, owns no operating assets and has no material operations, cash flows or liabilities independent of its subsidiaries. The Parent Company s common stock is traded on The New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TALO. The Parent Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively Talos or the Company is a technically driven independent exploration and production company focused on safely and efficiently maximizing long-term value through its operations, currently in the United States U.S. and offshore Mexico. The Company leverages decades of technical and offshore operational expertise towards the acquisition, exploration and development of assets in key geological trends that are present in many offshore basins around the world. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in complete financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which unless otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, cash flows and changes in equity for the periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. The unaudited financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in the 2023 Annual Report. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 operating segments: (i) exploration and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs Upstream Segment and (ii) CCS CCS Segment ), of which the Company s only reportable segment was the Upstream Segment. Subsequent to the TLCS Divestiture (as defined herein) and sale of the Company s entire CCS business, the Company had one operating segment. See additional information in Note 14 Segment Information . 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company has provided a discussion of its significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report.

Allocated purchase price 

The fair values determined for accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and most current liabilities were generally equivalent to the carrying value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of proved oil and natural gas properties as of the acquisition date is based on estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and related discounted future net cash flows incorporating market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation include estimates of future production volumes, future operating, development and plugging and abandonment costs, future commodity prices, and a weighted average cost of capital discount rate. When estimating the fair value of proved and unproved properties, additional risk adjustments were applied to proved developed non-producing, proved undeveloped and probable reserves to reflect the relative uncertainty of each reserve class.

Bank Credit Facility matures March 2027 

The carrying value of the senior notes are adjusted for discount, premium and deferred financing costs. Fair value is estimated (representing a Level 1 fair value measurement) using quoted secondary market trading prices and, where such prices are not available, other observable (Level 2) inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar liabilities in the active market. The carrying amount of the Company s bank credit facility, as amended and restated (the Bank Credit Facility ), is presented net of deferred financing costs. The fair value of the Bank Credit Facility is estimated based on the outstanding borrowings since it is secured by the Company s reserves and the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates (representing a Level 2 fair value measurement). Oil and Natural Gas Derivatives The Company attempts to mitigate a portion of its commodity price risk and stabilize cash flows associated with sales of oil and natural gas production. The Company is currently utilizing oil and natural gas swaps, costless collars and put options. Swaps are contracts where the Company either receives or pays depending on whether the oil or natural gas floating market price is above or below the contracted fixed price. Costless collars consist of a purchased put option and a sold call option with no net premiums paid to or received from counterparties. Typical collar contracts require payments by the Company if the NYMEX average closing price is above the ceiling price or payments to the Company if the NYMEX average closing price is below the floor price two-way collar ). Put options give the owner the right but not the obligation, to sell the underlying commodity at a specified price (i.e. strike price) within a specific period. Certain of the Company s put options have a deferred premium, which is included in the fair market value of the commodity derivatives. For the deferred premium puts, the Company agrees to pay a premium to the counterparty at the time of settlement. At settlement, if the applicable index price is below the strike price of the put, the Company receives the difference between the strike price and the applicable index price multiplied by the contract volumes less the premium. If the applicable index price settles at or above the strike price of the put, the Company pays only the premium at settlement.

The Company reflects such costs as Other operating (income) expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Although it is reasonably possible that the Company could receive state or federal decommissioning orders in the future or be notified of defaulting third parties in existing leases, the Company cannot predict with certainty, if, how or when such orders or notices will be resolved or estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from such orders. However, the Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its opinion regarding the outcome of certain notices or matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. Registration Rights Agreement In connection with the Company s entry into the QuarterNorth Merger Agreement, on March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the QNE Registration Rights Agreement with certain stockholders of QuarterNorth listed on Schedule A attached thereto (collectively, the RRA Holders ). Pursuant to the QNE Registration Rights Agreement, the Company granted the RRA Holders certain demand, piggy-back and shelf registration rights with respect to the shares of the Company s common stock received in connection with the QuarterNorth Acquisition, subject to certain customary thresholds and conditions. The Company is obligated to pay certain expenses of the RRA Holders incurred in connection with the exercise of their rights under the QNE Registration Rights Agreement and indemnify them for certain securities law matters in connection with any registration statement filed pursuant thereto. 

 operating segments: (i) Upstream Segment and (ii) CCS Segment. The CCS Segment was divested in March 2024. The Upstream Segment was the Company s only reportable segment. The QuarterNorth Acquisition did not change the Company s reportable segment determinations and is included in the Upstream Segment. Currently, the Company s CODM is the Interim Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire company. A reportable segment is an operating segment that meets materiality thresholds. The 10 tests, as prescribed by the segment reporting accounting guidance, are based on the reported measures of revenue, profit, and assets that are used by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources. The profit or loss metric used to evaluate segment performance is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined by the Company as net income (loss) plus interest expense; income tax expense (benefit); depreciation, depletion, and amortization; accretion expense; non-cash write-down of oil and natural gas properties; transaction and other (income) expenses; decommissioning obligations; the net change in the fair value of derivatives (mark to market effect, net of cash settlements and premiums related to these derivatives); (gain) loss on debt extinguishment; non-cash write-down of other well equipment; and non-cash equity-based compensation expense.

In addition, one Right will automatically attach to each share of Common Stock issued between the Record Date and the Distribution Date (as defined below). The Rights will initially trade with, and will be inseparable from, the Common Stock. The Rights will accompany any new shares of Common Stock issued after the Record Date until the earlier of the distribution date, the redemption date or the expiration date of the Rights. Each Right initially entitles the registered holder, subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value per share Preferred Shares ), for , subject to adjustment under certain conditions (the Purchase Price ). The Rights will become exercisable if (among other things) any person or group acquires or more of the outstanding Common Stock, including through derivatives agreements, without the approval of the Board (an Acquiring Person ). If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights except the Acquiring Person or any associate or affiliate thereof may, upon exercise of a Right, purchase for the Purchase Price shares of Common Stock with a market value of two times the Purchase Price, based on the market price of the Common Stock prior to such acquisition. If the Company is acquired in a merger or similar transaction after an Acquiring Person becomes such, all holders of Rights except the Acquiring Person or any associate or affiliate thereof may, upon exercise of a Right, purchase for the Purchase Price shares of the acquiring company with a market value of two times the Purchase Price, based on the market price of the acquiring company s stock prior to such transaction. Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person will be void and may not be exercised. per Right at any time before the earlier of the expiration date and the first date of public announcement that any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person. The Board adopted the Rights Agreement to protect the Company and deter any future efforts by any person or group to acquire actual, de facto or negative control of the Company without appropriately compensating its stockholders for that control or on terms that are inconsistent with the best interests of its stockholders. In general terms, the Rights Agreement imposes significant dilution upon any person or group that acquires or more of the outstanding Common Stock, including through certain derivatives agreements, without the approval of the Board. The terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement as it may be amended or restated from time to time.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation s 
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report to us, we, our, Talos or the Company are to Talos Energy Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report, as well as our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in our 2023 Annual Report and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Our Business 
 We are a technically driven independent exploration and production company focused on safely and efficiently maximizing long-term value through our operations, currently in the United States U.S. and offshore Mexico. We leverage decades of technical and offshore operational expertise towards the acquisition, exploration and development of assets in key geological trends that are present in many offshore basins around the world. 
 We have historically focused our oil and gas exploration and production operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico because of our deep experience and technical expertise in the basin, which maintains favorable geologic and economic conditions, including multiple reservoir formations, comprehensive geologic and geophysical databases, extensive infrastructure and an attractive and robust asset acquisition market. Additionally, we have access to state-of-the-art three-dimensional seismic data, some of which is aided by new and enhanced reprocessing techniques that have not been previously applied to our current acreage position. We use our broad regional seismic database and our reprocessing efforts to generate a large and expanding inventory of high-quality prospects, which we believe greatly improves our development and exploration success. The application of our extensive seismic database, coupled with our ability to effectively reprocess this seismic data, allows us to both optimize our organic drilling program and better evaluate a wide range of business development opportunities, including acquisitions and collaborative arrangement opportunities, among others. 
 In order to determine the most attractive returns for our drilling program, we employ a disciplined portfolio management approach to stochastically evaluate all of our drilling prospects, whether they are generated organically from our existing acreage, an acquisition or joint venture opportunities. We add to and reevaluate our inventory in order to deploy capital as efficiently as possible. 
 From January 1, 2024 through March 18, 2024, we had two operating segments: (i) exploration and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs Upstream Segment and (ii) CCS CCS Segment ), of which the Company s only reportable segment was the Upstream Segment. On March 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement relating to and subsequently completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, Talos Low Carbon Solutions LLC to TotalEnergies E P USA, Inc. (the TLCS Divestiture ). Subsequent to the TLCS Divestiture and our sale of the entire CCS business, we had one operating segment. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 14 Segment Information for additional information on our business segments and Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information on the TLCS Divestiture. 
 Significant Developments 
 The following significant developments have occurred since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, with the SEC on August 8, 2024. 
 Limited Duration Stockholder Rights Agreement On October 1, 2024, our Board of Directors (the Board adopted a stockholder rights agreement (the Rights Agreement and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock ), which became payable on October 11, 2024. The Board adopted the Rights Agreement to deter any future efforts by one person or a group to acquire actual, de facto or negative control of the Company through open market accumulation, or other tactics potentially disadvantaging the interests of all stockholders, without paying all stockholders an appropriate control premium or providing the Company's Board sufficient time to make informed decisions in the best interest of all stockholders. In general terms, the Rights Agreement imposes significant dilution upon any person or group that acquires 25 or more of the outstanding Common Stock, including through certain derivatives agreements, without the approval of the Board (an Acquiring Person ). The Rights Agreement is not intended to deter offers that are fair and otherwise in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, and does not prevent the Board from considering any proposal. In adopting the Rights Agreement, the Board noted, in particular, the continued accumulation of approximately 24 of shares of Talos common stock by Control Empresarial de Capitales S.A. de C.V. Control Empresarial ). The Rights Agreement is similar to those adopted by other publicly traded companies and is intended to enable all Talos stockholders to realize the long-term value of their investment and protect Talos from any future efforts to obtain control of the Company that are inconsistent with the best interests of its stockholders. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 15 Subsequent Events for more information on the Rights Agreement and Item 1. Financial Statements Note 12 Related Party Transactions for additional information on Control Empresarial. 
 The Rights Agreement is filed as Exhibit 4.11 to this Quarterly Report. This description of the Rights Agreement in this Quarterly Report does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 4.11.

 Chief Executive Officer Transition On August 29, 2024, Timothy S. Duncan departed his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective immediately. The Company also announced that Joseph A. Mills will serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer and President, effective as of August 29, 2024. The Board is working to identify a permanent Chief Executive Officer and has retained an executive search firm to assist in the process. 
 Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following items affect the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations for periods presented herein and could potentially continue to affect our future financial condition and results of operations. 
 QuarterNorth Acquisition On March 4, 2024, we acquired QuarterNorth Energy Inc. QuarterNorth ), a private operator in the Deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico (the QuarterNorth Acquisition ). See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for more information. 
 EnVen Acquisition On February 13, 2023, we acquired EnVen Energy Corporation EnVen ), a private operator in the Deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico (the EnVen Acquisition ). See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for more information. 
 Third Party Planned Downtime Since our operations are offshore, we are vulnerable to third party downtime events impacting the transportation, gathering and processing of production. For example, we produce the Phoenix Field through the Helix Producer I HP-I that is operated by Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. Helix ). Helix is required to disconnect and dry-dock the HP-I every two to three years for inspection as required by the U.S. Coast Guard, during which time we are unable to produce the Phoenix Field. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, Helix dry-docked the HP-I. After conducting sea trials, production resumed in mid-June, resulting in a total shut-in period of 52 days. The shut-in resulted in an estimated deferred production of approximately 1.6 MBoepd for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 based on production rates prior to the shut-in. 
 Known Trends and Uncertainties 
 See Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report for a detailed discussion of known trends and uncertainties. The following carries forward or provides an update to known trends and uncertainties discussed in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Volatility in Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are subject to wide fluctuations in supply and demand. Our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth depends upon the price we receive for our sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production. 
 During the period January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the daily spot prices for NYMEX WTI crude oil ranged from a high of 87.69 per Bbl to a low of 66.73 per Bbl, and the daily spot prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of 13.20 per MMBtu to a low of 1.25 per MMBtu. The price the Company realizes on natural gas sales is based on the MMBtu content of such natural gas. We convert MMBtu sales volumes to Mcf volumes for reporting purposes using MMBtu per Mcf factors per third party natural gas processing plant statements . Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices we realize for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of production. We hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5 Financial Instruments for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions as of September 30, 2024. 
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA published its October 2024 Short-Term Energy Outlook on October 8, 2024. Oil prices fell in September as concerns over global oil demand growth outweighed declines in oil inventories and a decision made by OPEC Plus to delay production increases until December 2024. However, oil prices rose in early October after recent military actions involving Israel, Lebanon, and Iran. The potential for further escalation creates significant uncertainty, increasing the possibility for supply disruptions and price volatility. The EIA expects the NYMEX WTI spot prices to average 71.97 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 73.13 per barrel in 2025. The EIA expects the Henry Hub price to continue rising to around 2.80 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2024 and to further increase to around 3.10 per MMBtu on average in 2025 as liquefied natural gas exports, a component of total natural gas demand, increase with the addition of capacity. 
 Inflation of Cost of Goods, Services and Personnel Due to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry, fluctuating demand for oilfield goods and services can put pressure on the pricing structure within our industry. As commodity prices rise, the cost of oilfield goods and services generally also increases, while during periods of commodity price declines, oilfield costs typically lag and do not adjust downward as fast as oil prices. Sustained levels of high inflation may also result in increases to the costs of our oilfield goods, services and personnel, which would in turn cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Inflation may also result in higher interest rates, which could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either or both of which could hurt our business.

Table of Contents 

 The U.S. inflation rate began increasing in 2021, peaked in the middle of 2022 and began to gradually decline in the second half of 2022. Sustained levels of high inflation generally cause the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed and other central banks to increase interest rates. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to curb inflation. The Fed wants inflation to return to its 2 goal over time and it is still high in absolute terms. The Fed has lowered its benchmark interest rate twice since September 2024 by an aggregate 75 basis points to a new range of 4.50 -4.75 from its 23-year high of 5.25 to 5.50 . Future changes to the benchmark interest rate remain uncertain. 
 Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties Under the full cost method of accounting, the ceiling test under SEC rules and regulations specifies that evaluated and unevaluated properties capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes (the Full Cost Pool ), should be compared to a formulaic limitation (the Ceiling each quarter on a country-by-country basis. If the Full Cost Pool exceeds the Ceiling, an impairment must be recorded. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize an impairment based on the ceiling test computations. At September 30, 2024 our ceiling test computation was based on SEC pricing of 80.66 per Bbl of oil, 2.32 per Mcf of natural gas and 19.06 per Bbl of NGLs. 
 If the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity price for crude oil or natural gas for the period beginning October 1, 2023 and ending September 1, 2024 used in the determination of the SEC pricing was 10 lower, resulting in 72.77 per Bbl of oil, 2.10 per Mcf of natural gas and 17.15 per Bbl of NGLs, while all other factors remained constant, our oil and natural gas properties would have been impaired by 293.0 million. 
 There is a significant degree of uncertainty with the assumptions used to estimate the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves due to, but not limited to the risk factors referred to in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Annual Report. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the Ceiling calculation. Any decrease in SEC pricing or increase in capital or operating costs could negatively impact the estimated future discounted net cash flows related to our proved oil and natural gas properties. 
 BOEM Bonding Rule On April 15, 2024, BOEM issued its final rule, entitled Risk Management and Financial Assurance for OCS Lease and Grant Obligations, which significantly increases the amount of new supplemental financial assurance required from lessees and grant holders conducting operations on the U.S. federal outer continental shelf OCS ). The final rule replaces the prior five-point test in determining whether an OCS lessee or grant holder is required to obtain supplemental financial assurance and instead requires lessees to meet one of two criteria based on: (1) the credit rating of the lessee or (2) the ratio of the value of proved oil and gas reserves of the lease to the estimated decommissioning liability associated with the reserves. As a result of the new rule, BOEM will no longer consider or rely upon the financial strength of predecessors in determining whether, or how much, supplemental financial assurance will be required by current lessees and grant holders. The final rule, which became effective on June 29, 2024, adopts a three-year phased compliance period for full payment of a supplemental financial assurance demand. Per BOEM s June 28, 2024 news release, BOEM anticipates it will take up to 24 months to complete the processing of financial assurance demands for execution. The final rule was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana by multiple oil and gas industry groups and the States of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas on June 17, 2024. Although implementation of the rule is not currently stayed, the outcome of these challenges remain uncertain. 
 As discussed in our 2023 Annual Report, including under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and the Oil and Natural Gas Industry, we may be unable to provide the financial assurances in the amounts and under the time periods required by the new rule. If we are unable to comply with these requirements, the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties, including assessing civil penalties, commencing proceedings to suspend our production and other operations or canceling our affected federal offshore leases. In addition, as a result of continuing adverse developments in restructurings and bankruptcies of companies operating in the OCS, a number of bonding companies have left the offshore surety market over the last twelve months, which has materially reduced the availability of surety bonds for projects in the OCS. As a result, there may not be sufficient surety bonds capacity available for companies in the OCS to comply with the new financial assurances rule. Our inability to obtain adequate supplemental financial assurance in order to comply with BOEM s final rule, including the future cost of compliance with respect to supplemental bonding, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, business, properties, liquidity and results of operations. 
 Deepwater Operations We have interests in Deepwater fields in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Operations in Deepwater can result in increased operational risks as has been demonstrated by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Despite technological advances since this disaster, liabilities for environmental losses, personal injury and loss of life and significant regulatory fines in the event of a disaster could be well in excess of insured amounts and result in significant current losses on our statements of operations as well as going concern issues. 
 Oil Spill Response Plan We maintain a Regional Oil Spill Response Plan that defines our response requirements, procedures and remediation plans in the event we have an oil spill. Oil spill response plans are generally approved by the BSEE biennially, except when changes are required, in which case revised plans are required to be submitted for approval at the time changes are made. Additionally, these plans are tested and drills are conducted periodically at all levels.

 Hurricanes, Tropical Storms and Loop Currents Since our operations are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we are particularly vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes, tropical storms and loop currents on production and capital projects. Significant impacts could include reductions and/or deferrals of future production and revenues and increased lease operating expenses for evacuations and repairs. 
 Five-Year Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Program Update Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act OCSLA ), as amended, BOEM prepares and maintains forward-looking five-year plans referred to by BOEM as national programs or five-year programs to schedule proposed oil and gas lease sales on the OCS. As previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, we were the high bidder on thirteen offshore Gulf of Mexico blocks related to Lease Sale 261 held by BOEM and awarded four leases. Subsequently, we were awarded leases on our remaining high-bid blocks. Additionally, QuarterNorth was the high bidder on four offshore blocks related to Lease Sale 261 and they were also awarded leases on all of their high-bid blocks. 
 The 2024-2029 national program began on July 1, 2024, and will continue through June 30, 2029. It is possible, however, that this program could be delayed by opposing lawsuits that were filed on February 12, 2024 by the American Petroleum Institute and Earthjustice representing multiple environmental groups, both of which are challenging BOEM s actions. Despite these challenges, on April 1, 2024, BOEM announced the availability of the Area Identification for proposed Gulf of Mexico lease sales 262, 263 and 264 pursuant to the 2024-2029 national program. Lease Sale 262 is tentatively scheduled for 2025. 
 Endangered Species On August 19, 2024, a U.S. District Court in Maryland ruled in favor of a coalition of environmental groups that, in 2020, filed suit against the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS ), claiming that NMFS s 2020 Biological Opinion, along with its associated reasonable and prudent alternative and incidental take statement, covering all activities associated with the OCS oil and gas program in the Gulf of Mexico, did not comply with the Endangered Species Act ESA or the Administrative Procedure Act. In her ruling, the Maryland District Court Judge vacated the 2020 Biological Opinion effective December 20, 2024. On September 16, 2024, NMFS filed a motion to alter or amend the Maryland District Court s August 19, 2024 judgment and order requiring vacatur of the 2020 Biological Opinion by December 20, 2024, stating that it is unable to issue a new Biological Opinion by that date. On October 21, 2024, the Maryland District Court extended the vacatur deadline until May 21, 2025, which NMFS believes provides sufficient time to prepare and issue a new Biological Opinion. Further, industry groups appealed the Maryland District Court s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The outcome of that challenge remains uncertain. Although NMFS intends to prepare a new Biological Opinion in advance of the May 2025 deadline, any revised Biological Opinion that NMFS issues may face similar scrutiny as the 2020 Biological Opinion and may also be subject to legal challenge. Without an active OCS Gulf of Mexico oil and gas program Biological Opinion in place, all permits, plans and government actions would likely require individual project-specific ESA consultations between BOEM or BSEE (as applicable) and NMFS, which due to significant delay could adversely impact our ability to obtain plans, permits and government approvals required for our Gulf of Mexico operations until a new Biological Opinion is issued by NMFS. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and the Oil and Natural Gas Industry Our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations as well as legal requirements applicable to marine life and endangered and threatened species of our 2023 Annual Report for additional information regarding the potential risks of these regulatory developments to our operations.

Table of Contents 

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Volumetric Analysis Production volumes increased by 32.8 MBoepd to 96.5 MBoepd. The increase was primarily due to 26.2 MBoepd of production from the oil and natural gas assets acquired in the QuarterNorth Acquisition that closed in early March 2024. Additionally, there was 9.5 MBoepd production from our operated Venice and Lime Rock wells, which tie back to our Ram Powell facility, which commenced initial production late in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as 2.9 MBoepd production from the recompletion of one of our operated Brutus wells, which commenced initial production in July 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 4.2 MBoepd of production due to disruptions from weather events in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, there was a decrease of approximately 2.7 MBoepd due to well performance and natural production declines. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Volumetric Analysis Production volumes increased by 24.7 MBoepd to 90.5 MBoepd. The increase was primarily due to 20.6 MBoepd in production from the oil and natural gas assets acquired in the QuarterNorth Acquisition that closed in early March 2024 as well as 2.1 MBoepd from the EnVen Acquisition that closed mid-first quarter of 2023. Additionally, production volumes increased 10.0 MBoepd production from the Venice and Lime Rock wells, which tie back to our Ram Powell facility, which commenced initial production late in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 5.0 MBoepd due to well performance and natural production declines as well as 1.4 MBoepd due to disruptions from weather events in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we deferred approximately 1.6 MBoepd of production resulting from third party downtime associated with the HP-I dry-dock in our Phoenix Field.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Lease operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 59.8 million, or 58 . This increase was primarily related to lease operating expenses of 63.8 million incurred in connection with assets acquired in the QuarterNorth Acquisition. Included in the increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is 33.1 million in facility and well workover expenses at the Gunflint Field. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Lease operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 169.8 million, or 59 . This increase was related to lease operating expenses of 116.7 million incurred in connection with assets acquired in the QuarterNorth Acquisition as well as a 10.1 million increase in lease operating expenses due to the EnVen Acquisition that closed in mid-first quarter 2023. 
 The increase in lease operating expense related to the QuarterNorth Acquisition included a 33.4 million increase in facility and well workover expenses at the Gunflint Field. 
 Additionally, there was a 54.2 million increase in facility and workover expense primarily related to the HP-I and major well workover expenses at the Phoenix Field and the Garden Banks 506 Field associated with our historical operations. The increase attributable to our historical operations was partially offset by 14.7 million in lower marine and helicopter transportation costs, commodity transportation costs and contract labor.

Additionally, the depletion rate increased by 3.11 per Boe, or 11 , on our proved oil and natural gas properties. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 268.5 million, or 56 . This was due to an increase of 3.54 per Boe, or 13 , in the depletion rate on our proved oil and natural gas properties due to our amortization base increasing disproportionately to the increase in our reserve base. Our amortization base increased primarily due to the proved properties acquired as part of the QuarterNorth Acquisition, which is further discussed in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 17.0 million, or 68 . This increase was primarily due to an increase in contractor and payroll expenses due to an increase in employee headcount primarily related to the QuarterNorth Acquisition. Additionally, there was an increase related to Upstream Segment transaction costs, severance costs and additional general and administrative expenses related to the QuarterNorth Acquisition of 3.1 million or 0.35 per Boe as well as an increase in non-cash equity-based compensation of 2.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the CCS Segment expenses of 2.5 million due to the TLCS Divestiture. Additionally, Upstream Segment transaction costs for the EnVen Acquisition decreased 1.5 million or 0.26 per Boe. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further discussion. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 38.7 million, or 32 . This increase was primarily related to the Upstream Segment transaction costs, severance costs and additional general and administrative expenses related to the QuarterNorth Acquisition of 45.2 million or 2.84 per Boe. Unallocated corporate reflects an increase in transaction costs and severance costs of 8.4 million related to the TLCS Divestiture. Additionally, there was an increase in contractor and payroll expenses due to an increase in employee headcount primarily related to the QuarterNorth Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Upstream Segment transaction costs for the EnVen Acquisition of 39.7 million or 2.21 per Boe. Additionally, the CCS Segment expenses decreased by 6.3 million due to the TLCS Divestiture. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further discussion.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Accretion Expense During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 29.4 million of accretion expense compared to 21.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily the result of a 4.6 million increase in accretion associated with the asset retirement obligations assumed as part of the QuarterNorth Acquisition. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures. 
 Other Operating (Income) Expense During the three months ended September 30, 2024, other operating (income) expense primarily reflects an incremental 13.5 million gain on the TLCS Divestiture due to the recognition of contingent consideration as well as a 7.0 million increase in fair value of a service credit acquired via the QuarterNorth Acquisition . During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of 66.2 million related to the deconsolidation of Talos Mexico (as defined below) partially offset by 8.0 million of estimated decommissioning obligations primarily as a result of unrelated third parties or counterparties that were unable to perform the required abandonment obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency.

Table of Contents 

 Price Risk Management Activities The income of 126.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consists of 120.2 million in non-cash gains from the increase in the fair value of our open derivative contracts and 6.1 million in cash settlement gains. The expense of 98.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consists of 92.5 million in non-cash losses from the decrease in the fair value of our open derivative contracts and 6.3 million in cash settlement losses. 
 These unrealized gains or losses on open derivative contracts relate to production for future periods; however, changes in the fair value of all of our open derivative contracts are recorded as a gain or loss on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations at the end of each reporting period. As a result of the derivative contracts we have on our anticipated production volumes through December 2025, we expect these activities to continue to impact net income (loss) based on fluctuations in market prices for oil and natural gas. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5 Financial Instruments . 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 18.1 million of income tax expense compared to 15.9 million of income tax benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax expense recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to current year activity offset by the impact from permanent differences. See additional information on the valuation allowance as described in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 10 Income Taxes . 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Accretion Expense During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 87.1 million of accretion expense compared to 63.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily the result of the increase in accretion associated with the asset retirement obligations assumed as part of both the EnVen Acquisition and QuarterNorth Acquisition and upward revisions of our asset retirement obligations. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures. 
 Other Operating (Income) Expense During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 100.4 million on the TLCS Divestiture. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further discussion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of 66.2 million related to the deconsolidation of Talos Mexico partially offset by 9.5 million of estimated decommissioning obligations primarily as a result of unrelated third parties or counterparties that were unable to perform the required abandonment obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 Interest Expense During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 146.1 million of interest expense compared to 128.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily the result of an increase in debt outstanding offset by a lower rate of interest on these instruments. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 7 Debt for more information. Additionally, there was an increase of 4.9 million of fees associated with the unutilized bridge loan. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for more information. 
 Price Risk Management Activities The income of 41.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists of 56.5 million in non-cash gains from the increase in the fair value of our open derivative contracts offset by 14.9 million in cash settlement losses. The expense of 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consists of 3.2 million in non-cash losses from the decrease in the fair value of our open derivative contracts and 10.5 million in cash settlement losses. 
 Equity Method Investment (Income) Expense During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded equity losses of 9.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an 8.6 million gain on the funding of the capital carry of our investment in Bayou Bend CCS LLC Bayou Bend by Chevron U.S.A. Inc. Chevron offset by equity losses of 5.6 million. 
 Other (Income) Expense During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 60.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the redemption of the 12.00 Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the 12.00 Notes and 11.75 Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2026 (the 11.75 Notes ). See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 7 Debt for more information. 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 4.4 million of income tax benefit compared to 55.5 million of income tax benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax benefit is primarily due to current year activity offset by the impact from permanent differences and a non-cash income tax benefit recognized in the Company s state deferred tax liability. See additional information on the valuation allowance as described in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 10 Income Taxes .

 Supplemental Non-GAAP Measure 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used to provide management and investors with (i) additional information to evaluate, with certain adjustments, items required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our debt agreements, (ii) important supplemental indicators of the operational performance of our business, (iii) additional criteria for evaluating our performance relative to our peers and (iv) supplemental information to investors about certain material non-cash and/or other items that may not continue at the same level in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP or as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 We define these as the following: 
 EBITDA Net income (loss) plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization, and accretion expense. 

Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA plus non-cash write-down of oil and natural gas properties, transaction and other (income) expenses, decommissioning obligations, the net change in the fair value of derivatives (mark to market effect, net of cash settlements and premiums related to these derivatives), (gain) loss on debt extinguishment, non-cash write-down of other well equipment and non-cash equity-based compensation expense. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):

(1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, transaction expenses include 4.7 million in severance expense related to the departure of the Company s former President and Chief Executive Officer as discussed in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 9 Employee Benefits Plans and Share-Based Compensation . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, transaction expenses include 38.8 million in costs related to the QuarterNorth Acquisition, inclusive of 22.3 million in severance expense, and 8.4 million in costs related to the TLCS Divestiture, inclusive of a net 2.9 million in severance expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, transaction expenses included 1.5 million and 39.4 million, respectively, in costs related to the EnVen Acquisition, inclusive of 0.9 million and 24.9 million, respectively, in severance expense. See further discussion in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 9 Employee Benefits Plans and Share-Based Compensation. Other income (expense) includes other miscellaneous income and expenses that we do not view as a meaningful indicator of our operating performance. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, it includes a gain of 13.5 million and 100.4 million related to the TLCS Divestiture, respectively. See further discussion in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures. Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, it includes a gain of 7.0 million and 9.5 million, respectively, related to an increase in fair value of a service credit acquired via the QuarterNorth Acquisition. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount includes a 66.2 million gain related to the deconsolidation of Talos Energy Mexico 7, S. de R.L. de C.V. Talos Mexico ). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount includes a gain on the funding of the capital carry of our investment in Bayou Bend by Chevron of 8.6 million. 

(2) Estimated decommissioning obligations were a result of working interest partners or counterparties of divestiture transactions that were unable to perform the required abandonment obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on decommissioning obligations. 

(3) The adjustments for the derivative fair value (gains) losses and net cash receipts (payments) on settled commodity derivative instruments have the effect of adjusting net loss for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, which are recognized at the end of each accounting period because we do not designate commodity derivative instruments as accounting hedges. This results in reflecting commodity derivative gains and losses within Adjusted EBITDA on an unrealized basis during the period the derivatives settled.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by our operations and borrowings under our Bank Credit Facility (as defined herein). Our primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures, working capital, debt service, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes. The cost of borrowings under our Bank Credit Facility has increased. By raising its federal funds rate, the Fed made it more expensive to borrow money. As of September 30, 2024, our available liquidity (cash plus available capacity under the Bank Credit Facility) was 842.9 million. 
 We fund our development and exploration activities primarily through operating cash flows, cash on hand and through borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility, if necessary. Historically, we have funded significant acquisitions with the issuance of senior notes, borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility and through equity issuances. We adjust our capital budget in response to changing operating cash flow forecasts and market conditions, including the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, acquisition opportunities and the results of our exploration and development activities. 
 Our liquidity could be impacted in the future by financial assurance requirements. See Known Trends and Uncertainties BOEM Bonding Rule. 
 Capital Expenditures The following is a table of our capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

(1) Asset management consists of capital expenditures for development-related activities primarily associated with recompletions and improvements to our facilities and infrastructure. 

(2) Settlement of decommissioning obligations as a result of working interest partners or counterparties of divestiture transactions that were unable to perform the required abandonment obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies . 

Based on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flows from operations, combined with availability under the Bank Credit Facility, provide sufficient liquidity to fund the remaining portion of our 2024 Upstream capital spending program of 510.0 million to 530.0 million and plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations of 100.0 million to 110.0 million. However, our ability to (i) generate sufficient cash flows from operations, (ii) obtain future borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility, and (iii) repay or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all for any potential future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions, depends on various operating and economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control. To the extent possible, we have attempted to mitigate certain of these risks (e.g., by entering into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to reduce the financial impact of downward commodity price movements on a substantial portion of our anticipated production), but we could be required to take additional future actions on an opportunistic basis. To address further changes in the financial or commodity markets, future actions may include, without limitation, issuing debt, including secured debt, or issuing equity to directly or independently repurchase or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. 
 Common Stock Repurchase Program Our Board authorized a stock repurchase program on March 20, 2023 with an approved limit of 100.0 million and no set term limits. In July 2024, our Board authorized an increase of 150.0 million to the previously approved limit increasing the amount remaining under the authorized plan to 159.7 million. All repurchased shares are held in treasury. The 1 U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 applies to our share repurchase program. We do not currently anticipate incurring any excise tax in 2024 based on the fair market value of the common stock issued during 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares for 45.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, there is 157.5 million remaining under the authorized program. See Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds for additional information on repurchases made during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or by such other means as will comply with applicable state and federal securities laws. The timing of any repurchases under the share repurchase program will depend on market conditions, contractual limitations and other considerations. The program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares.

Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased 270.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily attributable to an increase from revenues offset with an increase in lease operating expense of 245.7 million. 
 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased 776.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions of 936.2 million, net of cash acquired, of which 916.0 million related to the QuarterNorth Acquisition. Cash proceeds of 142.0 million was received from the TLCS Divestiture during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 66.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment during the corresponding period in 2023. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information on the QuarterNorth Acquisition and TLCS Divestiture . Additionally, capital expenditures decreased 83.3 million. 
 Financing Activities Cash flow from financing activities changed 449.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the issuance of the New Senior Notes in February 2024 generated 1,220.1 million after deferred financing costs. The net proceeds from the New Senior Notes funded the 897.1 million redemption of the 12.00 Notes and the 11.75 Notes and partially funded the cash portion of the QuarterNorth Acquisition. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 7 Debt for additional information. Additionally, on January 17, 2024, we entered into an underwritten public offering of 34.5 million shares of our common stock, which generated net proceeds of 387.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts of 15.1 million and offering expenses of 0.8 million. The net proceeds from this equity offering partially funded the cash portion of the QuarterNorth Acquisition. Furthermore, Bank Credit Facility net repayments of 75.0 million were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a management goal to maintain or reduce our leverage ratio coupled with a commodity price environment that supported debt repayments to achieve such goal. We had net borrowings from the Bank Credit Facility of 215.0 million during the corresponding period in 2023 due to the funding of the EnVen Acquisition, working capital needs and capital expenditures.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously reported in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q/A for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q/A for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, each filed on the date hereof, subsequent to the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents 

 In September 2024, the Company received a notification from a third party suggesting a mid-level employee (the subject employee was engaged in inappropriate procurement practices. In response, the audit committee of the Company s board of directors (the Audit Committee ), conducted a review of such alleged practices by engaging independent external legal counsel to assist in reviewing the matter and determining the extent of such activities. Such review with external legal counsel did not identify nor implicate other current or former employees and the subject employee was separated from the Company. The Audit Committee also did not identify any related material errors in the Company s historical financial statements. 
 However, in the course of its review, the Company identified two material weaknesses. The first material weakness identified was due to our inability to rely on the review control performed by the subject employee with respect to the estimated decommissioning costs incorporated into the asset retirement obligations recognized in our consolidated financial statements. As such, we could not rely on the subject employee s judgment in the operation of the review control, which is performed upon acquisition of oil and gas assets subject to the retirement obligation and when costs are incurred and reassessed. Although the review of such costs was a task unrelated to the reported conduct subject to our review, we nevertheless determined that the concerns raised regarding the subject employee s reliability made it inappropriate to have relied on such subject employee s judgment in the review function. The second material weakness identified was due to inappropriate segregation of duties without designing and maintaining effective monitoring controls over the timely review of expenditures associated with asset retirement obligation spending, capital expenditures and lease operating expenses. 
 Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses above, management has concluded that our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included herein fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented. 
 Plan for Remediation of Material Weaknesses 
 Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee, has developed a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses. The remediation plan includes, among other things: 
 The separation of the subject employee from the Company. 

The appointment of qualified personnel over business processes related to the review of estimated decommissioning costs. 

The enhancement of policies and training relating to defined roles and responsibilities, the appropriate segregation of duties, and the promotion of ethical behavior. 

Establishing and enhancing the design, including the precision, of the monitoring control(s) related to expenditures associated with asset retirement obligation spending, capital expenditures and lease operating expenses, and the effective operation of such control(s). 

We believe that these actions, collectively, will remediate the material weaknesses identified. However, we will not be able to conclude that we have completely remediated the material weaknesses until the applicable controls are fully implemented and operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through formal testing, that the remediated controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures, and controls and will make any further changes management deems appropriate. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the unremediated material weaknesses noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation, disputes related to our business, regulatory examinations and administrative proceedings primarily arising in the ordinary course of business in jurisdictions in which the Company does business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company s management believes none of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material effect upon the Company s financial position; however, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results from operations for a specific interim period or year. 
 With regard to the previously disclosed legal proceeding filed against the Company and QuarterNorth by U.S. Specialty Insurance Company USSI concerning approximately 80.0 million in surety bonds issued by USSI, the Company has replaced or canceled all but approximately 2.5 million of those bonds with other surety companies as of September 30, 2024 and expects to replace or cancel the remaining bonds in the near future. We expect that the legal proceeding will be resolved at that time. 
 Please see the Company s previous Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 for other legal proceedings arising or resolved during 2024. 
 There have been no additional material developments with respect to the information previously reported under Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of our 2023 Annual Report.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Annual Report and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. Other than set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our 2023 Annual Report or our other SEC filings. 
 Our Rights Agreement includes terms and conditions that could discourage, delay or prevent a takeover or other transaction that some stockholders may consider favorable. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Board declared a dividend of one Right for each share of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on October 11, 2024. Each Right initially entitles the registered holder, subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share for 62.10, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. In general terms, Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires 25 or more of our outstanding Common Stock. If Rights become exercisable, all holders of Rights (other than the person or group triggering the Rights Agreement, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) will have the right, pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company for 62.10, subject to certain potential adjustments, shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate market value of twice that amount. The Rights expire at the earlier of (i) October 1, 2027 and (ii) October 1, 2025 if Stockholder Approval (as defined in the Rights Agreement) has not been received prior to such time, unless such date is advanced or extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Board as permitted in the Rights Agreement. Additional information regarding the Rights Agreement is contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 1, 2024 and the Rights Agreement is filed at Exhibit 4.11 to this Quarterly Report. 
 In general terms, the Rights Agreement will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 25 or more of the Company s outstanding Common Stock without the approval of the Board. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement and the issuance of the Rights may be to discourage any person, entity or group from gaining a control or control-like position in the Company or engaging in other tactics, potentially disadvantaging the interests of the Company s stockholders, without negotiating with the Board and without paying an appropriate control premium to all stockholders. The Rights Agreement is similar to plans adopted by other public companies and is intended to help protect stockholders interests, including protecting stockholders from any efforts at negative control. Further, the Rights Agreement is intended to position the Board to fulfill its duties by providing sufficient time for the Board to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Nevertheless, the Rights Agreement may be considered to have certain anti-takeover effects, including potentially discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or a takeover attempt, even if such actions may be considered beneficial or favorable by some stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the Rights Agreement may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock if it is viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 
 Actions of activist stockholders or others could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price. 
 We may become subject to actions or proposals from stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to such actions can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of the Board, management, and employees from the pursuit of our business strategies. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Activist stockholders or others may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and potential customers, and may affect our relationships with current customers, vendors, investors and other third parties. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at an annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board. Our stock price could also be subject to significant fluctuations or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism. 
 Changes in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 
 There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, including changes arising as a result of any change in administration due to the upcoming U.S. presidential election with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other limitations on cross-border operations. Changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, the extent of which cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.

 Recent and pending management changes could disrupt our operations and impair our ability to attract and retain key personnel. 
 We have experienced recent changes to our senior management team, including the departure of our President and Chief Executive Officer on August 29, 2024. Joseph A. Mills will serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer and President, effective as of August 29, 2024 while our Board conducts a search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer. Changes in our senior management and uncertainty regarding pending changes may disrupt our operations, impact customer and partner relationships, and impair our ability to recruit and retain other needed personnel. Any such disruption or impairment could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations. 
 As more fully disclosed in this Form 10-Q under Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures, our Audit Committee, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 In September 2024, the Company received a notification from a third party suggesting that the subject employee was engaged in inappropriate procurement practices. In response, the Audit Committee conducted a review of such alleged practices by engaging independent external legal counsel to assist in reviewing the matter and determining the extent of such activities. Such review with external legal counsel did not identify nor implicate other current or former employees and the subject employee was separated from the Company. The Audit Committee also did not identify any related material errors in the Company s historical financial statements. 
 However, in the course of its review, the Company identified two material weaknesses. The first material weakness identified was due to our inability to rely on the review control performed by the subject employee with respect to the estimated decommissioning costs incorporated into the asset retirement obligations recognized in our consolidated financial statements. As such, we could not rely on the subject employee s judgment in the operation of the review control, which is performed upon acquisition of oil and gas assets subject to the retirement obligation and when costs are incurred and reassessed. Although the review of such costs was a task unrelated to the reported conduct subject to our review, we nevertheless determined that the concerns raised regarding the subject employee s reliability made it inappropriate to have relied on such subject employee s judgment in the review function. The second material weakness identified was due to inappropriate segregation of duties without designing and maintaining effective monitoring controls over the timely review of expenditures associated with asset retirement obligation spending, capital expenditures and lease operating expenses. 
 While these material weaknesses did not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements, these internal control deficiencies were not remediated as of September 30, 2024 and there is a reasonable possibility that it could have resulted in a material misstatement in the Company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not have been detected. Accordingly, we have determined that these internal control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. While management, under the oversight of our Audit Committee, has taken steps to implement our remediation plan as described more fully in Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures of this Form 10-Q, the material weaknesses described above will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. Furthermore, we can give no assurance that the measures we take will remediate the material weaknesses. 
 We can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate these material weaknesses, or the development of any new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require significant resources to correct the material weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in both investor confidence and the market price of our stock.

EXHIBIT A 
 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
 This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this Agreement is made as of the Date of Grant by and between Talos Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and [____________________] (the Participant ). Capitalized terms used but not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan or the Grant Notice. 
 1. Award . In consideration of the Participant s past and/or continued employment with the Company or an Affiliate and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, effective as of the Date of Grant, the Company hereby grants to the Participant the number of RSUs set forth in the Grant Notice on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. To the extent vested, each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Stock. Vesting and settlement of the RSUs shall occur at the times and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan. Unless and until the RSUs have become vested in the manner set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to receive any Stock or other payments in respect of the RSUs. Prior to settlement of this Award, the RSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from the general assets of the Company. 

2. Ves ting of RSUs . [____________________]. 

3. Dividend Equivalents . In the event that the Company declares and pays a dividend in respect of its outstanding shares of Stock and, on the record date for such dividend, the Participant holds RSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement that have not been settled, the Company shall record the amount of such dividend in a bookkeeping account and pay to the Participant an amount in cash equal to the cash dividends the Participant would have received if the Participant was the holder of record, as of such record date, of a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of RSUs held by the Participant that have not been settled as of such record date, such payment to be made on or within 60 days following the date on which such RSUs vest in accordance with Section 2 . For purposes of clarity, if the RSUs (or any portion thereof) are forfeited by the Participant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Participant shall also forfeit the Dividend Equivalents, if any, accrued with respect to such forfeited RSUs. No interest will accrue on the Dividend Equivalents between the declaration and payment of the applicable dividends and the settlement of the Dividend Equivalents. 

4. Settleme nt of RSUs . If the RSUs vest pursuant to Section 2 , then as soon as administratively practicable following the vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 , but in no event later than 60 days after each such vesting date, the Company shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant s permitted transferee, if applicable) the number of shares of Stock subject to the RSUs that vested and are being settled. Any fractional RSU that becomes vested hereunder shall be rounded down at the time shares of Stock are issued in settlement of such RSU. No fractional shares of Stock, nor the cash value of any fractional shares of Stock, will be issuable or payable to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement. All shares of Stock issued hereunder, if any, shall be delivered either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares to the Participant or by entering such shares in book-entry form, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The value of shares of Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time. Neither this Section 4 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed to create a trust or a funded or secured obligation of any kind. 

Exhibit A-1 

5. Tax Withholding . To the extent that the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award results in compensation income or wages to the Participant for federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes, the Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to this Award, which arrangements may include, at the Company s election, the delivery of cash or cash equivalents, Stock (including previously owned Stock, net settlement, a broker-assisted sale, or other cashless withholding or reduction of the amount of cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable or delivered pursuant to this Award), other property, or any other legal consideration the Committee deems appropriate. If such tax obligations are satisfied through the withholding of shares of Stock that are otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Award (or through the surrender of previously owned shares of Stock by the Participant to the Company), the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be so withheld (or surrendered) shall be the number of shares of Stock that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or surrender equal to the aggregate amount of such tax liabilities, determined based on the greatest withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that may be utilized without creating adverse accounting treatment for the Company with respect to this Award, as determined by the Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any cash payments are made to the Participant under this Agreement, taxes related thereto will be withheld from such payments. The Participant acknowledges that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award or disposition of the underlying shares of Stock and the Participant has been advised, and hereby is advised, to consult a tax advisor. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that none of the Board, the Committee, the Company or any Affiliate have made any representation or warranty as to the tax consequences to the Participant as a result of the receipt of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs or the forfeiture of any of the RSUs. The Participant represents that the Participant is in no manner relying on the Board, the Committee, the Company or an Affiliate or any of their respective managers, directors, officers, employees or authorized representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and financial representatives) for tax advice or an assessment of such tax consequences. 

6. Non-Transferability . During the lifetime of the Participant, the RSUs may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the shares of Stock underlying the RSUs have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares have lapsed. Neither the RSUs nor any interest or right therein shall be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Participant or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means, whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence. 

7. Compliance with Securities Law . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of shares of Stock hereunder, if any, will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. No shares of Stock will be issued hereunder if such issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable law or regulation or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, shares of Stock will not be issued hereunder unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act is in effect at the time of such issuance with respect to the shares to be issued or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares to be issued are permitted to be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Stock hereunder will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to any issuance of 

A- 2 

Stock hereunder, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any requirements that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by the Company. 

8. Legends . If a stock certificate is issued with respect to any shares of Stock delivered hereunder, such certificate shall bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to reflect the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC, any applicable laws or the requirements of any stock exchange on which the Stock is then listed. If the shares of Stock issued hereunder are held in book-entry form, then such entry will reflect that the shares are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. 

9. Rights as a Stockholder . Neither the Participant nor any Person claiming under or through the Participant shall have rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Stock that may become deliverable hereunder unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares of Stock, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of any such shares of Stock, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement. 

10. Execution of Receipts and Releases . Any payments of cash or any issuance or transfer of shares of Stock or other property to the Participant or the Participant s legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, in accordance with this Agreement shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of such Person hereunder. As a condition precedent to such payment or issuance, the Company may require the Participant or the Participant s legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee to execute (and not revoke within any time provided to do so) a release and receipt therefor in such form as it shall determine appropriate; provided, however, that any review period under such release will not modify the date of settlement with respect to vested RSUs. 

11. No Right to Continued Employment or Awards . 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the Participant shall be considered to be employed by the Company as long as the Participant remains an employee of the Company or an Affiliate, or an employee of a corporation or other entity (or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation or other entity) assuming or substituting a new award for this Award. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, it is specifically provided that the Participant shall be considered to have terminated his or her employment with the Company at the time of the termination of the Affiliate status of the entity or other organization that employs the Participant. Nothing in the adoption of the Plan, nor the award of the RSUs thereunder pursuant to the Grant Notice and this Agreement, shall confer upon the Participant the right to continued employment by the Company or any Affiliate, or any other entity, or affect in any way the right of the Company or any such Affiliate, or any other entity to terminate such employment at any time. Unless otherwise provided in a written employment agreement or by applicable law, the Participant s employment by the Company, or any such Affiliate, or any other entity, shall be on an at-will basis, and the employment relationship may be terminated at any time by either the Participant or the Company, or any such Affiliate or any other entity for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause or notice. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate, and such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. 

(b) The grant of the RSUs is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of Awards or benefits in lieu of Awards in the future. Any future Awards will be granted at the sole discretion of the Company. 

A- 3 

12. Non-Co mpetition . 

(a) The Company shall provide the Participant access to the Company s confidential and proprietary information for use only during the period that the Participant is employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates will be entrusting the Participant, in the Participant s unique, special capacity, with developing the goodwill of the Company and its Affiliates, and in consideration of the Company providing the Participant with access to confidential information, and as an express incentive for the Company to provide the Participant with the Award hereunder, the Participant has voluntarily agreed to the covenants set forth in this Section 12 . The Participant agrees and acknowledges that the limitations and restrictions set forth herein, including geographical and temporal restrictions on certain competitive activities, are reasonable in all respects, do not interfere with public interests, will not cause the Participant undue hardship, and are material and substantial parts of this Agreement intended and necessary to prevent unfair competition and to protect the Company s and its Affiliate s confidential information, goodwill and legitimate business interests. 

(b) During the Prohibited Period, the Participant shall not, without the prior written approval of the Company, directly or indirectly, for the Participant or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person or entity of any nature engage in or participate within the Market Area in competition with the Company or any of its Affiliates in any aspect of the Business, which prohibition shall prevent the Participant from directly or indirectly: (i) owning, managing, operating, or being an officer or director of, any business that competes with the Company or any of its Affiliates in the Market Area, or (ii) joining, becoming an employee or consultant of, or otherwise being affiliated with, any person or entity engaged in, or planning to engage in, the Business in the Market Area in competition, or anticipated competition, with the Company or any of its Affiliates in any capacity (with respect to this clause (ii)) in which the Participant s duties or responsibilities: (x) are the same as or similar to the duties or responsibilities that the Participant had on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates, or (y) involve direct or indirect oversight of, or responsibility for, the Business. 

(c) For purposes of this Section 12 , the following definitions shall apply: 

(i) Business shall mean the business and operations that are the same or similar to those performed by the Company or its Affiliates for which the Participant provides services or about which the Participant obtains confidential information during the Participant s employment with the Company, which business and operations include the business of acquiring, exploiting and developing oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast. 

(ii) Market Area shall mean (i) those geographic areas within the parishes listed on Annex 1 hereto and within a 50 mile radius of those areas where the Company or any its Affiliates for which the Participant has material responsibilities conducts any material portion of its business as of the date that the Participant is no longer employed by the Company; and (ii) those other geographic areas outside the State of Louisiana and within a 50-mile radius of the areas where the Company or any of its Affiliates for which the Participant has material responsibilities conducts any material portion of its business as of the date that the Participant is no longer employed by the Company. 

(iii) Prohibited Period shall mean the period during which the Participant is employed by the Company and, in the case of a separation from service by reason of Retirement only, continuing beyond separation from service until the later of (x) one year following Retirement and (y) the date that the RSUs are fully vested.

13. Legal and Equitable Remedies . The Participant acknowledges that a violation or attempted breach of any of the Participant's covenants and agreements in this Agreement will cause such damage as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the Company and the Affiliates shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining the Participant or the affiliates, partners or agents of the Participant from such breach or attempted violation of such covenants and agreements, as well as to recover from the Participant any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the Company or any Affiliate in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees.

EXHIBIT A 
 PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT 
 This Performance Share Unit Agreement (this Agreement is made as of the Date of Grant by and between Talos Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and [_________] (the Participant ). Capitalized terms used but not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan or the Grant Notice. 
 1. Award . In consideration of the Participant s past and/or continued employment with the Company or an Affiliate and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, effective as of the Date of Grant, the Company hereby grants to the Participant the Target PSUs set forth in the Grant Notice on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. Each Earned PSU represents the right to receive one share of Stock. Vesting and settlement of the PSUs shall occur at the times and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan. Depending on the level of performance determined to be attained with respect to the Performance Goal, the number of PSUs granted hereunder that become Earned PSUs may range from 0 to 200 of the Target PSUs. Unless and until the PSUs have become earned in the manner set forth in the Grant Notice and this Agreement, the Participant will have no right to receive any Stock or other payments in respect of the PSUs. Prior to settlement of this Award, the PSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from the general assets of the Company. 

2. Earning of PSUs . Except as otherwise set forth in Section 3 and the Plan, the PSUs shall vest and become earned Earned PSUs in accordance with the Participant s satisfaction of the Service Requirement and the extent to which the Company has satisfied the Performance Goal set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto, which shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion following the end of the Performance Period (and any PSUs that do not become Earned PSUs shall be automatically forfeited). Unless and until the PSUs have vested and become Earned PSUs as described in the preceding sentence, the Participant will have no right to receive any dividends or other distribution with respect to the PSUs. 

3. Effect of Termination of Employment . [ ] 

4. Dividend Equivalents . In the event that the Company declares and pays a dividend in respect of its outstanding shares of Stock and, on the record date for such dividend, the Participant holds PSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement that have not been settled, the Company shall record the amount of such dividend in a bookkeeping account and pay to the Participant an amount in cash equal to the cash dividends the Participant would have received if the Participant was the holder of record, as of such record date, of a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of PSUs held by the Participant that have not been settled as of such record date, such payment to be made on the date on which any Earned PSUs are settled in accordance with Section 3 or Section 5 . For purposes of clarity, if the PSUs (or any portion thereof) are forfeited by the Participant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Participant shall also forfeit the Dividend Equivalents, if any, accrued with respect to such forfeited PSUs. No interest will accrue on the Dividend Equivalents between the declaration and payment of the applicable dividends and the settlement of the Dividend Equivalents. 

5. Settlement of PSUs . 

(a) Time of Settlement . If the PSUs become Earned PSUs pursuant to Section 3(a) , Section 3(b)(ii) or Section 3(c)(ii) they will be settled at the time specified in Section 3 . If the PSUs become Earned PSUs pursuant to Section 2 , Section 3(b)(i) or Section 3(c)(i) , then they will be settled as soon as administratively 

Exhibit A-1 

practicable following the Committee s certification of the level of attainment of the Performance Goal, but in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year following the Performance Period End Date. 

(b) Form of Settlement . If the PSUs become Earned PSUs, then the Company shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant s permitted transferee, if applicable), a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Earned PSUs. 

(c) Additional Settlement Details . Any fractional PSU that becomes earned hereunder shall be rounded down at the time shares of Stock are issued in settlement of such PSU. No fractional shares of Stock, nor the cash value of any fractional shares of Stock, shall be issuable or payable to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement. All shares of Stock issued hereunder, if any, shall be delivered either by delivering one or more certificates for shares to the Participant or by entering such shares in book entry form, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The value of shares of Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time. Neither this Section 5 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed to create a trust or a funded or secured obligation of any kind. 

6. Tax Withholding . To the extent that the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award results in compensation income or wages to the Participant for federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes, the Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to this Award, which arrangements may include, at the Company s election, the delivery of cash or cash equivalents, Stock (including previously owned Stock, net settlement, a broker-assisted sale, or other cashless withholding or reduction of the amount of cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable or delivered pursuant to this Award), other property, or any other legal consideration the Committee deems appropriate. If such tax obligations are satisfied through the withholding of shares of Stock that are otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Award (or through the surrender of previously owned shares of Stock by the Participant to the Company), the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be so withheld (or surrendered) shall be the number of shares of Stock that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or surrender equal to the aggregate amount of such tax liabilities, determined based on the greatest withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that may be utilized without creating adverse accounting treatment for the Company with respect to this Award, as determined by the Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any cash payments are made to the Participant under this Agreement, taxes related thereto will be withheld from such payments. The Participant acknowledges that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award or disposition of the underlying shares of Stock and the Participant has been advised, and hereby is advised, to consult a tax advisor. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that none of the Board, the Committee, the Company or any Affiliate have made any representation or warranty as to the tax consequences to the Participant as a result of the receipt of the PSUs, the earning of the PSUs or the forfeiture of any of the PSUs. The Participant represents that the Participant is in no manner relying on the Board, the Committee, the Company or an Affiliate or any of their respective managers, directors, officers, employees or authorized representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and financial representatives) for tax advice or an assessment of such tax consequences. 

7. Non-Transferability . During the lifetime of the Participant, the PSUs may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the shares of Stock underlying the PSUs have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares have lapsed. Neither the PSUs nor any interest or right therein shall be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Participant or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means, whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable 

Exhibit A- 2 

proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence. 

8. Compliance with Securities Law . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of shares of Stock hereunder, if any, will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. No shares of Stock will be issued hereunder if such issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable law or regulation or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, shares of Stock will not be issued hereunder unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act is in effect at the time of such issuance with respect to the shares to be issued or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares to be issued are permitted to be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Stock hereunder will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to any issuance of Stock hereunder, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any requirements that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by the Company. 

9. Legends . If a stock certificate is issued with respect to any shares of Stock delivered hereunder, such certificate shall bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to reflect the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC, any applicable laws or the requirements of any stock exchange on which the Stock is then listed. If the shares of Stock issued hereunder are held in book-entry form, then such entry will reflect that the shares are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. 

10. Rights as a Stockholder . Neither the Participant nor any Person claiming under or through the Participant shall have rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Stock that may become deliverable hereunder unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares of Stock, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of any such shares of Stock, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement. 

11. Execution of Receipts and Releases . Any payments of cash or any issuance or transfer of shares of Stock or other property to the Participant or the Participant s legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, in accordance with this Agreement shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of such Person hereunder. As a condition precedent to such payment or issuance, the Company may require the Participant or the Participant s legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee to execute (and not revoke within any time provided to do so) a release and receipt therefor in such form as it shall determine appropriate; provided, however, that any review period under such release will not modify the date of settlement with respect to Earned PSUs. 

12. No Right to Continued Employment or Awards . 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the Participant shall be considered to be employed by the Company as long as the Participant remains an employee of the Company or an Affiliate, or an employee of a corporation or other entity (or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation or other entity) assuming or substituting a new award for this Award. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, it is specifically provided that the Participant shall be considered to have terminated his or her employment with the Company at the time of the termination of the Affiliate status of the entity or other organization that employs the Participant. Nothing in the adoption of the Plan, nor the award of the PSUs thereunder pursuant to the Grant Notice and this Agreement, 

Exhibit A- 3 

shall confer upon the Participant the right to continued employment by the Company or any Affiliate, or any other entity, or affect in any way the right of the Company or any such Affiliate, or any other entity to terminate such employment at any time. Unless otherwise provided in a written employment agreement or by applicable law, the Participant s employment by the Company, or any such Affiliate, or any other entity, shall be on an at-will basis, and the employment relationship may be terminated at any time by either the Participant or the Company, or any such Affiliate or any other entity for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause or notice. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate, and such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. 

(b) The grant of the PSUs is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of Awards or benefits in lieu of Awards in the future. Any future Awards will be granted at the sole discretion of the Company. 

13. Non-Competition . 

(a) The Company shall provide the Participant access to the Company s confidential and proprietary information for use only during the period that the Participant is employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates will be entrusting the Participant, in the Participant s unique, special capacity, with developing the goodwill of the Company and its Affiliates, and in consideration of the Company providing the Participant with access to confidential information, and as an express incentive for the Company to provide the Participant with the Award hereunder, the Participant has voluntarily agreed to the covenants set forth in this Section 13 . The Participant agrees and acknowledges that the limitations and restrictions set forth herein, including geographical and temporal restrictions on certain competitive activities, are reasonable in all respects, do not interfere with public interests, will not cause the Participant undue hardship, and are material and substantial parts of this Agreement intended and necessary to prevent unfair competition and to protect the Company s and its Affiliate s confidential information, goodwill and legitimate business interests. 

(b) During the Prohibited Period, the Participant shall not, without the prior written approval of the Company, directly or indirectly, for the Participant or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person or entity of any nature engage in or participate within the Market Area in competition with the Company or any of its Affiliates in any aspect of the Business, which prohibition shall prevent the Participant from directly or indirectly: (i) owning, managing, operating, or being an officer or director of, any business that competes with the Company or any of its Affiliates in the Market Area, or (ii) joining, becoming an employee or consultant of, or otherwise being affiliated with, any person or entity engaged in, or planning to engage in, the Business in the Market Area in competition, or anticipated competition, with the Company or any of its Affiliates in any capacity (with respect to this clause (ii)) in which the Participant s duties or responsibilities: (x) are the same as or similar to the duties or responsibilities that the Participant had on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates, or (y) involve direct or indirect oversight of, or responsibility for, the Business. 

(c) For purposes of this Section 13 , the following definitions shall apply: 

(i) Business shall mean the business and operations that are the same or similar to those performed by the Company or its Affiliates for which the Participant provides services or about which the Participant obtains confidential information during the Participant s employment with the Company, which business and operations include the business of acquiring, exploiting and developing oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast. 

Exhibit A- 4

(iii) Prohibited Period shall mean the period during which the Participant is employed by the Company and, in the case of a separation from service by reason of Retirement only, continuing beyond separation from service until the later of (x) one year following Retirement and (y) the end of the Performance Period. 

14. Legal and Equitable Remedies . The Participant acknowledges that a violation or attempted breach of any of the Participant's covenants and agreements in this Agreement will cause such damage as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the Company and the Affiliates shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining the Participant or the affiliates, partners or agents of the Participant from such breach or attempted violation of such covenants and agreements, as well as to recover from the Participant any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the Company or any Affiliate in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. The parties to this Agreement agree that no bond or other security shall be required in connection with such injunction. Any exercise by either of the parties to this Agreement of its rights pursuant to this Section 13 shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies to which such party may be entitled.

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Plan to the contrary, the PSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement are intended to be exempt from or compliant with the applicable requirements of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the settlement of PSUs under this Agreement may only be made upon an event and in a manner that complies with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules or an applicable exemption. Any settlement of PSUs under this Agreement that may be excluded from the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service or as a short-term deferral shall be excluded to the maximum extent possible.

Any settlement of PSUs to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a separation from service under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules. To the extent that the Committee determines that the PSUs may not be exempt from the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, then, if the Participant is deemed to be a specified employee within the meaning of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, as determined by the Committee, at a time when the Participant becomes eligible for settlement of the PSUs upon his separation from service within the meaning of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, then to the extent necessary to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, such settlement will be delayed until the earlier of: (a) the date that is six months following the Participant s separation from service and (b) the Participant s death. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Affiliates make no representations that the PSUs provided under this Agreement are exempt from or compliant with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules and in no event shall the Company or any Affiliate be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Participant on account of non-compliance with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules.

EXHIBIT A 
 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
 This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this Agreement is made as of the Date of Grant by and between Talos Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and ____________________ (the Participant ). Capitalized terms used but not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan or the Grant Notice. 
 1. Award . In consideration of the Participant s past and/or continued employment with the Company or an Affiliate and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, effective as of the Date of Grant, the Company hereby grants to the Participant the number of RSUs set forth in the Grant Notice on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. To the extent vested, each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Stock. Vesting and settlement of the RSUs shall occur at the times and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan. Unless and until the RSUs have become vested in the manner set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to receive any Stock or other payments in respect of the RSUs. Prior to settlement of this Award, the RSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from the general assets of the Company. 

2. Vesting of RSUs . [ ] 

3. Dividend Equivalents . In the event that the Company declares and pays a dividend in respect of its outstanding shares of Stock and, on the record date for such dividend, the Participant holds RSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement that have not been settled, the Company shall record the amount of such dividend in a bookkeeping account and pay to the Participant an amount in cash equal to the cash dividends the Participant would have received if the Participant was the holder of record, as of such record date, of a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of RSUs held by the Participant that have not been settled as of such record date, such payment to be made on or within 60 days following the date on which such RSUs vest in accordance with Section 2 . For purposes of clarity, if the RSUs (or any portion thereof) are forfeited by the Participant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Participant shall also forfeit the Dividend Equivalents, if any, accrued with respect to such forfeited RSUs. No interest will accrue on the Dividend Equivalents between the declaration and payment of the applicable dividends and the settlement of the Dividend Equivalents. 

4. Settlement of RSUs . If the RSUs vest pursuant to Section 2 , then as soon as administratively practicable following the vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 , but in no event later than 60 days after each such vesting date, the Company shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant s permitted transferee, if applicable) the number of shares of Stock subject to the RSUs that vested and are being settled. Any fractional RSU that becomes vested hereunder shall be rounded down at the time shares of Stock are issued in settlement of such RSU. No fractional shares of Stock, nor the cash value of any fractional shares of Stock, will be issuable or payable to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement. All shares of Stock issued hereunder, if any, shall be delivered either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares to the Participant or by entering such shares in book-entry form, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The value of shares of Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time. Neither this Section 4 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed to create a trust or a funded or secured obligation of any kind. 

Exhibit A- 1 

5. Tax Withholding . To the extent that the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award results in compensation income or wages to the Participant for federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes, the Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to this Award, which arrangements may include, at the Company s election, the delivery of cash or cash equivalents, Stock (including previously owned Stock, net settlement, a broker-assisted sale, or other cashless withholding or reduction of the amount of cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable or delivered pursuant to this Award), other property, or any other legal consideration the Committee deems appropriate. If such tax obligations are satisfied through the withholding of shares of Stock that are otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Award (or through the surrender of previously owned shares of Stock by the Participant to the Company), the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be so withheld (or surrendered) shall be the number of shares of Stock that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or surrender equal to the aggregate amount of such tax liabilities, determined based on the greatest withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that may be utilized without creating adverse accounting treatment for the Company with respect to this Award, as determined by the Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any cash payments are made to the Participant under this Agreement, taxes related thereto will be withheld from such payments. The Participant acknowledges that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award or disposition of the underlying shares of Stock and the Participant has been advised, and hereby is advised, to consult a tax advisor. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that none of the Board, the Committee, the Company or any Affiliate have made any representation or warranty as to the tax consequences to the Participant as a result of the receipt of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs or the forfeiture of any of the RSUs. The Participant represents that the Participant is in no manner relying on the Board, the Committee, the Company or an Affiliate or any of their respective managers, directors, officers, employees or authorized representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and financial representatives) for tax advice or an assessment of such tax consequences. 

6. Non-Transferability . During the lifetime of the Participant, the RSUs may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the shares of Stock underlying the RSUs have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares have lapsed. Neither the RSUs nor any interest or right therein shall be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Participant or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means, whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence. 

7. Compliance with Securities Law . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of shares of Stock hereunder, if any, will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. No shares of Stock will be issued hereunder if such issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable law or regulation or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, shares of Stock will not be issued hereunder unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act is in effect at the time of such issuance with respect to the shares to be issued or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares to be issued are permitted to be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Stock hereunder will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to any issuance of 

Exhibit A- 2 

Stock hereunder, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any requirements that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by the Company. 

8. Legends . If a stock certificate is issued with respect to any shares of Stock delivered hereunder, such certificate shall bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to reflect the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC, any applicable laws or the requirements of any stock exchange on which the Stock is then listed. If the shares of Stock issued hereunder are held in book-entry form, then such entry will reflect that the shares are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. 

9. Rights as a Stockholder . Neither the Participant nor any Person claiming under or through the Participant shall have rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Stock that may become deliverable hereunder unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares of Stock, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of any such shares of Stock, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement. 

10. Execution of Receipts and Releases . Any payments of cash or any issuance or transfer of shares of Stock or other property to the Participant or the Participant s legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, in accordance with this Agreement shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of such Person hereunder. As a condition precedent to such payment or issuance, the Company may require the Participant or the Participant s legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee to execute (and not revoke within any time provided to do so) a release and receipt therefor in such form as it shall determine appropriate; provided, however, that any review period under such release will not modify the date of settlement with respect to vested RSUs. 

11. No Right to Continued Employment or Awards . 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the Participant shall be considered to be employed by the Company as long as the Participant remains an employee of the Company or an Affiliate, or an employee of a corporation or other entity (or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation or other entity) assuming or substituting a new award for this Award. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, it is specifically provided that the Participant shall be considered to have terminated his or her employment with the Company at the time of the termination of the Affiliate status of the entity or other organization that employs the Participant. Nothing in the adoption of the Plan, nor the award of the RSUs thereunder pursuant to the Grant Notice and this Agreement, shall confer upon the Participant the right to continued employment by the Company or any Affiliate, or any other entity, or affect in any way the right of the Company or any such Affiliate, or any other entity to terminate such employment at any time. Unless otherwise provided in a written employment agreement or by applicable law, the Participant s employment by the Company, or any such Affiliate, or any other entity, shall be on an at-will basis, and the employment relationship may be terminated at any time by either the Participant or the Company, or any such Affiliate or any other entity for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause or notice. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate, and such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. 

(b) The grant of the RSUs is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of Awards or benefits in lieu of Awards in the future. Any future Awards will be granted at the sole discretion of the Company. 

Exhibit A- 3 

12. Legal and Equitable Remedies . The Participant acknowledges that a violation or attempted breach of any of the Participant's covenants and agreements in this Agreement will cause such damage as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the Company and the Affiliates shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining the Participant or the affiliates, partners or agents of the Participant from such breach or attempted violation of such covenants and agreements, as well as to recover from the Participant any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the Company or any Affiliate in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. The parties to this Agreement agree that no bond or other security shall be required in connection with such injunction. Any exercise by either of the parties to this Agreement of its rights pursuant to this Section 12 shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies to which such party may be entitled. 

13. Notices . All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

17. Severability and Waiver . If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement or failure to exercise any right hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or right. The failure of any party to take action by reason of such breach or to exercise any such right shall not deprive the party of the right to take action at any time while or after such breach or condition giving rise to such rights continues. 

18. Clawback . Notwithstanding any provision in the Grant Notice, this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, to the extent required by (a) applicable law, including, without limitation, the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, any SEC rule or any applicable securities exchange listing standards and/or (b) any policy that may be adopted or amended by the Board from time to time, all cash or shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be subject to forfeiture, repurchase, recoupment and/or cancellation to the extent necessary to comply with such law(s) and/or policy.

21. Headings . Headings are for convenience only and are not deemed to be part of this Agreement. 

22. Counterparts . The Grant Notice may be executed in one or more counterparts, including by way of any electronic or digital signature, subject to applicable law, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the settlement of RSUs under this Agreement may only be made upon an event and in a manner that complies with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules or an applicable exemption. Any settlement of RSUs under this Agreement that may be excluded from the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service 

Exhibit A- 5

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Affiliates make no representations that the RSUs provided under this Agreement are exempt from or compliant with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules and in no event shall the Company or any Affiliate be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Participant on account of non-compliance with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules.
