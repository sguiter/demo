PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 1. Interim Financial Statements 

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor deprived our investors of the benefits of such inspections. 

Our auditor, ARK Pro CPA Co. ARK ), the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report in our SEC filings, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States, pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is located in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC ("Hong Kong"), China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB was unable to conduct inspections and investigations before 2022. As a result, we and investors in our securities were deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong in 2022. However, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in Hong Kong in the past made it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China mainland and Hong Kong that have been subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential investors in our securities to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. 

Our common stock may be delisted and prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, as amended by the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China mainland and Hong Kong. The delisting of our common stock or the threat of their being delisted could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or be worthless, and thus you could lose all or substantial portion of your investment. 

On December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was signed into law that states if the SEC determines that issuers have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to PCAOB inspection for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit its common stock from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the U.S. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, to prohibit securities of any registrant from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges or traded over-the-counter if the auditor of the registrant s financial statements is not subject to PCAOB inspection for two consecutive years, instead of three consecutive years as enacted in the HFCAA. On December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments implementing the disclosure and submission requirements of the HFCAA, pursuant to which the SEC will identify an issuer as a Commission-Identified Issuer if the issuer has filed an annual report containing an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely, and will then impose a trading prohibition on an issuer after it is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years. On December 29, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law. 

On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a HFCAA Determination Report (the 2021 PCAOB Determinations to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong because of positions taken by the Chinese authorities, and our auditor was subject to this determination. On May 13, 2022, the SEC conclusively identified us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 

On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol on agreement governing on inspections of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, with China Securities Regulatory Commission CSRC and Ministry of Finance MOF of the PRC, in regarding to governing inspections and investigations of audit firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong (the Agreement ). As stated in the Agreement, the Chinese authorities committed that the PCAOB has direct access to view complete audit work papers under its inspections or investigations and has sole discretion to the selected audit firms and audit engagements. The Agreement opens access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate the registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong completely. The PCAOB then thoroughly tested compliance with every aspect of the Agreement necessary to determine complete access. This included sending a team of PCAOB staff to conduct on-site inspections and investigations in Hong Kong over a nine-week period from September to November 2022. 

On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued its 2022 HFCAA Determination Report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its 2021 PCAOB Determinations that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. However, whether the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our, and our auditor s control. 

The PCAOB is continuing to demand complete access in China mainland and Hong Kong moving forward and is already making plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB does not have to wait another year to reassess its determinations. Should the PRC authorities obstruct the PCAOB s access to inspect or investigate completely in any way and at any point, the PCAOB will act immediately to consider the need to issue new determinations consistent with the HFCAA. 

We cannot assure you that our auditor will not be determined as a register public accounting firm that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely for two consecutive years because of positions taken by the Chinese authorities and/or any other causes in the future. Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among other jurisdictions. If the PCAOB in the future again determines that it is unable to inspect and investigate completely auditors in China mainland and Hong Kong, we may be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer accordingly. If this happens, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common stock, and there is no certainty that we will be able to continue listing our common stock on other non-U.S. stock exchanges or that an active market for our common stock will immediately develop outside of the U.S. The prohibiting from trading in the United States or delisting of our common stock or the threat of their being delisted could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or be worthless, and thus you could lose all or substantial portion of your investment.

Summarized below is the information related to the financial performance of the VIEs reported in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 

Cost of revenues 

Total operating expenses 

Net loss 

million and a net operating cash outflow of US million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of US million and working capital of US million, compared with approximately US million and US million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company plans to optimize its internet resources cost investment strategy to improve the gross profit margin of its core business and to further strengthen the accounts receivables collection management and negotiate more favorable payment terms with major suppliers, all of which will contribute to substantially increase the cashflows from operations. To further improve liquidity, the Company also plans to reduce operating costs through optimizing staffing across various offices and, if needed, downsizing office leasing spaces. Beginning in early 2022, the Company introduced its SaaS services to customers. The Company s SaaS services are provided based on technologies of its self-developed Blockchain Integrated Framework BIF platform. The BIF platform enables the Company s clients to utilize the BIF platform as an enterprise management software to record, share and storage operating data on-chain, and/or to generate unique designed Non-fungible Token NFTs for their IPs and certificates. While the revenues from the new SaaS services business and its profitability have not met the Company s expectations, the Company still expects these services to generate positive cash flow and improve liquidity since they rely on technologies of its self-developed software platform, thus reducing the need for substantial cash outflow to third-party service providers. Revenues from our new SaaS services business was US million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

If the Company fails to achieve these goals, the Company may need additional financing to execute its business plan. If additional financing is required, the Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form, and the Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are not available, or that the Company is unsuccessful in increasing its gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its uncertain ability to increase gross profit margin and reduce operating loss from its core business and/or obtain additional equity and/or debt financing. The accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2024 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. If the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, it may have to liquidate its assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on the financial statements. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information as of September 30, 2024 and for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures, which are normally included in complete consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, have been omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, previously filed with the SEC (the 2023 Form 10-K on June 28, 2024. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company s condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, its condensed consolidated results of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and its condensed consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as applicable, have been made. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods. 

No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be converted into US at the above rates. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 - 13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendments in this ASU require the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost, which replace the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology. The Company, as a SEC smaller reporting company, has adopted the amendments in this ASU from January 1, 2023, using a modified retrospective transition method and did not restate the related accounts in the comparable period. Instead, the Company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase the opening balance of its accumulated deficit on January 1, 2023 by US million, of which US million was related to the cumulative-effect adjustment to allowance for credit loss of accounts receivable, and the remaining US million was related to the cumulative-effect adjustment to allowance for credit loss of other current assets, which primarily consisted of short-term loans the Company provided to unrelated parties. 

The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company's current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the related financial assets. The allowance for credit losses is presented as a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial asset(s) to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset(s). 

The Company considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for credit losses, including the aging and aging trends, customer/other parties creditworthiness and specific exposures related to particular customers/other parties. The Company also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country specific risks and economic factors that may affect a customer/other party s ability to pay in establishing and adjusting its allowance for credit losses. The Company assesses collectability by reviewing the financial assets on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when the Company identifies specific customers/other parties with known disputes or collectability issues. Accounts receivable and short-term loans to unrelated parties are written off after all collection efforts have ceased. 

The following tables summarized the movements of the Company s credit losses for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

As a result, the number of shares of the Company s authorized Common Stock was reduced from shares to shares and the issued and outstanding number of shares of the Common Stock was correspondingly decreased. The Reverse Stock Split has no effect on the par value of the Company s Common Stock or authorized shares of preferred stock. 

When the Reverse Stock Split became effective, each four shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock were converted into one newly issued and outstanding share of Common Stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of Common Stock that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest full share. No cash or other consideration was paid in connection with any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split. 

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, shares of Common Stock that were issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 was reduced to shares of Common Stock (taking into account the rounding of fractional shares). 

Except where otherwise specified, all number of shares, number of warrants, share prices, exercise prices and per share data in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated as if the Reverse Stock Split occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.

Deferred tax assets, net 

The U.S. holding company has incurred aggregate net operating losses NOLs of approximately US million and US million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The NOLs carryforwards as of December 31, 2017 gradually expire over time, the last of which expires in 2037. NOLs incurred after December 31, 2017 will no longer be available to carry back but can be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit of on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its net U.S. deferred tax assets, since due to uncertainties surrounding future utilization, the Company estimates there will not be sufficient future earnings to utilize its U.S. deferred tax assets. 

The NOLs carried forward incurred by the Company s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs were approximately US million and US million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The losses carryforwards gradually expire over time, the last of which will expire in 2028. The related deferred tax assets were calculated based on the respective NOLs incurred by each of the PRC subsidiaries and VIEs and the respective corresponding enacted tax rate that will be in effect in the period in which the losses are expected to be utilized. 

The Company recorded approximately US million and US million valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, because it is considered more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized through sufficient future earnings of the entities to which the operating losses related. 

For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded approximately US million and US million deferred tax valuation allowance, respectively. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded approximately US million and US million deferred tax valuation allowance, respectively.

of their respective after-tax profit based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations each year to the statutory surplus reserve, until the balance in the reserve reaches of the registered capital of the respective PRC entities. In accordance with these PRC laws and regulations, the Company s PRC subsidiaries, the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Nevada holding company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net assets restricted in the aggregate, that are included in the Company s consolidated net assets, were approximately US million and US million, respectively. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund of a foreign-invested PRC entity and appropriation to the discretionary surplus reserve of other PRC entities are at the discretion of the board of directors. To date, none of the Company s PRC subsidiaries, the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries appropriated any of these non-mandatory funds and reserves. Furthermore, if these entities incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. 

Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax EIT Law and related regulations, dividends, interests, rent or royalties payable by a foreign-invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside China are subject to a withholding tax. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Hong Kong has a tax arrangement with mainland China that provides for a 5 withholding tax on dividends subject to certain conditions and requirements, such as the requirements that the Hong Kong enterprise owns at least 25 of the PRC enterprise distributing the dividend at all times within the 12-month period immediately preceding the distribution of dividends and provides that the recipient can demonstrate it is a Hong Kong tax resident and it is the beneficial owner of the dividends. The PRC government adopted regulations in 2018 which stipulate that in determining whether a non-resident enterprise has the status as a beneficial owner, comprehensive analysis shall be conducted based on the factors listed therein and the actual circumstances of the specific case shall be taken into consideration. Specifically, it expressly excludes an agent or a designated payee from being considered as a beneficial owner . The Company owns its PRC subsidiaries through China Net HK. China Net HK currently does not hold a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, there is no assurance that the reduced withholding tax rate will be available for the Company. If China Net HK is not considered to be the beneficial owner of the dividends by the Chinese local tax authority, any dividends paid to it by the Company s PRC subsidiaries would be subject to a withholding tax rate of . 

There are no restrictions for the consolidated VIEs to settle the amounts owed under the VIE agreements to Rise King WFOE. However, arrangements and transactions among affiliated entities may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. If at any time the VIE agreements and the related fee structure between the consolidated VIEs and Rise King WFOE is determined to be non-substantive and disallowed by Chinese tax authorities, the consolidated VIEs could, as a matter of last resort, make a non-deductible transfer to Rise King WFOE for the amounts owed under the VIE agreements. This would result in such transfer being non-deductible expenses for the consolidated VIEs but still taxable income for Rise King WFOE. If this happens, it may increase the Company s tax burden and reduce its after-tax income in the PRC, and may materially and adversely affect its ability to make distributions to the holding company. The Company s management is of the view that the likelihood that this scenario would happen is remote. 

The Company s PRC subsidiaries generate all of their revenue in Renminbi, Renminbi is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of the Company s PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends/make distributions to the Company. The Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Shortages in availability of foreign currency may then restrict the ability of the Company s PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to the Nevada holding company for the holding company to pay dividends to the U.S. investors. Renminbi is currently convertible under the current account, which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, which includes foreign direct investment and foreign debt. Currently, the Company s PRC subsidiaries may purchase foreign currency for settlement of current account transactions, including payment of dividends to the Nevada holding company, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China (the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities may limit or eliminate the Company s ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. The Chinese government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and additional restrictions and substantial vetting processes may be instituted by the SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit the Company s ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to pay dividends in foreign currencies to holders of the Company s securities. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, the SAFE and other relevant Chinese governmental authorities. This could affect the Company s ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for its PRC subsidiaries. 

To date, none of the Company s subsidiaries has made any distribution of earnings or issued any dividends to their respective shareholder in or outside of China, or to the Nevada holding company, and the Nevada holding company has never declared or paid any cash dividends to U.S. investors. 

The Company does not have any present plan to make any distribution of earnings/issue any dividends directly or indirectly to its Nevada holding company or pay any cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future, because the Company currently intend to retain most, if not all, of its available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand the Company s business.

of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were held by major financial institutions located in China, the remaining was held by financial institutions located in the United States of America. The Company believes that these financial institutions located in China and the United States of America are of high credit quality. For accounts receivable and deposits and loans to unrelated parties, the Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer s or other parties financial condition, generally without requiring collateral or other security. In order to minimize the credit risk, the Company delegated a team responsible for credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. Further, the Company reviews the recoverable amount of each individual receivable at each balance sheet date to ensure that adequate allowances are made for doubtful accounts. In this regard, the Company considers that the Company s credit risk for accounts receivable and deposits and loans to unrelated parties are significantly reduced.

The Company may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in its ordinary course of business. The Company evaluates the status of each legal matter and assesses the potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceedings or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimated. As of the date hereof, based on the information currently available, the Company believes that the loss contingencies that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this interim report. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or future strategies that are signified by the words expect, anticipate, intend, believe, or similar language. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor deprived our investors of the benefits of such inspections. 

Our auditor, ARK Pro CPA Co. ARK ), the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report in our SEC filings, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States, pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is located in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC ("Hong Kong"), China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB was unable to conduct inspections and investigations before 2022. As a result, we and investors in our securities were deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong in 2022. However, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in Hong Kong in the past made it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China mainland and Hong Kong that have been subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential investors in our securities to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. 

Our common stock may be delisted and prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, as amended by the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China mainland and Hong Kong. The delisting of our common stock or the threat of their being delisted could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or be worthless, and thus you could lose all or substantial portion of your investment. 

On December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was signed into law that states if the SEC determines that issuers have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to PCAOB inspection for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit its common stock from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the U.S. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, to prohibit securities of any registrant from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges or traded over-the-counter if the auditor of the registrant s financial statements is not subject to PCAOB inspection for two consecutive years, instead of three consecutive years as enacted in the HFCAA. On December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments implementing the disclosure and submission requirements of the HFCAA, pursuant to which the SEC will identify an issuer as a Commission-Identified Issuer if the issuer has filed an annual report containing an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely, and will then impose a trading prohibition on an issuer after it is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years. On December 29, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law. 

On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a HFCAA Determination Report (the 2021 PCAOB Determinations to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong because of positions taken by the Chinese authorities, and our auditor was subject to this determination. On May 13, 2022, the SEC conclusively identified us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol on agreement governing on inspections of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, with China Securities Regulatory Commission CSRC and Ministry of Finance MOF of the PRC, in regarding to governing inspections and investigations of audit firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong (the Agreement ). As stated in the Agreement, the Chinese authorities committed that the PCAOB has direct access to view complete audit work papers under its inspections or investigations and has sole discretion to the selected audit firms and audit engagements. The Agreement opens access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate the registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong completely. The PCAOB then thoroughly tested compliance with every aspect of the Agreement necessary to determine complete access. This included sending a team of PCAOB staff to conduct on-site inspections and investigations in Hong Kong over a nine-week period from September to November 2022. 

On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued its 2022 HFCAA Determination Report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its 2021 PCAOB Determinations that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. However, whether the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our, and our auditor s, control. 

The PCAOB is continuing to demand complete access in China mainland and Hong Kong moving forward and is already making plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB does not have to wait another year to reassess its determinations. Should the PRC authorities obstruct the PCAOB s access to inspect or investigate completely in any way and at any point, the PCAOB will act immediately to consider the need to issue new determinations consistent with the HFCAA. 

We cannot assure you that our auditor will not be determined as a register public accounting firm that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely for two consecutive years because of positions taken by the Chinese authorities and/or any other causes in the future. Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among other jurisdictions. If the PCAOB in the future again determines that it is unable to inspect and investigate completely auditors in China mainland and Hong Kong, we may be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer accordingly. If this happens, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common stock, and there is no certainty that we will be able to continue listing our common stock on other non-U.S. stock exchanges or that an active market for our common stock will immediately develop outside of the U.S. The prohibiting from trading in the United States or delisting of our common stock or the threat of their being delisted could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or be worthless, and thus you could lose all or substantial portion of your investment. 

Overview 

Our company was incorporated in the State of Texas in April 2006 and re-domiciled to become a Nevada corporation in October 2006. As a result of a share exchange transaction we consummated with China Net BVI in June 2009, we are now a holding company, which through certain contractual arrangements with operating companies in the PRC, is engaged in providing Internet advertising, precision marketing, blockchain-based SaaS services, and ecommerce O2O advertising and marketing services and the related data and technical services to SMEs in the PRC. 

Through our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs, we primarily operate a one-stop services for our clients on our Omni-channel advertising, precision marketing and data analysis management system. We offer a variety channels of advertising and marketing services through this system, which primarily include distribution of the right to use search engine marketing services we purchased from key search engines, provision of online advertising placements services on our web portals, provision of ecommerce O2O advertising and marketing services as well as provision of other related value-added data and technical services to maximize market exposure and effectiveness for our clients. Beginning in early 2022, we introduced our SaaS services to customers. The SaaS services were designated in providing one-stop blockchain-powered enterprise management solutions via our BIF platform in forms of unique NFT generations, data record, share and storage modules subscriptions etc.

Basis of presentation, management estimates and critical accounting policies 

Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of our company, and all of our subsidiaries and VIEs. We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. In order to understand the significant accounting policies that we adopted for the preparation of our condensed consolidated interim financial statements, readers should refer to the information set forth in Note 4 Summary of significant accounting policies to our audited financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, estimation of current expected credit loss and fair value measurement of warrant liabilities have the greatest potential impacts on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Our revenues are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Our revenues from distribution of the right to use search engine marketing service are recognized on a gross basis, because we determine that we are a principal in the transaction who control the services before they are transferred to our customers. 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable and short-term loans provided to unrelated parties, which are recorded as valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of the related financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets. The allowance for credit losses reflects our current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the related financial assets. We consider various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting our allowance for credit losses, including the aging and aging trends, customer/other parties creditworthiness and specific exposures related to particular customers/other parties. We also monitor other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country specific risks and economic factors that may affect a customer/other party s ability to pay in establishing and adjusting its allowance for credit losses. We assess collectability by reviewing the financial assets on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers/other parties with known disputes or collectability issues. Accounts receivable and short-term loans to unrelated parties are written off after all collection efforts have ceased. 

We determined that the warrants we issued in various financing activities should be accounted for as derivative liabilities and measured at fair value with changes in fair value be recorded in earnings in each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value of our warrant liabilities was determined based on significant unobservable inputs, such as volatility of our stock price, risk free interest rate.

Operating Expenses: Our total operating expenses was approximately US 3.67 million and US 2.05 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with approximately US 3.83 million and US 1.60 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Sales and marketing expenses: Sales and marketing expenses was US 0.21 million and US 0.08 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with approximately US 0.15 million and US 0.06 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of staff salaries and benefits, performance bonuses, travel expenses, communication expenses and other general office expenses of our sales department. Due to certain aspects of our business nature, the fluctuation of our sales and marketing expenses usually does not have a direct linear relationship with the fluctuation of our net revenues. 

General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses was US 3.46 million and US 1.97 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with US 3.66 million and US 1.55 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits of management, accounting, human resources and administrative personnel, office rentals, depreciation of office equipment, allowance for doubtful accounts, professional service fees, maintenance, utilities and other general office expenses of our supporting and administrative departments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following reasons: (1) the increase in share-based compensation expenses of approximately US 1.55 million, due to the issuance of 0.375 million fully-vested shares of the Company s restricted common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year; (2) the decrease in allowance for expected credit losses of approximately US 0.58 million; and (3) the decrease in other general administrative expenses of approximately US 1.17 million, as a result of the cost reduction plan executed by the management. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the changes in our general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the following reasons: (1) the increase in share-based compensation expenses of approximately US 1.63 million, due to the issuance of 0.375 million fully-vested shares of the Company s restricted common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year; (2) the decrease in other general administrative expenses of approximately US 0.43 million, as a result of the cost reduction plan executed by management; and (3) the decrease in allowance for expected credit losses of approximately US 0.77 million, respectively. 

Loss from operations: As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a loss from operations of approximately US 3.22 million and US 4.25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of approximately US 1.99 million and US 1.61 million, respectively. 

Interest Income: For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income recognized were primarily related to the interest we earned from the short-term loans we provided to unrelated parties. 

Impairment on long-term investments: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized approximately US 0.002 million in impairment loss on long-term investments, which was related to our cash investments in one of our unconsolidated investee entities whose business activities had become dormant. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized approximately US 0.21 million impairment loss on long-term investments. 

35

Change in fair value of warrant liabilities: We issued warrants in financing activities. We determined that these warrants should be accounted for as derivative liabilities, as the warrants are dominated in a currency (U.S. dollar) other than our functional currency (Renminbi or Yuan). For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not recognize any change in fair value of these warrant liabilities, compared to a gain of change in fair value of approximately US 0.19 million and US 0.01 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Loss before income tax benefit/(expense): As a result of the foregoing, our loss before income tax benefit was approximately US 2.99 million and US 4.066 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred an approximately US 1.91 million loss before income tax expense, compared with an approximately US 1.52 million loss before income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Income Tax benefit/(expense): For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized approximately US 0.004 million and nil, respectively, in income tax benefits. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized approximately nil and US 0.002 million, respectively, in income tax expenses. These benefits were related to the net operating loss incurred by one of our operating VIEs for each respective period. We anticipate these losses will likely be utilized against future earnings of this entity. 

Net loss: As a result of the foregoing, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a total net loss of approximately US 2.99 million and US 4.066 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss of approximately US 1.91 million, compared with a net loss of approximately US 1.52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

B. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash Transfer within Our Organization and the Related Restrictions 

We are a Nevada holding company with operations primarily conducted in China through our PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs subsidiaries. The intercompany flow of funds within our organization is effected through capital contributions and intercompany loans. We do not have written policies regarding intercompany cash transfer within our organization. In accordance with our current internal cash management practices, all intercompany cash transfer within our organization requires prior approval by our financial director and our chief financial officer/or our chief executive officer before execution. 

As we conduct our operations primarily in China through our PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their subsidiaries, and we intend to transfer most of our cash raised from the U.S. stock market to these operating entities to support their operations and expansions, our ability to pay dividends to U.S. investors may depend on receiving distributions from our PRC subsidiaries and settlement of the amounts owed under the VIE agreements from the consolidated VIEs. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries and the consolidated VIEs to make payments to us, or the tax implications of making payments to us, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends to our U.S. investors. 

The PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries, the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside at least 10 of their respective after-tax profit based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations each year to the statutory surplus reserve, until the balance in the reserve reaches 50 of the registered capital of the respective PRC entities. In accordance with these PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries, the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net assets restricted in the aggregate, which include paid-in capital and statutory reserve funds of our PRC subsidiaries, the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries that are included in our consolidated net assets, were approximately US 13.26 million and US 13.41 million, respectively. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund of a foreign-invested PRC entity and appropriation to the discretionary surplus reserve of other PRC entities are at the discretion of the board of directors. To date, none of our PRC subsidiaries, the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries appropriated any of these non-mandatory funds and reserves. Furthermore, if these entities incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. 

Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax EIT Law and related regulations, dividends, interests, rent or royalties payable by a foreign-invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside China are subject to a 10 withholding tax. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Hong Kong has a tax arrangement with China that provides for a 5 withholding tax on dividends subject to certain conditions and requirements, such as the requirements that the Hong Kong enterprise owns at least 25 of the PRC enterprise distributing the dividend at all times within the 12-month period immediately preceding the distribution of dividends and provides that the recipient can demonstrate it is a Hong Kong tax resident and it is the beneficial owner of the dividends. The PRC government adopted regulations in 2018 which stipulate that in determining whether a non-resident enterprise has the status as a beneficial owner, comprehensive analysis shall be conducted based on the factors listed therein and the actual circumstances of the specific case shall be taken into consideration. Specifically, it expressly excludes an agent or a designated payee from being considered as a beneficial owner . We own our PRC subsidiaries through China Net HK. China Net HK currently does not hold a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, there is no assurance that the reduced withholding tax rate will be available for us. If China Net HK is not considered to be the beneficial owner of the dividends by the Chinese local tax authority, any dividends paid to it by our PRC subsidiaries would be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10 . 

36

There are no restrictions for the consolidated VIEs to settle the amounts owed under the VIE agreements to our WFOE. However, arrangements and transactions among affiliated entities may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. If at any time the VIE agreements and the related fee structure between the consolidated VIEs and our WFOE is determined to be non-substantive and disallowed by Chinese tax authorities, the consolidated VIEs could, as a matter of last resort, make a non-deductible transfer to our WFOE for the amounts owed under the VIE agreements. This would result in such transfer being non-deductible expenses for the consolidated VIEs but still taxable income for our WFOE. If this happens, it may increase our tax burden and reduce our after-tax income in the PRC, and may materially and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to the holding company. Our management is of the view that the likelihood that this scenario would happen is remote. To date, the VIEs have settled to our WFOE the amount owed under the VIE agreements of RMB15.25 million (approximately US 2.27 million) in the aggregate. 

Our PRC subsidiaries generate all of their revenue in Renminbi, Renminbi is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends/make distributions to us. The Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Shortages in availability of foreign currency may then restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to us for us to pay dividends to the U.S. investors. Renminbi is currently convertible under the current account, which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, which includes foreign direct investment and foreign debt. Currently, our PRC subsidiaries may purchase foreign currency for settlement of current account transactions, including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China (the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. The Chinese government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and additional restrictions and substantial vetting processes may be instituted by the SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to pay dividends in foreign currencies to holders of our securities. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, the SAFE and other relevant Chinese governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our PRC subsidiaries. 

To date, none of our subsidiaries has made any distribution of earnings or issued any dividends to their respective shareholder in or outside of China, or to the Nevada holding company, and the Nevada holding company has never declared or paid any cash dividends to U.S. investors. 

We do not have any present plan to make any distribution of earnings/issue any dividends directly or indirectly to our Nevada holding company or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future because we currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. 

Cash Flow Analysis for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand and deposits held at call with banks. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately US 1.12 million. 

Our liquidity needs include (i) net cash used in operating activities that consists of (a) cash required to fund the initial build-out, continued expansion of our network and new services and (b) our working capital needs, which include deposits and advance payments to search engine resources and other advertising resources providers, payment of our operating expenses and financing of our accounts receivable; and (ii) net cash used in investing activities that consist of the investment to expand technologies related to our existing and future business activities, investment to enhance the functionality of our current advertising portals for providing advertising, marketing and data services and to secure the safety of our general network, and investment to establish joint ventures with strategic partners for the development of new technologies and services. To date, we have financed our liquidity needs primarily through proceeds we generated from financing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (1) we purchased office equipment of approximately US 0.003 million; (2) we made an additional investment of approximately US 0.002 million to one of our unconsolidated investee entities; (3) we collected US 0.49 million in short-term loan principal from short-term loans we provided to unrelated parties in previous periods; (4) we received total interest payment of approximately US 0.41 million, which was attributable to short-term loans we provided to unrelated parties in previous periods; (5) we received approximately US 0.15 million in proceeds from the disposal of long-term investments; (6) we acquired cash of approximately US 0.009 million through the acquisition of a 51 equity interest in Beijing Yi En; (7) we recognized deconsolidation of cash during the period of US 0.006 million; and (8) we made deposits on investment contracts of approximately US 0.40 million. In the aggregate, these transactions resulted in a net cash inflow from investing activities of approximately US 0.65 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, (1) we provided to an unrelated party a short-term loan of US 2.0 million. The loan is unsecured and bears a fixed annualized interest rate of 12 . The original maturity date of this loan was July 17, 2023. On July 1, 2023, we extended the term of this loan for a six-month period to January 18, 2024; (2) we collected an US 0.10 million short-term loan, which was provided to another unrelated party in April 2022; (3) we received a total interest income of approximately US 0.07 million, which was attributable to short-term loans we provided to unrelated parties in previous periods; (4) we made an additional investment of approximately US 0.04 million to one of our unconsolidated investee entities; (5) we received an approximately US 0.43 million proceeds from the disposal of our equity interest in another unconsolidated investee entity to an unrelated party; and (6) we made an deposit of approximately US0.05 million for equipment purchase. In the aggregate, these transactions resulted in a net cash outflow from investing activities of approximately US 1.50 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net cash provided by financing activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (1) we received an advance from investors of approximately US 0.81 million; and (2) we recognized capital contribution from noncontrolling interests of approximately US 0.07 million. In contrast, no cash was provided by or used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Future Liquidity, Material Cash Requirements and Capital Resources 

Our future short-term liquidity needs within 12 months from the date hereof primarily include deposits and advance payments required for the purchase of search engine marketing resources and other online marketing resources to be distributed to our customers and payments for our operating expenses, which mainly consist of office rentals and employee salary and benefit. 

In addition, in order to further develop our core business, i.e., our internet advertising and related data service business, broaden and diversify the online marketing channels for customers, reinforce our industry competitive advantage and secure our client base, we are actively seeking target companies with complementary online marketing resources for acquisition and/or joint ventures cooperation. It is not yet certain when the potential acquisition and/or cooperation will be consummated and what form(s) of consideration will be transferred by us. If this transaction were to be consummated, it will materially decrease our liquidity in the short run when the cash consideration, if any, is transferred. However, upon consummation of the acquisition, operating profits and new cash inflow may be generated from the acquired subsidiary, which may also help to improve the overall gross margin and cash flow status of our core business through the expected synergies of combining operations of the new acquired subsidiary and our own. Except this, we do not have other material non-operational cash requirements within 12 months from the date hereof. 

39

We plan to optimize our internet resources cost investment strategy to improve the gross profit margin of our core business. Additionally, we will focus on improving accounts receivables collection management and negotiating better payment terms with major suppliers. These efforts are expected to substantially boost our cash flows from operations. In addition, to further improve our liquidity, we plan to reduce our operating costs through optimizing the personnel structure among different offices, and reduce our office leasing spaces, if needed. Beginning in early 2022, we began offering our SaaS services to customers. Our SaaS services are provided based on technologies of our self-developed Blockchain Integrated Framework BIF platform, which allows clients to utilize the BIF platform as an enterprise management software to record, share and store operating data on-chain, and/or to generate unique designed Non-fungible Token NFTs for their intellectual properties and certificates. Although revenues from the new SaaS services business and its profitability have not met our expectations, we anticipate that it will generate positive cash flow and improve our liquidity. This is because these services leverage our self-developed software platform, which does not require significant cash outflow to third-party service providers. 

In addition, for the next 12 months from the date hereof, we anticipate to generate additional cash inflows and/or improve our liquidity through the following: (1) our current outstanding short-term working capital loans provided to unrelated parties will mature within the next 12 months that we anticipate collecting these loan principals and the related interest income within the next 12 months; (2) if at any time we anticipate insufficiency of our working capital, we can apply for revolving credit facility from commercial banks in the PRC to supplement our short-term liquidity deficit. We have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining such credit facility before, and this could result in fixed obligations and incremental cost of interest; (3) in consideration of the long-term cooperation history and good track records with our major suppliers, we plan to negotiate with our suppliers for more favorable payment terms; and (4) we plan to reduce our operating costs through optimizing the personnel structure among different offices and reduce our office leasing spaces, if needed. This may incur incremental costs related to employee layoff compensation and contract termination penalty. 

If we fail to achieve these goals, we may need additional financing to execute our business plan. If additional financing is required, we cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are not available, or that we are unsuccessful in increasing our gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, we may be unable to implement our current plans for expansion, repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our uncertain ability to increase gross profit margin and reduce operating loss from our core business and/or obtain additional equity and/or debt financing. The accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2024 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on the financial statements. 

In the long term, beyond the next 12 months, we plan to further broaden the application scenarios of our blockchain-based SaaS services to be offered to the customers, continue expanding our core Internet advertising and marketing business through acquisitions, and develop Internet advertising and marketing channels that target overseas Internet users. As such, we may decide to enhance our liquidity position or increase our cash reserve for future investments through additional equity financing in the U.S. capital market. This would result in further dilution to our shareholders. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

C. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

D. Disclosure of Contractual Obligations 

In June 2023, we acquired a 9.9 equity interest in Wuhan Ju Liang, through subscription of a RMB0.99 million (approximately US 0.14 million) in registered capital of the entity in cash, which amount was committed to be paid up before August 1, 2052.
