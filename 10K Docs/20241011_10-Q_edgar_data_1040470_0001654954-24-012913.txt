The restricted stock issued to the shareholders of Incal is subject to a six-month holding period, during which time the shares cannot be transferred or sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an available exemption. The fair value of the restricted shares was determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the acquisition date, adjusted for a discount related to the lack of marketability due to the transfer restrictions. The total fair value of the restricted shares issued as part of the consideration was million. The escrow payable of million represents the present value of two components: (1) . The escrow payable will be settled with cash of million held in an escrow account for working capital adjustments and potential indemnification obligations in connection with the acquisition of Incal. Of the million cash restricted in escrow, million is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and million is included in Other noncurrent assets. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: Accounts receivable Inventory Goodwill Property and equipment Intangible assets Operating lease right-of-use assets Other assets, current and noncurrent Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and noncurrent Deferred revenue Operating lease liabilities, current and noncurrent Deferred tax liabilities, net Total The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and will not be deductible for income tax purposes. 10 Table of Contents Trade names Customer relationships Non-compete agreements and others - Total intangible assets acquired Acquisition-related costs were million during the three months ended August 30, 2024, and were expensed in the period incurred within selling, general and administrative expense in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations include million in revenue and million in net loss contributed by Incal from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented, as the financial impact to the Company s consolidated results of operations is not material. The purchase consideration allocation is preliminary, and as additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise it during the remainder of the measurement period. Total The following table represents the Company s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2024, and the basis for that measurement: Total 11 Table of Contents million restricted cash representing a security deposit for the Company s United States manufacturing and office space lease. There were no financial liabilities measured at fair value as of August 30, 2024 and May 31, 2024. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three months ended August 30, 2024. The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain other accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Work in process Finished goods Property and equipment Property and equipment, net consisted of the following: Machinery and equipment - Test equipment - Furniture and fixtures - Less: accumulated depreciation Lesser of estimated useful life or lease term. Depreciation expense was million for the three months ended August 30, 2024 and million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Product warranties The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized on the products shipped. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Company s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The standard warranty period is one year for systems and ninety days for parts and service. 12 Table of Contents Accruals for warranties issued during the period Consumption of reserves Balance at the end of the period The accrued warranty balance is included in accrued expenses on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred revenue Deferred revenue, short-term consisted of the following: Deferred revenue Addition due to business combination Balance as of August 30, 2024 Purchased Intangible Assets The Company s purchased intangible assets, net, were as follows: Trade names Customer relationships Non-compete agreements and others Total Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets with finite lives was million for the three months ended August 30, 2024. 13 Table of Contents 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total Provision for income taxes Effective tax rate The Company s effective tax rate varies from the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to the R D credits available to apply against federal and California income and the tax expense from stock-based compensation. During interim periods, tax expenses are accrued for jurisdictions that are anticipated to be profitable for fiscal 2025. The determination of income taxes for the three months ended August 30, 2024 and August 31, 2023 was based on the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate. Tax expense for the three months ended August 30, 2024 was primarily due to tax expense related to U.S. and profitable foreign subsidiaries. Tax expense for the three months ended August 31, 2023 was primarily due to profitable foreign subsidiaries. Provision for income taxes for the three months ended August 31, 2023 did not included tax expense related to U.S. operations due to a valuation allowance. The Company maintained a full valuation allowance on all the U.S. net deferred tax assets through the first nine months of fiscal 2024. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company concluded that the valuation allowance related to the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer required due to existence of sufficient positive evidence to support that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets are realizable. A significant income tax benefit of 21.9 million was recognized due to release of a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As of August 30, 2024, deferred tax assets, net decreased million to million from million at May 31, 2024 primarily due to the intangible assets acquired from Incal through a common stock acquisition, which created a deferred tax liability. None of the intangible assets are expected to be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes since the transaction for income tax purposes is treated as a stock acquisition, rather than an asset acquisition for financial accounting purposes. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions consistent with authoritative guidance. The guidance prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes. 14 Table of Contents million shelf registration. A Registration Statement on Form S-3 was filed with the SEC on September 3, 2021. A Prospectus Supplement for an At the Market ATM sale of million of common stock was subsequently filed on September 17, 2021. The Company sold shares of common stock at an average selling price of per share between September and October 2021. The gross proceeds to the Company were .0 million, before commission fees of million and offering expenses of million. Another Prospectus Supplement for an ATM sale of 25 million of common stock was subsequently filed on February 8, 2023. The Company sold shares of common stock at an average selling price of per share in February 2023. The gross proceeds to the Company during the quarter ended February 28, 2023 were million, before commissions of million and offering expenses of million. No proceeds were raised from the ATM during the three months ended August 30, 2024 and August 31, 2023. As of August 30, 2024, the remaining amount of the ATM offering was million. Subsequently, the registration statement expired in September 2024. 15 Table of Contents United States Europe Contactors Services With the exception of the amount of service contracts and extended warranties, the Company s product net revenues are recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. The following presents net revenues based on timing of recognition: Services transferred over time Contract balances Accounts receivable are recognized in the period the Company delivers goods or provides services and when the Company s right to consideration is unconditional. Contract assets include unbilled receivables which represent revenues that are earned in advance of scheduled billings to customers. These amounts are primarily related to product sales where transfer of control has occurred but the Company has not yet invoiced. As of August 30, 2024 and May 31, 2024, unbilled receivables were million and million, respectively, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under a contract and are satisfied as the associated revenue is recognized. Contract liabilities as of August 30, 2024 and May 31, 2024 were million and million, respectively, and were included in deferred revenue, short-term and deferred revenue, long-term on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended August 30, 2024, the Company recognized million in revenue which were included in contract liabilities as of May 31, 2024. Remaining performance obligations As of August 30, 2024, the remaining performance obligations, exclusive of customer deposits, which were comprised of deferred service contracts and extended warranty contracts not yet delivered, are not material. The foregoing excludes the value of other remaining performance obligations, as they have original durations of one year or less and excludes information about variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses as the amortization period is typically less than one year. Additionally, the majority of the Company s cost of fulfillment as a manufacturer of products is classified as inventory and fixed assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for those asset types. Other costs of contract fulfillment are immaterial due to the nature of the Company s products and their respective manufacturing process. 16 Table of Contents Research and development Selling, general and administrative Stock-based compensation expense totaling million and million was capitalized as part of inventory as of August 30, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. The Company s nonvested RSU, PRSU and restricted shares activities during the three months ended August 30, 2024 were as follows: Granted (1) Vested Forfeited - Unvested, August 30, 2024 (1) Includes performance-based awards, of which performance-based awards have target achievement goals whereby the grantee can earn up to 200 of the original award (up to shares) if the maximum target goals are met.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, could, should, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential , target or continue, the negative effect of terms like these or other similar expressions. Any statement concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible actions taken by us or our subsidiaries, which may be provided by us are also forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date of filing and we further caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risk factors set forth in Item 1. Business and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 30, 2024. All references to we , us , our , Aehr Test , Aehr Test Systems or the Company refer to Aehr Test Systems. Overview We are a leading provider of test solutions for testing, burning-in, and stabilizing semiconductor devices in wafer level, singulated die, and package part form, and have installed thousands of systems worldwide. Decarbonization and digitalization is driving increased quality, reliability, safety, and security needs of semiconductors used across multiple applications, including electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, solar and wind power, computing, data and telecommunications infrastructure, and solid-state memory and storage. The trend is driving additional test requirements, incremental capacity needs, and new opportunities for our test products and solutions. We have developed and introduced several innovative products including the FOX-P family of test and burn-in systems and FOX WaferPak Aligner, FOX WaferPak Contactor, FOX DiePak Carrier and FOX DiePak Loader. The FOX-XP and FOX-NP systems are full wafer contact and singulated die/module test and burn-in systems that can test, burn-in, and stabilize a wide range of devices such as leading-edge silicon carbide-based and other power semiconductors, 2D and 3D sensors used in mobile phones, tablets, and other computing devices, memory semiconductors, processors, microcontrollers, systems-on-a-chip, and photonics and integrated optical devices used in artificial intelligence. The FOX-CP system is a low-cost single-wafer compact test solution for logic, memory and photonic devices and the newest addition to the FOX-P product family. The FOX WaferPak Contactor contains a unique full wafer contactor capable of testing wafers up to 300mm that enables Integrated Circuit manufacturers to perform test, burn-in, and stabilization of full wafers on the FOX-P systems. The FOX DiePak Carrier allows testing, burning in, and stabilization of singulated bare die and modules up to 1,024 devices in parallel per DiePak on the FOX-NP and FOX-XP systems up to nine DiePaks at a time. Our net revenue consists primarily of sales of FOX-P systems, WaferPak Aligners and DiePak Loaders, WaferPak contactors, DiePak carriers, test fixtures, upgrades and spare parts, service contracts revenues, and non-recurring engineering charges. Our selling arrangements may include contractual customer acceptance provisions, which are mostly deemed perfunctory or inconsequential, and installation of the product occurs after shipment, transfer of title and risk of loss. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to customer programs and incentives, inventories, and income taxes. Our estimates are derived from historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Those results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a discussion of the critical accounting policies, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. 19 Table of Contents Except for the critical accounting estimates related to Business Combination and Impairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets newly discussed below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended August 30, 2024 compared to those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. Business Combinations Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The assumptions and estimates are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales, customer orders and acquired technologies, estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology-related intangible assets, and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Impairment of Goodwill We assess goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment. We may first evaluate qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and to determine if an impairment test is necessary. We may choose to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test, bypassing the initial qualitative assessment. The quantitative test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A goodwill impairment loss would be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Impairments of Long-Lived Assets We monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses, or a projection of continuing losses, or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates, to the carrying value of the assets. If we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value. Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. We have not recorded any impairment charges during the three months ended August 30, 2024 and August 31, 2023. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Beginning on June 1, 2024, we have changed our fiscal year to the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest May 31. Our first fiscal quarter in fiscal 2025 ended on August 30, 2024, and our fiscal year 2025 will end on May 30, 2025. Impact of Acquisition We completed the acquisition of Incal Technology, Inc. Incal on July 31, 2024. Revenue from the acquired products and services subsequent to the acquisition date was not material to our results of operations for the three months ended August 30, 2024. However, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of the expense contributions from the acquisition where such discussions are significant to understanding our financial results. 20 Table of Contents Discussion of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended August 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2023 Revenues Revenue by Category Three Months Ended August 30, August 31, Percent (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Products 12,154 19,357 (37 Services 965 1,267 (24 Total revenues 13,119 20,624 (36 Products as a percentage of total revenues 92.6 93.9 Services as a percentage of total revenues 7.4 6.1 Revenue decreased to 13.1 million for the three months ended August 30, 2024 from 20.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, driven by a decrease in shipments of our systems and services due to the recent overall softness in the demand for electric vehicles. Our systems revenue decreased by 8.0 million and our services revenue decreased by 0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in our contactors revenue of 0.8 million. Revenue by Geography Three Months Ended August 30, August 31, Percent (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Asia 12,578 19,231 (35 United States 523 789 (34 Europe 18 604 (97 Total revenues 13,119 20,624 (36 Asia as a percentage of total revenues 95.9 93.3 United States as a percentage of total revenues 4.0 3.8 Europe as a percentage of total revenues 0.1 2.9 On a geographic basis, revenues represent products that were shipped to or services that were performed at our customer locations. For the three months ended August 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, revenue decreased across all regions, primarily due to a decline in shipments of our systems driven by the recent overall softness in the demand for electric vehicles. Gross Margin Gross Profit by Category Three Months Ended August 30, August 31, Percent (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Products 6,736 9,438 (29 Services 342 543 (37 Gross profit 7,078 9,981 (29 Gross Margin by Category Product 55.4 48.8 Services 35.4 42.9 Gross margin 54.0 48.4 Gross profit decreased to 7.1 million for the three months ended August 30, 2024 from 10.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Gross margin increased to 54.0 for the three months ended August 30, 2024 from 48.4 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in gross margin of 5.6 percentage points was primarily due to a decrease in material cost as a percentage of revenue driven by a product mix shift toward more contactor sales. This was partially offset by lower system shipments resulting in lower manufacturing efficiencies. 21 Table of Contents Research and Development Three Months Ended August 30, August 31, Percent (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Research and development 2,361 2,457 (4 As a percentage of total revenues 18.0 11.9 Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for product development personnel, outside development service costs, travel expenses, facilities cost allocations, and stock-based compensation charges.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 4.6 million for the three months ended August 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 0.5 million in acquisition related costs, and 0.4 million in additional expenses from the newly acquired business.

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased for the three months ended August 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest income earned due to higher yields from our investments in money market funds.

The 1.5 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended August 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, was driven primarily by a lower net income, a decrease in cash provided by deferred revenue due to timing of customer deposits and revenue recognition, a decrease in cash provided by collection of accounts receivable due to the lower revenue and an increase in cash used in prepaid expenses, partially offset by a decrease in cash used in inventory production due to anticipated lower customer demand. Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities decreased by 28.5 million for the three months ended August 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of our short-term investments of 18.0 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023, while there was no such maturity of investment during the three months ended August 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company paid 10.6 million to acquire Incal during the three months ended August 30, 2024. Net Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 0.6 million for the three months ended August 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock units. Off-Balance Sheet Agreements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. There have been no material changes in the composition, magnitude or other key characteristics of our contractual obligations or other commitments as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024. 23 Table of Contents Item 3.
