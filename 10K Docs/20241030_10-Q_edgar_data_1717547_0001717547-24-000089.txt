 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expects, intends, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, or potential or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and may cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. 
 Among others, the following uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: 
 operating costs and business disruption may be greater than expected; 
 the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as changes in consumer behavior and corporate policies that have affected the use of and demand for traditional retail, hotel and office space; 
 we depend on borrowers and tenants for a substantial portion of our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue and our ability to make distributions to stockholders will be dependent upon the success and economic viability of such borrowers and tenants; 
 higher interest rates may adversely impact the value of our variable-rate investments, resulting in higher interest expense, materially impacting our borrowers ability to refinance existing loans, and creating disruptions to our borrowers and tenants ability to finance their activities, on whom we depend for a substantial portion of our revenue; 
 lower interest rates may materially impact earnings as a result of generating less income on our loans and our ability to redeploy funds in a timely manner or to supplement earnings loss; 
 deterioration in the performance of the properties securing our investments (including depletion of interest and other reserves or payment-in-kind concessions in lieu of current interest payment obligations , population shifts and migration, or reduced demand for office, multifamily, hospitality or retail space) may cause deterioration in the performance of our investments and, potentially, principal losses to us; 
 the fair value of our investments may be subject to uncertainties including impacts associated with inflation, volatility of interest rates and, credit spreads and the transition from LIBOR to SOFR, and increased market volatility affecting commercial real estate businesses and public securities; 
 our use of leverage and interest rate mismatches between our assets and borrowings could hinder our ability to make distributions and may significantly impact our liquidity position; 
 the ability to realize expected returns on equity and/or yields on investments; 
 adverse impacts on our corporate revolver, including covenant compliance and borrowing base capacity; 
 adverse impacts on our liquidity, including available capacity under and margin calls on master repurchase facilities, debt service or lease payment defaults or deferrals, demands for protective advances and capital expenditures; 
 our real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions, which may result in losses to us; 
 our inability to refinance existing mortgage debt on our real estate portfolio; 
 the timing of and ability to deploy available capital; 
 our lack of an established minimum distribution payment level, and whether we can continue to pay distributions in the future; 
 the timing of and ability to complete repurchases of our common stock; 
 the risks associated with obtaining mortgage financing on our real estate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders; 
 the impact of legislative, regulatory, tax and competitive changes, regime changes and the actions of governmental authorities, and in particular those affecting the commercial real estate finance and mortgage industry or our business; and 
 the ongoing impacts of global geopolitical uncertainty and unforeseen public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the real estate market. 
 The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive, and many of these risks are heightened as a result of the numerous adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We urge you to carefully review the disclosures we make concerning risks in the sections entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.

 million. If the borrower did not fund such deposit by June 2024, the Company had discretion to fund such amounts on behalf of the borrower through a preferred equity investment in the parent of the borrower. If the Company elected to fund any amount, it may also elect to trigger control rights over the underlying collateral. The Company concluded that as a result of the loan modification, its investment in the Arlington, Texas multifamily loan is a VIE. In June 2024, the borrower did not fund the deposit into the controlled reserve account. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company funded certain amounts pursuant to the preferred equity investment. As of the date of the initial funding, the Company became the primary beneficiary of the VIE as the Company has the ability to control the most significant activities of the Arlington, Texas multifamily loan s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. As a result, the Company consolidated the assets and liabilities of the VIE as well as the operations of the Arlington, Texas multifamily property during the third quarter of 2024 and it is included in real estate, net on its consolidated balance sheets. The loan and preferred equity held for investment related to the Arlington, Texas multifamily loan are eliminated in consolidation. The consolidation did not result in a gain or loss. See Note 3, Loans Held for Investment, net and Note 4, Real Estate, net and Real Estate Held for Sale for further information. 
 Voting Interest Entities Unlike VIEs, voting interest entities have sufficient equity to finance their activities and equity investors exhibit the characteristics of a controlling financial interest through their voting rights. The Company consolidates such entities when it has the power to control these entities through ownership of a majority of the entities voting interests or through other arrangements. 
 At each reporting period, the Company reassesses whether changes in facts and circumstances cause a change in the status of an entity as a VIE or voting interest entity, and/or a change in the Company s consolidation assessment. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has identified certain consolidated VIEs. Assets of each of the VIEs, other than the OP, may only be used to settle obligations of the respective VIE. Creditors of each of the VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the Company. 
 Consolidated VIEs 
 Consolidated VIEs include the Investing VIEs (as defined and discussed below), the Arlington, Texas multifamily loan and certain operating real estate properties that have noncontrolling interests. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the

 to . These noncontrolling interests do not have substantive kick-out nor participating rights. 
 Investing VIEs 
 The Company s previous investments in securitization financing entities Investing VIEs included subordinate first-loss tranches of securitization trusts, which represented interests in such VIEs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not hold any tranches of any securitization trusts, with the exception of its securitization bonds payable, net.

 Impairment The Company evaluates its real estate held for investment for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

 property as held for sale. At December 31, 2023, the Company classified property as held for sale. Refer to Note 4, Real Estate, net and Real Estate Held for Sale and Note 12, Fair Value for further detail. 
 Foreclosed Properties 
 The Company receives foreclosed properties in full or partial settlement of loans held for investment by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. Foreclosed properties are generally recognized at the time the real estate is received at foreclosure sale or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed properties are initially measured at fair value. If the fair value of the property is lower than the carrying value of the loan, the difference is recognized as CECL reserves and the cumulative reserve on the loan is charged off. Fair value of foreclosed properties is generally based on a discounted cash flow, third party appraisals, broker price opinions, comparable sales or a combination thereof.

 Loan Modifications 
 The Company may amend or modify a loan depending on the loan s specific facts and circumstances. These loan modifications typically include additional time for the borrower to refinance or sell the collateral property, adjustment or waiver of performance tests that are prerequisite to the extension of a loan s maturity, and/or deferral of scheduled principal payments.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had million of unpaid principal balance of CRE debt investments financed with BRSP 2021-FL1. As of September 30, 2024, the securitization reflects an advance rate of at a weighted average cost of funds of Term SOFR plus (before transaction costs), and is collateralized by a pool of senior loan investments. 
 Additionally, BRSP 2021-FL1 contains note protection tests that can be triggered as a result of contributed loan defaults, losses, and certain other events outlined in the indenture, beyond established thresholds. A note protection test failure that is not remedied can result in the redirection of interest proceeds from the below investment grade tranches to amortize the most senior outstanding tranche. The Company did not fail any note protection tests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. While the Company continues to closely monitor all loan investments contributed to BRSP 2021-FL1, a deterioration in the performance of an underlying loan could negatively impact its liquidity position. 
 BRSP 2024-FL2 
 In August 2024, the Company executed a million securitization transaction through wholly-owned subsidiaries, BRSP 2024-FL2, Ltd. and BRSP 2024-FL2, LLC (collectively, BRSP 2024-FL2 ), which resulted in the sale of million of investment grade notes (the 2024-FL2 Notes ). 
 BRSP 2024-FL2 includes a six-month ramp-up acquisition period that allows the Company to contribute existing or newly originated loan investments in exchange for million in unused proceeds held in BRSP 2024-FL2, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture. BRSP 2024-FL2 also includes a reinvestment feature that allows the Company to contribute existing or newly originated loan investments in exchange for proceeds from repayments of loans held in BRSP 2024-FL2, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture. As of September 30, 2024, the securitization reflects an advance rate of at a weighted average cost of funds of Term SOFR plus (before transaction costs), and is collateralized by a pool of senior loan investments and cash. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, loan held in BRSP 2024-FL2 was fully repaid, totaling million. The Company will replace the repaid loan by contributing existing or newly originated loan investments of equal value.

Significant increases or decreases in any one of the inputs described above in isolation may result in significantly different fair value of the financial assets and liabilities using such Level 3 inputs. 
 Fair Value Option 
 The Company may elect to apply the fair value option of accounting for certain of its financial assets or liabilities due to the nature of the instrument at the time of the initial recognition of the investment. The Company elected the fair value option for PE Investments because management believes it is a more useful presentation for such investments. The Company determined recording the PE Investments based on the change in fair value of projected future cash flow from one period to another better represents the underlying economics of the respective investment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has elected not to apply the fair value option for any other eligible financial assets or liabilities. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 In addition to the above disclosures regarding financial assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value, GAAP requires disclosure of fair value about all financial instruments. The following disclosure of estimated fair value of financial instruments was determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, which are included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, as well as the information contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov . 
 
 Introduction 
 We are a commercial real estate CRE credit real estate investment trust REIT focused on originating, acquiring, financing and managing a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of CRE debt investments and net leased properties predominantly in the United States. CRE debt investments primarily consist of first mortgage loans, which is our primary investment strategy. Additionally, we may also selectively originate mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments, which may include profit participations. The mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments may be in conjunction with our origination of corresponding first mortgages on the same properties. Net leased properties consist of CRE properties with long-term leases to tenants on a net-lease basis, where such tenants generally will be responsible for property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, maintenance capital expenditures and real estate taxes. We continue to target net leased equity investments on a selective basis. 
 We were organized in the state of Maryland on August 23, 2017 and maintain key offices in New York, New York and Los Angeles, California. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. We conduct all our activities and hold substantially all our assets and liabilities through our operating subsidiary, BrightSpire Capital Operating Company, LLC (the OP ). 
 Our Target Assets 
 Our investment strategy is to originate and selectively acquire our target assets, which consist of the following: 
 Senior Loans. Our primary focus is originating and selectively acquiring senior loans that are backed by CRE assets. These loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on a commercial property and provide mortgage financing to a commercial property developer or owner. The loans may vary in duration, bear interest at a fixed or floating rate and amortize, if at all, over varying periods, often with a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Senior loans may include junior participations in our originated senior loans for which we have syndicated the senior participations to other investors and retained the junior participations for our portfolio. We believe these junior participations are more like the senior loans we originate than other loan types given their credit quality and risk profile. 
 Mezzanine Loans. We may originate or acquire mezzanine loans, which are structurally subordinate to senior loans, but senior to the borrower s equity position. Generally, we will originate or acquire these loans if we believe we have the ability to protect our position and fund the first mortgage, if necessary. Mezzanine loans may be structured such that our return accrues and is added to the principal amount rather than paid on a current basis. We may also pursue equity participation opportunities in instances when the risk-reward characteristics of the investment warrant additional upside participation in the possible appreciation in value of the underlying assets securing the investment. 
 Preferred Equity. We may make investments that are subordinate to senior and mezzanine loans, but senior to the common equity in the mortgage borrower. Preferred equity investments may be structured such that our return accrues and is added to the principal amount rather than paid on a current basis. We also may pursue equity participation opportunities in preferred equity investments, like such participations in mezzanine loans. 
 Net Leased and Other Real Estate. We may occasionally invest directly in well-located commercial real estate with long-term leases to tenants on a net lease basis, where such tenants generally will be responsible for property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, maintenance capital expenditures and real estate taxes. In addition, tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), (2) fixed increases, or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term, net lease agreements generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income. 
 Our operating segments are Senior and Mezzanine Loans and Preferred Equity and Net Leased and Other Real Estate, both of which are included in our target assets, and Corporate and Other. 
 The allocation of our capital among our target assets will depend on prevailing market conditions at the time we invest and may change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions. In addition, in the future, we may invest in assets other than our target assets or change our target assets. With respect to all our investments, we invest so as to maintain our

 qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exclusion or exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). 
 We believe that events in the financial markets from time to time, including the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, have created and will continue to create dislocation between price and intrinsic value in certain asset classes as well as a supply and demand imbalance of available credit to finance these assets. We believe that our in-depth understanding of CRE and real estate-related investments, in-house underwriting, asset management and resolution capabilities, provides an extensive platform to regularly evaluate our investments and determine primary, secondary or alternative disposition strategies. This includes intermediate servicing and negotiating, restructuring of non-performing investments, foreclosure considerations, management or development of owned real estate, in each case to reposition and achieve optimal value realization for us and our stockholders. Depending on the nature of the underlying investment, we may pursue repositioning strategies through judicious capital investment in order to extract maximum value from the investment or recognize unanticipated losses to reinvest resulting liquidity in higher-yielding performing investments. 
 We have gained enough visibility into liquidity whereby we have re-engaged with the market on loan originations. While it is still early in the process, we are actively reviewing opportunities. We recognize that continuing to resolve risk rated 4 and 5 loans and real estate owned properties is paramount and remains our priority. 
 Our Business Segments 
 We present our business as one portfolio through the following business segments: 
 Senior and Mezzanine Loans and Preferred Equity CRE debt investments including senior and mezzanine loans, and preferred equity interests as well as participations in such loans. 
 Net Leased and Other Real Estate direct investments in commercial real estate with long-term leases to tenants on a net lease basis, where such tenants generally will be responsible for property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, maintenance, capital expenditures and real estate taxes. It also includes other real estate, currently consisting of two investments with direct ownership in commercial real estate, with an emphasis on properties with stable cash flow, four additional properties that we acquired through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and one property that we consolidate as the primary beneficiary. 
 Corporate and Other includes corporate-level asset management and other fees including expenses related to our secured revolving credit facility (the Bank Credit Facility and compensation and benefits. It also includes a sub-portfolio of private equity funds. 
 
 Significant Developments 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and through October 29, 2024, significant developments affecting our business and results of operations of our portfolio included the following: 
 Capital Resources 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we executed a 675.0 million securitization transaction through BRSP 2024-FL2 (as defined below), contributing 22 senior floating-rate mortgages secured by 25 properties, totaling 590.2 million, which resulted in the sale of 583.9 million of investment grade notes (the 2024-FL2 Notes ). The transaction also features a two-year reinvestment period and available proceeds of 84.8 million to be used within a six-month ramp-up acquisition period from closing. The securitization reflects an initial advance rate of 86.5 at a weighted cost of funds of Term SOFR plus 2.47 (before transaction costs). See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion; 
 On August 19, 2024, we redeemed the outstanding securities under CLNC 2019-FL1, including the investment grade notes issued thereunder (the 2019-FL1 Notes ), at a redemption price of 311.6 million. The 14 senior loan investments, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of 477.7 million, held by CLNC 2019-FL1 (as defined below) were refinanced by the issuance of the securities under BRSP 2024-FL2, including the 2024-FL2 Notes, and with an existing Master Repurchase Facility; 
 Repurchased 1.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at a weighted average price of 5.52 for an aggregate cost of 6.6 million; 
 As of the date of this report, we have approximately 416.0 million of liquidity, consisting of 251.0 million cash and cash equivalents on hand and 165.0 million available on our Bank Credit Facility; and 
 Declared and paid a third quarter dividend of 0.16 per share on October 15, 2024.

 Our Portfolio 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we: 
 Received loan repayment proceeds of 126.6 million from ten loans; 
 Recorded a net decrease in our general CECL reserves of 16.1 million. At September 30, 2024, our general CECL reserve for our outstanding loans and future loan funding commitments is 155.7 million, which is 5.78 of the aggregate commitment amount of our loan portfolio. We also recorded total specific CECL reserves of 9.1 million related to two multifamily loans which were subsequently charged off during the quarter following repayment. We have no specific CECL reserve at September 30, 2024; 
 Reduced the total number of watchlist loans (loans with a risk ranking of 4 or 5) by three (refer to Our Portfolio for further discussion): 
 Removed four loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of 128.8 million; 
 Added one loan with an unpaid principal balance of 39.8 million; 
 Extended 25 loans eligible for certain maturity events, which represent 680.1 million of unpaid principal balance at September 30, 2024; 
 Sold one office property and received net proceeds of 19.1 million and recognized a realized gain of 0.1 million; and 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we: 
 Originated one senior mortgage loan with a total commitment of 26.5 million, initial funding of 19.9 million a spread of SOFR plus 3.65 . 
 Financial Results 
 Generated GAAP net income of 12.7 million, or 0.10 per basic and 0.09 per diluted share, Distributable Earnings of 17.9 million, or 0.14 per share and Adjusted Distributable Earnings of 27.0 million or 0.21 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to net income/(loss) attributable to the Company s common stockholders is in the section Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures below. 
 
 Trends Affecting Our Business 
 Global Markets 
 Although global markets showed signs of stabilization and inflationary pressure may be moderating due to increased interest rates through the end of 2023, CRE value uncertainties, aftershock of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical unrest continue to contribute to market volatility. Generationally high interest rates have continued to negatively impact transaction activity in the real estate market and correspondingly the loan financing and refinancing opportunities. While the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in the second half of 2024, it is uncertain as to when, how many and by how much subsequent interest rate cuts will be made. To the extent certain of our borrowers are experiencing significant financial dislocation as a result of economic conditions, we have and may continue to use interest and other reserves and/or replenishment obligations of the borrower and/or guarantors to meet current interest payment obligations for a limited period. The market for office properties was particularly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to experience headwinds driven by the normalization of work from home and hybrid work arrangements and elevated costs to operate or reconfigure office properties. Although return to office mandates are on the rise, the demand for office space generally remains lower than pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels and has driven rising vacancy rates. Given the continuing uncertainty in the office market, there is risk of future valuation impairment or investment loss on our loans secured by office properties. Similarly, these trends may impact our ability to manage debt covenant tests, maturity dates and/or seek suitable refinancing opportunities on certain of our office property equity investments, which may adversely impact valuation assessments and cash flow generated by such investments. 
 While macroeconomic conditions continue to be challenged, we cannot predict whether they will in fact improve or even intensify. Due to the inherent uncertainty of these conditions, their impact on our business is difficult to predict and quantify. 
 Factors Impacting Our Operating Results 
 Our results of operations are affected by a number of factors and depend primarily on, among other things, the ability of the borrowers of our assets to service our debt as it is due and payable, the ability of our tenants to pay rent and other amounts due under their leases, our ability to actively and effectively service any sub-performing and non-performing loans and other assets we may have from time to time in our portfolio, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, CRE senior loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities, net leased properties and our other assets, and the level of our net operating income NOI ). Our net interest income, which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of purchase discounts, varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, prepayment rates and frequency on our CRE loans and the ability of our borrowers to make scheduled interest payments. Interest rates and prepayment rates vary according 

55 

Table of Contents 

 to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our net property operating income depends on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of our real estate equity investments, lease currently available space and continue to attract new tenants. 
 Changes in fair value of our assets 
 We consider and treat our assets as long-term investments. As a result, we do not expect that changes in market value will impact our operating results. However, at least on a quarterly basis, we assess both our ability and intent to hold such assets for the long-term. As part of this process, we monitor our assets for impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of our assets, which includes the inability to modify, extend or refinance existing mortgage debt on our real estate portfolio, may result in our recognizing an impairment charge or realizing losses upon the sale of such investments. 
 Changes in market interest rates 
 With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: 
 the value of our fixed-rate investments to decrease; 
 prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; 
 coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; 
 interest rate caps required by our borrowers to increase in cost; 
 borrowers unwillingness to purchase new interest rate caps at loan maturity to qualify for an extension; 
 financial hardship to our borrowers, whose ability to service their debt as it is due and payable and to pass maturity extension tests may be materially adversely impacted, resulting in foreclosures; 
 to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; and 
 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to increase. 
 Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: 
 the value of the fixed-rate assets in our portfolio to increase; 
 prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; 
 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease; 
 coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; and 
 to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease. 
 Credit risk 
 We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target assets. We seek to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets, at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses and by employing a comprehensive review and asset selection process and by careful ongoing monitoring of acquired assets. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 Size of investment portfolio 
 The size of our portfolio, as measured by the aggregate principal balance of our commercial mortgage loans, other commercial real estate-related debt investments and the other assets we own, is also a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we earn increases. However, a larger portfolio may result in increased expenses to the extent that we incur additional interest expense to finance our assets.

 Underwriting Process 
 We use an investment and underwriting process that has been developed by our senior management team leveraging their extensive commercial real estate expertise over many years and real estate cycles. The underwriting process focuses on some or all of the following factors designed to ensure each investment is evaluated appropriately: (i) macroeconomic conditions that may influence operating performance; (ii) fundamental analysis of underlying real estate, including tenant rosters, lease terms, zoning, necessary licensing, operating costs and the asset s overall competitive position in its market; (iii) real estate market factors that may influence the economic performance of the investment, including leasing conditions and overall competition; (iv) the operating expertise and financial strength and reputation of a tenant, operator, partner or borrower; (v) the cash flow in place and projected to be in place over the term of the investment and potential return; (vi) the appropriateness of the business plan and estimated costs associated with tenant buildout, repositioning or capital improvements; (vii) an internal and third-party valuation of a property, investment basis relative to the competitive set and the ability to liquidate an investment through a sale or refinancing; (viii) review of third-party reports including appraisals, engineering and environmental reports; (ix) physical inspections of properties and markets; (x) the overall legal structure of the investment, contractual implications and the lenders rights; and (xi) the tax and accounting impact. 
 Loan Risk Rankings 
 In addition to reviewing loans held for investment for impairment quarterly, we evaluate loans held for investment to determine if a current expected credit losses reserve should be established. In conjunction with this review, we assess the risk factors of each senior and mezzanine loan and assign a risk ranking based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, underlying real estate performance and asset value, values of comparable properties, durability and quality of property cash flows, sponsor experience and financial wherewithal, and the existence of a risk-mitigating loan structure. Additional key considerations include loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, loan structure, real estate and credit market dynamics, and risk of default or principal loss. Based on a five-point scale, our loans held for investment are rated 1 through 5, from less risk to greater risk. At the time of origination or purchase, loans held for investment are ranked as a 3 and will move accordingly going forward based on the ratings which are defined as follows: 
 1. Very Low Risk 
 2. Low Risk 
 3. Medium Risk 

57 

Table of Contents 

 4. High Risk/Potential for Loss A loan that has a high risk of realizing a principal loss. 
 5. Impaired/Loss Likely A loan that has a very high risk of realizing a principal loss or has otherwise incurred a principal loss. 
 At September 30, 2024, our weighted average risk ranking remained unchanged at 3.2 compared to June 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we had the following risk ranking activity for risk ranked 4 and 5 assets: 
 Repayments: two multifamily loans with risk rankings of 4 were resolved; 
 Upgrades: one multifamily loan was upgraded to a risk ranking of 3 from a risk ranking of 4; 
 Downgrades: one multifamily loan was downgraded to a risk ranking of 5 from a risk ranking of 4 and another multifamily loan was downgraded to a risk ranking of 4 from a risk ranking of 3; 
 Other: one multifamily loan with a risk ranking of 4 was consolidated as real estate and removed from loans held for investment, net.

 At September 30, 2024, our general CECL reserve for our outstanding loans and future loan funding commitments is 155.7 million, which is 5.78 of the aggregate commitment amount of our loan portfolio. This represents a decrease of 16.1 million from 171.8 million or 5.97 of the aggregate commitment amount of our loan portfolio at June 30, 2024. The decrease in our general CECL reserve was primarily driven by risk ranked 4 loan repayments as well as the charge-off of reserves for the consolidation of a multifamily loan in Arlington, Texas. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded total specific CECL reserves of 9.1 million related to two multifamily loans which were subsequently charged off during the quarter following repayment of both loans. As a result, we have no specific CECL reserve at September 30, 2024. 
 Net Leased and Other Real Estate 
 Our net leased real estate investment strategy focuses on direct ownership in commercial real estate with an emphasis on properties with stable cash flow, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner s equity.

Additionally, we have two investments in direct ownership of commercial real estate and own these operating real estate investments through joint ventures with one or more partners. We also own four properties included in other real estate that were acquired through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and foreclosure and consolidate one property after being deemed the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity holding it. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 816.4 million or 24.0 of our assets were invested in net leased and other real estate properties and these properties were 88.1 occupied. The following table presents our net leased and other real estate investments as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased by 3.7 million to 59.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024.

 Interest expense on real estate increased by 1.2 million to 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to amortization income recorded on above-market debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 4.6 million to 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by property acquisitions during 2023 and 2024. 
 Increase of CECL reserve 
 We recorded total CECL reserves of 115.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is comprised of 87.3 million of general reserves and 28.0 million of specific reserves. The increase in our general CECL reserve was primarily driven by the macroeconomic conditions, as well as specific inputs on certain office and multifamily properties utilized in our general CECL model. The specific CECL reserves related to three senior multifamily loans and the development mezzanine loan that were all repaid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded total CECL reserves of 76.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase of specific reserves related to three office loans and the development mezzanine loan.

 Impairment of operating real estate 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment of 45.2 million on three office properties following a reduction in the current expected holding period in connection with the review and preparations of our quarterly financials. There was no impairment recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Compensation and benefits 
 Compensation and benefits decreased by 3.6 million to 26.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower stock compensation expense. 
 Operating expense 
 Operating expense decreased by 0.8 million to 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower third party costs. 
 Other income 
 Other gain, net 
 Other gain, net decreased by 0.4 million to 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to lower unrealized gains on foreign currency hedges. As of September 30, 2024, we hold no foreign currency hedges. 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures 
 We did not record equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we realized a one-time gain from our ratable share of dispute resolution proceeds of approximately 9.0 million from the senior mezzanine lender of the Development Mezzanine Loan in connection with our prior Los Angeles, California mixed-use project and retained B-participation investment. In connection with the settlement, effective January 26, 2023, we have no further interest in the loan or investment. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense decreased by 0.2 million to 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in taxable income. 
 
 Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings 
 We present Distributable Earnings, which is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure of our performance. We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and this metric is a useful indicator for investors in evaluating and comparing our operating performance to our peers and our ability to pay dividends. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. As a REIT, we are required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income and we believe that dividends are one of the principal reasons investors invest in credit or commercial mortgage REITs such as our company. Over time, Distributable Earnings has been a useful indicator of our dividends per share and we consider that measure in determining the dividend, if any, to be paid. This supplemental financial measure also helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current portfolio and operations. 
 We define Distributable Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders (or, without duplication, the owners of the common equity of our direct subsidiaries, such as our OP) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the expenses incurred in connection with our formation or other strategic transactions, (iii) the incentive fee, (iv) acquisition costs from successful acquisitions, (v) gains or losses from sales of real estate property and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, including unconsolidated joint ventures and preferred equity investments, (vi) general CECL reserves determined by probability of default/loss given default PD/LGD model, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the current quarter, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, (ix) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and (x) certain material non-cash income or expense items that in the judgment of management should not be included in Distributable Earnings. For clauses (ix) and (x), such exclusions shall only be applied after approval by a majority of our independent directors. Distributable Earnings include specific CECL reserves when realized. Loan losses are realized

Table of Contents 

 when such amounts are deemed nonrecoverable at the time the loan is repaid, or if the underlying asset is sold following foreclosure, or if we determine that it is probable that all amounts due will not be collected; realized loan losses to be included in Distributable Earnings is the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the book value of the asset. 
 Additionally, we define Adjusted Distributable Earnings as Distributable Earnings excluding (i) realized gains and losses on asset sales, (ii) fair value adjustments, which represent mark-to-market adjustments to investments in unconsolidated ventures based on an exit price, defined as the estimated price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, (iii) unrealized gains or losses, (iv) realized specific CECL reserves and (v) one-time gains or losses that in the judgement of management should not be included in Adjusted Distributable Earnings. We believe Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a useful indicator for investors to further evaluate and compare our operating performance to our peers and our ability to pay dividends, net of the impact of any gains or losses on assets sales or fair value adjustments, as described above. 
 Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings do not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings may differ from methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar non-GAAP supplemental financial measures, and accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings reported by other companies. 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders to Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings attributable to our common stockholders (dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share data) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, June 30, 2024 and 2023 and March 31, 2024 and 2023:

 Undepreciated Book Value Per Share 
 We believe that presenting undepreciated book value per share is a more useful and consistent measure of the value of our current portfolio and operations for our investors. It additionally enhances the comparability to our peers who do not hold real estate investments. Undepreciated book value per share excludes our share of accumulated depreciation and amortization on real estate investments (including related intangible assets and liabilities). It also excludes our share of the carrying value (including any related foreign currency translation) on certain net leased and other real estate office properties whose non-recourse mortgages mature within 12 months. Our ability to refinance at their maturity dates is burdened by the current interest rate environment, lenders aversion to finance or refinance office properties and/or associated improvements or paydowns potentially demanded at such properties. Loan maturity defaults can lead to foreclosures. Given this potential likelihood, we believe it is prudent to recognize impairments and exclude our share of the carrying value related to these properties.

 NOI 
 We believe NOI to be a useful measure of operating performance of our net leased and other real estate portfolios as they are more closely linked to the direct results of operations at the property level. NOI excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, which are based on different useful life estimates depending on the age of the properties, as well as adjustments for the effects of real estate impairment and gains or losses on sales of depreciated properties, which eliminate differences arising from investment and disposition decisions. Additionally, by excluding corporate level expenses or benefits such as interest expense, any gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes, which are incurred by the parent entity and are not directly linked to the operating performance of the Company s properties, NOI provides a measure of operating performance independent of the Company s capital structure and indebtedness. However, the exclusion of these items as well as others, such as capital expenditures and leasing costs, which are necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company s properties, and transaction costs and administrative costs, may limit the usefulness of NOI. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness. 
 NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating NOI involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other companies, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with other companies. 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of net income (loss) on our net leased and other real estate portfolios attributable to our common stockholders to NOI attributable to our common stockholders (dollars in thousands) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, June 30, 2024 and 2023 and March 31, 2024 and 2023:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our material cash commitments include commitments to repay borrowings, finance our assets and operations, meet future funding obligations, make distributions to our stockholders and fund other general business needs. We use significant cash to make investments, meet commitments to existing investments, repay the principal of and interest on our borrowings and pay other financing costs, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities and cash generated from asset sales and investment maturities. However, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our Investment Company Act exclusion, we may use several sources to finance our business, including bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), Master Repurchase Facilities and securitizations, as described below. In addition to our current sources of liquidity, there may be opportunities from time to time to access liquidity through public offerings of debt and equity securities. We have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our material cash commitments for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
 Financing Strategy 
 We have a multi-pronged financing strategy that includes an up to 165.0 million secured revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024, up to approximately 2.0 billion in secured revolving repurchase facilities, 1.1 billion in non-recourse securitization financing, 602.2 million in commercial mortgages and 34.5 million in other asset-level financing structures. 
 In addition, we may use other forms of financing, including additional warehouse facilities, public and private secured and unsecured debt issuances and equity or equity-related securities issuances by us or our subsidiaries. We may also finance a portion of our investments through the syndication of one or more interests in a whole loan. We will seek to match the nature and duration of the financing with the underlying asset s cash flow, including using hedges, as appropriate. 
 Debt-to-Equity Ratio

 Potential Sources of Liquidity 
 As discussed in greater detail above under Trends Affecting our Business, and Factors Impacting Our Operating Results overall market uncertainty coupled with rising inflation and interest rates have tempered the loan financing markets recently. A rising interest rate environment will result in increased interest expense on our variable rate debt that is not hedged and may result in disruptions to our borrowers and tenants ability to finance their activities, which would similarly adversely impact their ability to make their monthly mortgage payments and meet their loan obligations. Additionally, due to the current market conditions, warehouse lenders may take a more conservative stance by increasing funding costs, which may lead to margin calls. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include borrowings available under our credit facilities, Master Repurchase Facilities and monthly mortgage payments from our borrowers. 
 Bank Credit Facilities 
 We use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our business. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. 
 On January 28, 2022, the OP (together with certain subsidiaries of the OP from time to time party thereto as borrowers, collectively, the Borrowers entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), and the several lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders ), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to provide a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 165.0 million, of which up to 25.0 million is available as letters of credit. Loans under the Credit Agreement may be advanced in U.S. dollars and certain foreign currencies, including euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs. The Credit Agreement amended and restated the OP s prior 300.0 million revolving credit facility that would have matured on February 1, 2022. 
 The Credit Agreement also includes an option for the Borrowers to increase the maximum available principal amount of up to 300.0 million, subject to one or more new or existing Lenders agreeing to provide such additional loan commitments and satisfaction of other customary conditions. 
 Advances under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the applicable Borrower s election, either (x) an adjusted SOFR rate plus a margin of 2.25 , or (y) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the Wall Street Journal s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 and (iii) the adjusted SOFR rate plus 1.00 , plus a margin of 1.25 . An unused commitment fee at a rate of 0.25 or 0.35 , per annum, depending on the amount of facility utilization, applies to un-utilized borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. Amounts owed under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the case of borrowings with respect to which a SOFR rate election is in effect. 
 The maximum amount available for borrowing at any time under the Credit Agreement is limited to a borrowing base valuation of certain investment assets, with the valuation of such investment assets generally determined according to a percentage of adjusted net book value. As of the date hereof, the borrowing base valuation is sufficient to permit borrowings of up to the entire 165.0 million. If any borrowing is outstanding for more than 180 days after its initial draw, the borrowing base valuation will be reduced by 50 until all outstanding borrowings are repaid in full. The ability to borrow new amounts under the Credit Agreement terminates on January 31, 2026, at which time the OP may, at its election and by written notice to the Administrative Agent, extend the termination date for two additional terms of six months each, subject to the terms and conditions in the Credit Agreement, resulting in a latest termination date of January 31, 2027. 
 The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed pursuant to a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement by substantially all material wholly owned subsidiaries of the OP (the Guarantors in favor of the Administrative Agent (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a pledge of substantially all equity interests owned by the Borrowers and the Guarantors, as well as by a security interest in deposit accounts of the Borrowers and the Guarantors in which the proceeds of investment asset distributions are maintained. 
 The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, the obligation of the Company to maintain REIT status and be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and limitations on debt, liens and restricted payments. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants applicable to the OP and its consolidated subsidiaries: (a) minimum consolidated tangible net worth of the OP to be greater than or equal to the sum of (i) 1,112,000,000 and (ii) 70 of the net cash proceeds received by the OP from any offering of its common equity after September 30, 2021 and of the net cash proceeds from any offering by the Company of its common equity to the extent such proceeds are contributed to the OP, excluding any such proceeds that are contributed to the OP within ninety (90) days of

 receipt and applied to acquire capital stock of the OP; (b) the OP s ratio of EBITDA plus lease expenses to fixed charges for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be not less than 1.50 to 1.00; (c) the OP s minimum interest coverage ratio to be not less than 3.00 to 1.00; and (d) the OP s ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total assets to be not more than 0.80 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants or representations, cross default to material indebtedness, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy matters involving any Borrower or any Guarantor and certain change of control events. The occurrence of an event of default will limit the ability of the OP and its subsidiaries to make distributions and may result in the termination of the credit facility, acceleration of repayment obligations and the exercise of remedies by the Lenders with respect to the collateral. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 Master Repurchase Facilities 
 Currently, our primary sources of financing the origination of first mortgage loans and senior loan participations secured by senior loan investments are our repurchase agreements with multiple global financial institutions (each, a Master Repurchase Facility and collectively, the Master Repurchase Facilities ). The Master Repurchase Facilities, effectively allow us to borrow against loans that we own in an amount generally equal to (i) the market value of such loans multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we sell our loans to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and pay interest to the lender under the master repurchase agreement. We intend to maintain formal relationships with multiple counterparties to obtain master repurchase financing. 
 The following table presents a summary of our Master Repurchase Facilities and Bank Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Maximum Facility Size Current Borrowings Weighted Average Final Maturity (Years) Weighted Average Interest Rate (1)

 The decrease in our end of period UPB from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024 was driven by financing paydowns during the period. 
 Securitizations 
 We may seek to utilize non-recourse long-term securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans, especially loan originations, to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our REIT qualification and exclusion from the Investment

 Company Act in order to generate cash for funding new investments. This would involve conveying a pool of assets to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which would issue one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes would be secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we would receive the cash proceeds on the sale of non-recourse notes and a 100 interest in the equity of the issuing entity. The securitization of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because any equity interest we retain in the issuing entity would be subordinate to the notes issued to investors and we would, therefore, absorb all of the losses sustained with respect to a securitized pool of assets before the owners of the notes experience any losses. 
 CLNC 2019-FL1 
 In October 2019, we executed a securitization transaction, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, CLNC 2019-FL1, Ltd. and CLNC 2019-FL1, LLC (collectively, CLNC 2019-FL1 ), which resulted in the sale of 840.4 million of the 2019-FL1 Notes. 
 On August 19, 2024, we redeemed the outstanding securities under CLNC 2019-FL1, including the 2019-FL1 Notes, at a redemption price of 311.6 million. The 14 senior loan investments, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of 477.7 million, held by CLNC 2019-FL1 were refinanced by the proceeds from the issuance of the securities under BRSP 2024-FL2 (as defined below), including the 2024-FL2 Notes (as defined below), and an existing Master Repurchase Facility. 
 BRSP 2021-FL1 
 In July 2021, we executed a securitization transaction through our subsidiaries, BRSP 2021-FL1, Ltd. and BRSP 2021-FL1, LLC, which resulted in the sale of 670.0 million of investment grade notes. 
 As of May 26, 2023, the benchmark index interest rate was converted from LIBOR to Term SOFR, plus a benchmark adjustment of 11.448 basis points, pursuant to the indenture agreement. Term SOFR for any interest accrual period shall be the one-month CME Term SOFR reference rate as published by the CME Group Benchmark Administration on each benchmark determination date. 
 BRSP 2021-FL1 included a two-year reinvestment feature that allowed us to contribute existing or newly originated loan investments in exchange for proceeds from repayments or repurchases of loans held in BRSP 2021-FL1, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture. The reinvestment period for BRSP 2021-FL1 expired on July 20, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, two loans held in BRSP 2021-F1 were fully repaid, totaling 79.7 million, and four loans were partially repaid totaling 11.4 million. The proceeds from the repayments were used to amortize the securitization bonds in accordance with the securitization priority of repayments. At September 30, 2024, we had 640.5 million of unpaid principal balance of CRE debt investments financed with BRSP 2021-FL1. As of September 30, 2024, the securitization reflects an advance rate of 79.7 at a weighted average cost of funds of Term SOFR plus 1.59 (before transaction costs), and is collateralized by a pool of 24 senior loan investments. 
 Additionally, BRSP 2021-FL1 contains note protection tests that can be triggered as a result of contributed loan defaults, losses, and certain other events outlined in the indenture, beyond established thresholds. A note protection test failure that is not remedied can result in the redirection of interest proceeds from the below investment grade tranches to amortize the most senior outstanding tranche. We did not fail any note protection tests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. While we continue to closely monitor all loan investments contributed to BRSP 2021-FL1, a deterioration in the performance of an underlying loan could negatively impact our liquidity position. 
 BRSP 2024-FL2 
 In August 2024, we executed a 675.0 million securitization transaction through wholly-owned subsidiaries, BRSP 2024-FL2, Ltd. and BRSP 2024-FL2, LLC (collectively, BRSP 2024-FL2 ), which resulted in the sale of 583.9 million of the 2024-FL2 Notes. 
 BRSP 2024-FL2 includes a six-month ramp-up acquisition period that allows us to contribute existing or newly originated loan investments in exchange for 84.8 million in unused proceeds held in BRSP 2024-FL2, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture. BRSP 2024-FL2 also includes a two-year reinvestment feature that allows us to contribute existing or newly originated loan investments in exchange for proceeds from repayments of loans held in BRSP 2024-FL2, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture. As of September 30, 2024, the securitization reflects an advance rate of 86.5 at a weighted average cost of funds of Term SOFR plus 2.47 (before transaction costs), and is collateralized by a pool of 21 senior loan investments and cash. 
 Additionally, BRSP 2024-FL2 contains note protection tests that can be triggered as a result of contributed loan defaults, losses, and certain other events outlined in the indenture, beyond established thresholds. A note protection test failure that is not remedied can result in the redirection of interest proceeds from the below investment grade tranches to amortize the most senior

 outstanding tranche. While we continue to closely monitor all loan investments contributed to BRSP 2024-FL2, a deterioration in the performance of an underlying loan could negatively impact our liquidity position. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, one loan held in BRSP 2024-FL2 was fully repaid, totaling 19.8 million. We will replace repaid loans by contributing existing loan investments of equal value. At September 30, 2024, we had 570.4 million of unpaid principal balance of senior loan investments financed with BRSP 2024-FL2. 
 Other potential sources of financing 
 In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including secured and unsecured forms of borrowing and selective wind-down and dispositions of assets. We may also seek to raise equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments. 
 Liquidity Needs 
 In addition to our loan origination activity and general operating expenses, our primary liquidity needs include interest and principal payments under our Bank Credit Facility, securitization bonds, and secured debt. Information concerning our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments, including our commitments to repay borrowings, is included in the following table as of September 30, 2024. This table excludes our obligations that are not fixed and determinable (dollars in thousands): 
 Payments Due by Period Total Less than a Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Bank credit facility (1) 
 1,238 413 825 Secured debt (2)

 108,137 Total 2,878,073 
 _________________________________________ 
 (1) Future interest payments were estimated based on the applicable index at September 30, 2024 and unused commitment fee of 0.25 per annum, assuming principal is repaid on the current maturity date of January 2027. 
 (2) Amounts include minimum principal and interest obligations through the initial maturity date of the collateral assets. Interest on floating rate debt was determined based on Term SOFR at September 30, 2024. 
 (3) The timing of future principal payments was estimated based on expected future cash flows of underlying collateral loans. Repayments are estimated to be earlier than contractual maturity only if proceeds from underlying loans are repaid by the borrowers. 
 (4) The amounts represent minimum future base rent commitments through initial expiration dates of the respective noncancellable operating ground leases, excluding any contingent rent payments. Rents paid under ground leases are recoverable from tenants. 
 (5) Future lending commitments may be subject to certain conditions that borrowers must meet to qualify for such fundings. Commitment amount assumes future fundings meet the terms to qualify for such fundings. 
 Share Repurchases 
 In April 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program Stock Repurchase Program under which we may repurchase up to 50.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock until April 30, 2025. The Stock Repurchase Program replaces the prior stock repurchase program authorization which expired on April 30, 2024. Under the Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We have a written trading plan as part of the Share Repurchase Program that provides for share repurchases in open market transactions that is intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The Stock Repurchase Program will be utilized at our discretion and in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate requirements and other conditions. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of 5.52 per share for an aggregate cost of 6.6 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 43.4 million remaining available to make repurchases under the Stock Repurchase Plan. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): 

77 

Table of Contents 

 Nine Months Ended September 30, Cash flow provided by (used in): 2024 2023 Change Operating activities 78,701 101,217 (22,516) Investing activities 235,662 228,909 6,753 Financing activities (237,540) (395,194) 157,654 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash inflows from operating activities are generated primarily through interest received from loans and preferred equity held for investment, and property operating income from our real estate portfolio. This is partially offset by payment of interest expenses for credit facilities and mortgages payable, and operating expenses supporting our various lines of business, including property management and operations, loan servicing and workout of loans in default, investment transaction costs, as well as general administrative costs. 
 Our operating activities provided net cash inflows of 78.7 million and 101.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower net interest income recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We believe cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities include cash outlays for disbursements on new and/or existing loans, which are partially offset by repayments of loans held for investment. 
 Investing activities generated net cash inflows of 235.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2024 resulted primarily from repayments on loans held for investment, net of 282.9 million partially offset by the origination and fundings on our loans held for investment, net of 47.2 million. 
 Investing activities generated net cash inflows of 228.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2023 resulted primarily from repayments on loans held for investment, net of 288.7 million partially offset by future advances on our loans held for investment, net of 57.5 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 We finance our investing activities largely through borrowings secured by our investments along with capital from third party investors. We also have the ability to raise capital in the public markets through issuances of common stock, as well as draw upon our corporate credit facility, to finance our investing and operating activities. Accordingly, we incur cash outlays for payments on third party debt and dividends to our common stockholders. 
 Financing activities used net cash of 237.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted primarily from repayment of credit facilities of 602.0 million, repayment of securitization bonds of 403.4 million and distributions paid on common stock of 78.3 million partially offset by borrowings from securitization bonds of 582.5 million and borrowings from credit facilities 297.6 million. 
 Financing activities used net cash of 395.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted primarily from repayment of credit facilities of 243.7 million, repayment of securitization bonds of 177.7 million and distributions paid on common stock of 78.0 million partially offset by borrowings from credit facilities of 110.8 million. 
 
 Our Investment Strategy 
 Our objective is to generate consistent and attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. We seek to achieve this objective primarily through cash distributions and the preservation of invested capital. We believe our investment strategy provides flexibility through economic cycles to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. This approach is driven by a disciplined investment strategy, focused on: 
 leveraging long standing relationships, our organization structure and the experience of the team; 
 the underlying real estate and market dynamics to identify investments with attractive risk-return profiles; 
 primarily originating and structuring CRE senior loans and selective investments in mezzanine loans and preferred equity with attractive return profiles relative to the underlying value and financial operating performance of the real estate collateral, given the strength and quality of the sponsorship; 

78 

Table of Contents 

 structuring transactions with a prudent amount of leverage, if any, given the risk of the underlying asset s cash flows, attempting to match the structure and duration of the financing with the underlying asset s cash flows, including through the use of hedges, as appropriate; and 
 operating our net leased real estate investments and selectively pursuing new investments based on property location and purpose, tenant credit quality, market lease rates and potential appreciation of, and alternative uses for, the real estate. 
 The period for which we intend to hold our investments will vary depending on the type of asset, interest rates, investment performance, micro and macro real estate environment, capital markets and credit availability, among other factors. We generally expect to hold debt investments until the stated maturity and equity investments in accordance with each investment s proposed business plan. We may sell all or a partial ownership interest in an investment before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions have maximized its value to us, or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 Our investment strategy is flexible, enabling us to adapt to shifts in economic, real estate and capital market conditions and to exploit market inefficiencies. We may expand or change our investment strategy or target assets over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market conditions. This flexibility in our investment strategy allows us to employ a customized, solutions-oriented approach, which we believe is attractive to borrowers and tenants. We believe that our diverse portfolio, our ability to originate, acquire and manage our target assets and the flexibility of our investment strategy positions us to capitalize on market inefficiencies and generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. 
 
 Underwriting, Asset and Risk Management 
 We closely monitor our portfolio and actively manage risks associated with, among other things, our assets and interest rates. Prior to investing in any particular asset, the underwriting team, in conjunction with third party providers, undertakes a rigorous asset-level due diligence process, involving intensive data collection and analysis, to ensure that we understand fully the state of the market and the risk-reward profile of the asset. Beginning in 2021, our investment and portfolio management and risk assessment practices diligence the environmental, social and governance ESG standards of our business counterparties, including borrowers, sponsors and that of our investment assets and underlying collateral, which may include sustainability initiatives, recycling, energy efficiency and water management, volunteer and charitable efforts, anti-money laundering and know-your-client policies, and diversity, equity and inclusion practices in workforce leadership, composition and hiring practices. Prior to making a final investment decision, we focus on portfolio diversification to determine whether a target asset will cause our portfolio to be too heavily concentrated with, or cause too much risk exposure to, any one borrower, real estate sector, geographic region, source of cash flow for payment or other geopolitical issues. If we determine that a proposed acquisition presents excessive concentration risk, we may determine not to acquire an otherwise attractive asset. 
 For each asset that we acquire, our asset management team engages in active management of the asset, the intensity of which depends on the attendant risks. The asset manager works collaboratively with the underwriting team to formulate a strategic plan for the particular asset, which includes evaluating the underlying collateral and updating valuation assumptions to reflect changes in the real estate market and the general economy. This plan also generally outlines several strategies for the asset to extract the maximum amount of value from each asset under a variety of market conditions. Such strategies may vary depending on the type of asset, the availability of refinancing options, recourse and maturity, but may include, among others, the restructuring of non-performing or sub-performing loans, the negotiation of discounted pay-offs or other modification of the terms governing a loan, and the foreclosure and management of assets underlying non-performing loans in order to reposition them for profitable disposition. We continuously track the progress of an asset against the original business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to own the asset do not outweigh the associated rewards. Under these circumstances, certain assets will require intensified asset management in order to achieve optimal value realization. 
 Our asset management team engages in a proactive and comprehensive on-going review of the credit quality of each asset it manages. In particular, for debt investments on at least an annual basis, the asset management team will evaluate the financial wherewithal of individual borrowers to meet contractual obligations as well as review the financial stability of the assets securing such debt investments. Further, there is ongoing review of borrower covenant compliance including the ability of borrowers to meet certain negotiated debt service coverage ratios and debt yield tests. For equity investments, the asset management team, with the assistance of third-party property managers, monitors and reviews key metrics such as occupancy, same store sales, tenant payment rates, property budgets and capital expenditures. If through this analysis of credit quality, the asset management team encounters declines in credit quality not in accordance with the original business plan, the team evaluates the risks and determines what changes, if any, are required to the business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to hold the investment do not outweigh the associated rewards.

 In addition, the audit committee of our Board of Directors, in consultation with management, periodically reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including key risks to which we are subject, including credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such risks. 
 
 Inflation 
 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate. Substantially all of the leases at our multifamily properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our multifamily properties. 
 Refer to Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional details. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Updates 
 For recent accounting updates, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our primary market risks are interest rate risk, prepayment risk, extension risk, credit risk, real estate market risk, capital market risk and foreign currency risk, either directly through the assets held or indirectly through investments in unconsolidated ventures. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk relates to the risk that the future cash flow of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, international conflicts, inflation and other factors beyond our control. Credit curve spread risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for loans and securities we hold. Excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield. This demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the U.S. Treasury securities yield curve, or other benchmark interest rates, to value these assets. 
 As U.S. Treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and/or the spread to U.S. Treasuries used to price the assets increases, the price at which we could sell some of our fixed rate financial assets may decline. Conversely, as U.S. Treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and/or the spread to U.S. Treasuries used to price the assets decreases, the value of our fixed rate financial assets may increase. Fluctuations in SOFR may affect the amount of interest income we earn on our floating rate borrowings and interest expense we incur on borrowings indexed to SOFR, including under credit facilities and investment-level financing. 
 We utilize a variety of financial instruments on some of our investments, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange contracts, in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our operations. The use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest-earning assets and/or interest-bearing liabilities carries certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for distribution and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. A hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses of rising interest rates. Moreover, with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges, there is exposure to the risk that the counterparties may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments, which may inhibit the ability to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates. At September 30, 2024, we held no derivative instruments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate benchmark on our loan portfolio would increase or decrease interest income by 6.3 million annually, net of interest expense.

 See the Factors Impacting Our Operating Results section in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on interest rates. 
 Prepayment risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, resulting in a less than expected return on an investment. As prepayments of principal are received, any premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income, while any discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income. Therefore, an increase in prepayment rates has the following impact: (i) accelerates amortization of purchase premiums, which reduces interest income earned on the assets; and conversely, (ii) accelerates accretion of purchase discounts, which increases interest income earned on the assets. 
 Extension risk 
 The weighted average life of assets is projected based on assumptions regarding the rate at which borrowers will prepay or extend their mortgages. If prepayment rates decrease or extension options are exercised by borrowers at a rate that deviates significantly from projections, the life of fixed rate assets could extend beyond the term of the secured debt agreements. This in turn could negatively impact liquidity to the extent that assets may have to be sold and losses may be incurred as a result. 
 Credit risk 
 Investment in loans held for investment is subject to a high degree of credit risk through exposure to loss from loan defaults. Default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, borrower financial condition, property performance, property management, supply/demand factors, construction trends, consumer behavior, regional economics, interest rates, the strength of the U.S. economy and other factors beyond our control. All loans are subject to a certain probability of default. We manage credit risk through the underwriting process, acquiring investments at the appropriate discount to face value, if any, and establishing loss assumptions. We carefully monitor performance of all loans, including those held through joint venture investments, as well as the external factors that may affect their value. 
 We are also subject to the credit risk of the tenants in our properties, including business closures, occupancy levels, meeting rent or other expense obligations, lease concessions, and ESG standards and practices among other factors. We seek to undertake a rigorous credit evaluation of the tenants prior to acquiring properties. This analysis includes an extensive due diligence investigation of the tenants businesses, as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the underlying real estate to the respective tenants core business operations. Where appropriate, we may seek to augment the tenants commitment to the properties by structuring various credit enhancement mechanisms into the underlying leases. These mechanisms could include security deposit requirements or guarantees from entities that are deemed credit worthy. 
 We continue to work closely with our borrowers and tenants to address any lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses. 
 Our in-depth understanding of CRE and real estate-related investments, and in-house underwriting, asset management and resolution capabilities, provides us and management with a sophisticated full-service platform to regularly evaluate our investments and determine primary, secondary or alternative strategies to manage the credit risks described above. This includes intermediate servicing and complex and creative negotiating, restructuring of non-performing investments, foreclosure considerations, intense management or development of owned real estate, in each case to manage the risks faced to achieve value realization events in our interests and our stockholders. Solutions considered may include defensive loan or lease modifications, temporary interest or rent deferrals or forbearances, converting current interest payment obligations to payment-in-kind, repurposing reserves and/or covenant waivers. Depending on the nature of the underlying investment and credit risk, we may pursue repositioning strategies through judicious capital investment in order to extract value from the investment or limit losses. 
 There can be no assurance that the measures we take will be sufficient to address or mitigate the impact of credit risk on our future operating results, liquidity and financial condition. 
 Real estate market risk 
 We are exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate market. The market values of commercial real estate are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional, and local economic conditions, as well as changes or weakness in specific industry segments, and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which have and may continue to affect occupancy rates, capitalization rates and absorption rates. This in turn could impact the performance of tenants and borrowers. We seek to manage these risks through our underwriting due diligence and asset management processes and the solutions-oriented process described above. 

81 

Table of Contents 

 Capital markets risk 
 We are exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, specifically the ability to finance our business through borrowings under secured revolving repurchase facilities, secured and unsecured warehouse facilities or other debt instruments. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of our borrowings. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a direct and volatile impact on the global markets, including the commercial real estate equity and debt capital markets. The continued disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a negative impact on asset valuations and significant constraints on liquidity in the capital markets, which have led to restrictions on lending activity, downward pressure on covenant compliance and requirements to post margin or repayments under master repurchase financing arrangements. Our Master Repurchase Facilities are partial recourse, and margin call provisions do not permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets events; rather they are limited to collateral-specific credit marks generally determined on a commercially reasonable basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and through October 29, 2024, we have not received any margin calls under our Master Repurchase Facilities. 
 We have amended our Bank Credit Facility and Master Repurchase Facilities to adjust certain covenants (such as the tangible net worth covenant), reduce advance rates on certain financed assets, obtain margin call holidays and permitted modification flexibilities, in an effort to mitigate the risk of future compliance issues, including margin calls, under our financing arrangements. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We have foreign currency rate exposures related to our foreign currency-denominated investments held by our foreign subsidiaries. Changes in foreign currency rates can adversely affect the fair values and earning of our non-U.S. holdings. We generally mitigate this foreign currency risk by utilizing currency instruments to hedge our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries. The type of hedging instruments that we employed on our foreign subsidiary investments were put options. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately NOK 240.5 million or a total of 22.9 million, in net investments in our European subsidiaries. A 1.0 change in the foreign currency rate would result in a 0.2 million increase or decrease in translation gain or loss included in other comprehensive income in connection with our European subsidiary. 
 We had no foreign exchange contracts in place at September 30, 2024. Our previous foreign exchange contracts, including notional amount and key terms, is included in Note 13, Derivatives, to Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements. The maturity dates of these instruments approximated the projected dates of related cash flows for specific investments. Termination or maturity of currency hedging instruments may have resulted in an obligation for payment to or from the counterparty to the hedging agreement. We were exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties for these contracts. To manage this risk, we selected major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties and performed a quarterly review of the financial health and stability of our trading counterparties. No counterparty defaulted on its obligations when we held foreign exchange contracts. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
