 billion of assets under management and a track record of investing in the middle market. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, credit and net lease investment strategies. The Investment Adviser manages the Company's day-to-day operations and provides it with investment advisory and management services. The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to the Company's. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the "Administrator ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct the Company's day-to-day operations. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 
 The Company conducted a private offering (the "Private Offering") of its common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). At the closing of any Private Offering, each investor will make a capital commitment (each, a "Capital Commitment") to purchase common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with the Company (each, a "Subscription Agreement"). Each investor will be required to make capital contributions to purchase the Company's common stock each time a drawdown notice is issued based on such investor's Capital Commitment. The Company commenced its loan origination and investment activities on the date it issued shares to persons not affiliated with the Investment Adviser, which occurred on February 18, 2020 (the "Initial Closing Date"). The Company may conduct subsequent closings at times during its investment period (the "Investment Period"), which commenced on the Initial Closing Date and initially continued until September 30, 2023, subject to automatic extensions thereafter, each for an additional period, unless the holders of a majority of the Company's outstanding common stock elect to forego any such extension upon not less than prior written notice. Effective September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Investment Period was automatically extended for an additional period to September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2025, respectively. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements entered into with each investor, the Company shall commence the wind up of operations following the expiration of the Investment Period, subject to additional extensions, each for an additional period, upon approval of the holders of a majority of the Company's then outstanding common stock. 
 On December 9, 2020, the Company established NMF SLF I SPV, L.L.C. ("SLF I SPV") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, whose assets are used to secure SLF I SPV's credit facility. On October 6, 2022, the Company established NMF SLF I Opportunistic SPV, L.L.C. ("SLF I Opportunistic SPV") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no assets held by SLF I Opportunistic SPV. 
 The Company is focused on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. upper middle market companies backed by top private equity sponsors. The Company s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of senior secured loans and select junior capital positions, to growing businesses in defensive industries that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company s differentiated investment approach leverages the deep sector knowledge and operating resources of New Mountain Capital. 
 
 The Company primarily invests in senior secured debt of U.S. sponsor-backed, middle market companies. The Company defines middle market companies as those businesses with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") between and . The Company focuses on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams. 
 
 Senior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. The Company invests a significant portion of its portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-

 or more of the Company's outstanding shares, and (ii) the Company's shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, an unaffiliated third-party ("Sub-Administrator") has been engaged to independently value the Company's investments, in consultation with the Investment Adviser. The Company's quarterly valuation procedures, which are the procedures that will be followed by such Sub-Administrator, are set forth in more detail below: 
 (1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. 
 (2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. 
 a. Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and, if so, the quote is used. If the Sub-Administrator is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 or if the spread between the bid and ask for a quote is greater than , the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; and 
 ii. Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated by the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals at the Investment Adviser. The personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. For assets where a supporting analysis is prepared, the Sub-Administrator will document the selection and appropriateness of the indices selected for yield comparison and a conclusion documenting how the yield comparison analysis supports the proposed mark. The quarterly portfolio company monitoring reports which detail the qualitative and quantitative performance of the portfolio company will also be included. If the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals at the Investment Adviser, is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). 
 (3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: 
 a. Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring; and 
 b. Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with the Company's senior management. 
 For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of a commitment not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded. 
 The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company's investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material. 
 In the event Benefit Plan Investors do not hold or more of the Company's outstanding shares, or the Company's shares are listed on a national securities exchange, then (i) personnel of the Investment Adviser will undertake the roles to be performed by the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, as described above and (ii) if an investment falls into category (3) above for four consecutive quarters and the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by the Board.

 Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible. 
 Non-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate collectability. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments were on non-accrual status. 
 Fee income: Fee income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, upfront fees and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after the trade date. Fee income may also include fees from bridge loans. The Company may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received by the Company for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment, and are non-refundable. Income received in exchange for the provision of services such as recurring administration services are also recognized as fee income in the period in which it was earned.

 For a discussion of the Company's unfunded commitments, see Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies. 
 Investment Risk Factors First and second lien debt that the Company invests in is almost entirely rated below investment grade or may be unrated. Debt investments rated below investment grade are often referred to as "leveraged loans", "high yield" or "junk" debt investments, and may be considered "high risk" compared to debt investments that are rated investment grade. These debt investments are considered speculative because of the credit risk of the issuers. Such issuers are considered more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal, and such risk of default could reduce the net asset value and income distributions of the Company. In addition, some of the Company's debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which could result in a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. First and second lien debt may also lose significant market value before a default occurs. Furthermore, an active trading market may not exist for these securities. This illiquidity may make it more difficult to value the investments. 
 The Company may directly invest in the equity of private companies or, in some cases, equity investments could be made in connection with a debt investment. Equity investments may or may not fluctuate in value, resulting in recognized realized gains or losses upon disposition.

Transfers into Level III occur as quotations obtained through pricing services are deemed not representative of fair value as of the balance sheet date, and such assets are internally valued. As quotations obtained through pricing services are substantiated through additional market sources, investments are transferred out of Level III. In addition, transfers out of Level III and transfers into Level III occur based on the increase or decrease in the availability of certain observable inputs. Investments will be transferred into Level III from Level II and out of Level III into Level II at fair value as of the beginning of the period in which the reclassification occurred.

 Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, during the Investment Period, the base management fee is calculated at an annual blended rate with respect to the Company's Assets Invested (defined below) at the end of each quarterly period by reference to (i) in the case of Assets Invested equal to or less than , and (ii) in the case of Assets Invested of greater than , subject, in each case, to the adjustments in the manner set forth in the Investment Management Agreement, as amended. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the management fee shall be calculated at the blended rate until such time that the Company has billion of Assets Invested (as modified by the Second A R Investment Management Agreement). Upon such time, the management fee shall be calculated at the Blended Rate, as defined in the Second A R Investment Management Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, based on the greater of the actual Assets Invested as of the end of any quarter and target Assets Invested for the quarter. The Second A R Investment Management Agreement modified the definition of "Assets Invested" to mean that as of the end of each quarterly period, the sum of the Company's (i) drawn capital commitments, (ii) the aggregate dollar amount of distributions declared to stockholders from net investment income as of the latest declaration date of any such distribution, less any amounts of such distribution received in cash by stockholders, and (iii) outstanding principal on borrowings. 
 During the Investment Period, the management fee payable each quarter shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of the quarterly fee percentage multiplied by the Company's cumulative realized losses since inception (calculated net of any subsequently reversed realized losses) (the "Cumulative Losses") on the Company s portfolio of investments (collectively, the "Withheld Amounts"). Any portion of such Withheld Amounts that is attributable to a subsequently reversed realized loss shall be payable to the Investment Adviser in the quarter in which such reversal occurs. In addition, upon expiration of the Investment Period, the Investment Adviser shall be entitled to an amount equal to the portion of such Withheld Amounts that would have been payable if Cumulative Losses had been calculated net of cumulative realized capital gains on the applicable portfolios of investments. 
 The Company has entered into an administration agreement ("Administration Agreement") with the Administrator under which the Administrator provides administrative services. The Administration Agreement was most recently re-approved by the Board on January 30, 2024 for a period of months commencing on March 1, 2024. The Administrator maintains, or oversees the maintenance of, the Company's consolidated financial records, prepares reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), generally monitors the payment of the Company's expenses and oversees the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of NMF SLF I, Inc. 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of NMF SLF I, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company"), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of the Company, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 6, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation formed on January 23, 2019. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").

 We conducted a private offering (the "Private Offering") of our common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. At the closing of any Private Offering, each investor in the Private Offering will make a capital commitment (each, a "Capital Commitment") to purchase common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us (each, a "Subscription Agreement"). We commenced our loan origination and investment activities on the date we issued shares to persons not affiliated with the Investment Adviser (the "Initial Closing Date"), which occurred on February 18, 2020. We may conduct subsequent closings at times during our investment period (the "Investment Period"), which commenced on the Initial Closing Date and initially continued until September 30, 2023, subject to automatic extensions thereafter, each for an additional one year period, unless the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock elect to forego any such extension upon not less than ninety days prior written notice. Effective September 30, 2023 and September 30 2024, the Investment Period was automatically extended for an additional one year period to September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2025, respectively. Each investor will be required to make capital contributions to purchase our common stock each time a drawdown notice is issued based on such investor's Capital Commitment. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement entered into with each investor, we shall commence the wind up of operations two years following the expiration of the Investment Period, subject to additional extensions, each for an additional one year period, upon approval of the holders of a majority of our then outstanding common stock. 
 On December 9, 2020, we established NMF SLF I SPV, L.L.C. ("SLF I SPV") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary whose assets are used to secure SLF I SPV's credit facility. On December 23, 2020, SLF I SPV entered into a Loan and Security Agreement among SLF I SPV as the borrower, the Investment Adviser as collateral manager, us as equity holder and seller,Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as the administrative agent and the collateral custodian, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto (as amended, from time to time, the "Loan and Security Agreement"), which is structured as a secured revolving credit facility (the "Wells Credit Facility"). On October 6, 2022, we established NMF SLF I Opportunistic SPV, L.L.C. ("SLF I Opportunistic SPV"), as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no assets held by SLF I Opportunistic SPV. 
 We primarily invest in senior secured debt of U.S. sponsor-backed, middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those businesses with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") between 10.0 million and 200.0 million. We focus on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams. 
 Senior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. We invest a significant portion of its portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt. Certain unitranche loan investments may include last-out positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our top five industry concentrations were software, business services, healthcare, financial services and consumer services. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net assets were approximately 975.7 million and our portfolio had a fair value of approximately 1,479.0 million in 128 portfolio companies. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 On November 1, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Loan and Security Agreement (the Fourth Amendment by and among the Investment Advisor, as collateral manager, SLF I SPV, as borrower, us, as equityholder and seller, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent and the collateral custodian, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto. The Fourth Amendment amended the Wells Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the Facility Maturity Date (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) from December 2028 to November 2029, (ii) increase the maximum facility amount from 600,000 to 700,000, and (iii) modify the applicable spread used to determine the per annum interest rate payable under the Wells Credit Facility from 2.40 to 2.05 .

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting estimates. 
 Basis of Accounting 
 We consolidate our wholly-owned direct subsidiaries SLF I SPV and SLF I Opportunistic SPV. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies ("ASC 946").

 Valuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments 
 At all times, consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, which impacts our net asset value. 
 We value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors (the "Board") is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Because (i) "benefit plan investors", as defined in Section 3(42) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and any regulations promulgated thereunder ("Benefit Plan Investors"), hold 25 or more of our outstanding shares, and (ii) our shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, an unaffiliated third-party (the "Sub-Administrator") has been engaged to independently value our investments, in consultation with the Investment Adviser. Our quarterly valuation procedures, which are the procedures that will be followed by such Sub-Administrator, are set forth in more detail below: 
 (1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. 
 (2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. 
 a. Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and, if so, the quote is used. If the Sub-Administrator is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and 
 b. For investments other than bonds, the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following procedures: 
 i. Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. If an IHS Markit Ltd. quote differs from the Refinitiv (formerly known as Thomson Reuters) quote by +/- 5 or if the spread between the bid and ask for a quote is greater than 10 , the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; 
 ii. Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated by the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals at the Investment Adviser. The personnel of the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. For assets where a supporting analysis is prepared, the Sub-Administrator will document the selection and appropriateness of the indices selected for yield comparison and a conclusion documenting how the yield comparison analysis supports the proposed mark. The quarterly portfolio company monitoring reports which detail the qualitative and quantitative performance of the portfolio company will also be included. If the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals at the Investment Adviser, is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). 
 (3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: 
 a. Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the Sub-Administrator, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring; and 
 b. Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management.

 For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of a commitment not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded. 
 The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material. 
 In the event Benefit Plan Investors do not hold 25 or more of our outstanding shares, or our shares are listed on a national securities exchange, then (i) personnel of the Investment Adviser will undertake the roles to be performed by the personnel of the Sub-Administrator, as described above and (ii) if an investment falls into category (3) above for four consecutive quarters and the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our Board. 
 GAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows: 
 Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. 
 Level II Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following: 
 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently); 
 Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and 
 Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 Level III Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. 
 The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs. 
 The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Value in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024.

 We generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there is little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered: 
 Company Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and EBITDA growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original investment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation. 
 For debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value. After enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment. 
 Market Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing EBITDA or revenue multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, and relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA or revenue multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month ("LTM") EBITDA or revenue or projected EBITDA or revenue to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA or revenue multiples will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. 
 Income Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a combination of a yield calibration approach and a comparable investment approach. The yield calibration approach incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. The comparable investment approach utilizes and average yield-to-maturity of a selected set of high-quality, liquid investments to determine a comparable investment discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Value in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our Level III investments as of September 30, 2024. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Sales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method. 
 Interest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in our portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal balance on the capitalization date and is generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized PIK interest from investments of approximately 2.0 million and 6.4 million, respectively, and PIK dividends from investments of 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 less than 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized PIK interest from investments of approximately 1.7 million and 4.4 million, respectively, and no PIK dividend income. 
 Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such are amounts are deemed collectible. 
 Non-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate collectability. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no investments were on non-accrual status. 
 Fee income: Fee income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after trade date. Fee income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received by us for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment, and are non-refundable. Income received in exchange for the provision of services such as recurring administration services are also recognized as fee income in the period in which it was earned. 
 
 Monitoring of Portfolio Investments 
 We monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy. Our portfolio monitoring procedures are designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive analysis of our portfolio companies based on their operating performance and underlying business characteristics, which in turn forms the basis of its Risk Rating (as defined below). 
 We use an investment risk rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. As such, we assign each investment a composite score ("Risk Rating") based on two metrics 1) Operating Performance and 2) Business Characteristics: 
 Operating Performance assesses the health of the investment in context of its financial performance and the market environment it faces. The metric is expressed in Tiers of "1" to "4", with "4" being the best and "1" being the worst: 
 Tier 4 Business performance is in-line with or above expectations 
 Tier 3 Moderate business underperformance and/or moderate market headwinds 
 Tier 2 Significant business underperformance and/or significant market headwinds 
 Tier 1 Severe business underperformance and/or severe market headwinds 
 Business Characteristics assesses the health of the investment in context of the underlying portfolio company's business and credit quality, the underlying portfolio company's current balance sheet, and the level of support from the equity sponsor. The metric is expressed as on a qualitative scale of "A" to "C", with "A" being the best and "C" being the worst. 
 The Risk Rating for each investment is a composite of these two metrics. The Risk Rating is expressed in categories of Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, with Green reflecting an investment that is in-line with or above expectations and Red reflecting an investment performing materially below expectations. The mapping of the composite scores to these categories are below: 
 Green 4C, 3B, 2A, 4B, 3A, and 4A (e.g., Tier 4 for Operating Performance and C for Business Characteristics) 
 Yellow 3C, 2B, and 1A 
 Orange 2C and 1B 
 Red 1C

 Our total investment income increased by approximately 5.1 million, or 13 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of approximately 42.8 million consisted of approximately 38.3 million in cash interest from investments, approximately 2.0 million in PIK interest from investments, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately 0.8 million, less than 0.1 million in PIK dividends from investments, and approximately 1.7 million in fee income. The increase in total interest income of approximately 4.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a higher total invested portfolio balance. Fee income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to upfront, amendment and consent fees received from twenty-one different portfolio companies.

 Our total net operating expenses increased by approximately 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our management fee increased by 0.4 million, which was attributable to larger managed and invested capital balances as a result of the shares issued through the DRIP and higher drawn balances on the Wells Credit Facility. 
 Interest and other financing expenses increased by approximately 2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher SOFR rates on higher average drawn balances on the Wells Credit Facility. 
 Professional fees, administrative expenses and other general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 remained relatively flat.

As movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations, we look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a realized loss in TMK Hawk Parent, Corp. and the overall decrease in fair value of our investments during the period. The net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the overall increase in fair value of our investments during the period. 
 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Borrowings and Contractual Obligations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes. 
 We expect to generate cash flows from investments and operations and borrowings from banks or other lenders. We will seek to enter into any bank debt, credit facility or other financing arrangements on at least customary market terms; however, we cannot assure you we will be able to do so. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 The Investment Adviser, as our initial stockholder, authorized us to adopt the application of the modified asset coverage ratio pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, which resulted in the reduction of the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to us from 200.0 to 150.0 . In connection with their subscriptions of the shares, our stockholders were required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150.0 . In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150.0 after such borrowing (which means we can borrow 2 for every 1 of our equity). As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 294.80 . 
 On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had aggregate capital commitments and undrawn capital commitments from investors as follows: 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Capital Commitments 690.0 690.0 Unfunded Capital Commitments of Capital Commitments funded 100.0 100.0 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 16.3 million and 22.2 million, respectively. Our cash (used in) provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was approximately (72.9) million and 35.7 million, respectively. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. We may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to third parties to fund investments totaling 204.6 million and 112.6 million, respectively, under various undrawn revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments. 
 We may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitment letters to purchase investments in the aggregate par amount of 26.9 million and 6.8 million, respectively, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments which could require funding in the future.

 Contractual Obligations 
 A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Wells Credit Facility (1) 500.9 500.9 
 
 (1) Under the terms of the Wells Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility 500.9 million as of September 30, 2024) must be repaid on or before December 1, 2028. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 99.1 million of possible capacity remaining under the Wells Credit Facility. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 6. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for material details on the Wells Credit Facility. 
 We have entered into the investment management agreement, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Investment Management Agreement") with the Investment Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser has agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay a management fee for these services. 
 We have also entered into an administration agreement (the "Administration Agreement") with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator arranges office space for us and provides office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and other administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations. The Administrator has also maintains, or oversees the maintenance of, our financial records, our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 If any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that are entered into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement. 
 
 Distributions and Dividends 
 Distributions declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 totaled approximately 88.9 million and 76.2 million, respectively. 
 Tax characteristics of all distributions paid are reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total distributions declared were 105.4 million and 72.6 million, respectively, of which the distributions were comprised of approximately 98.96 and 96.94 respectively, of ordinary income, 1.04 and 3.06 , respectively, of long-term capital gains and 0.00 and 0.00 , respectively, of a return of capital. Future distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board. 
 We intend to pay semi-annual distributions to our stockholders in amounts sufficient to qualify as and maintain our status as a RIC. We intend to distribute approximately all of our net investment income on a semi-annual basis and substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment. 
 We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan (as amended from time to time, the "DRIP"), on behalf of our common stockholders, pursuant to which each of our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless the stockholder elects to receive cash. We will only use newly-issued shares of common stock to implement the DRIP. On August 16, 2022, our Board amended and restated the DRIP, effective as of September 18, 2022 (the "Amendment"). The Amendment clarifies that by "opting out" a stockholder may elect to receive some or all of their dividends or distributions in cash. Additionally, the notice requirement for stockholders to withdraw or modify their elections under the DRIP was amended such that a stockholder must notify the Company's transfer agent and registrar of any changes to their election no later than the day before the start of the quarterly period for which the stockholder desires to receive some or all of the dividend or distribution in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we issued 11,017,557 and 8,631,890 shares through the DRIP, respectively. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding our dividend reinvestment plan.

 Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, as amended, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement. 
 We have entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges our office space and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. 
 We, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a Trademark License Agreement with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has granted us, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the "NMF" name. 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal Code of Ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act and the Maryland General Corporation Law. 
 The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to our investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the "Exemptive Order"), which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits us to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our Independent Directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. The Exemptive Order was amended on August 30, 2022 to permit us to complete follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions. As our assets are treated as "plan assets" under ERISA, we will only co-invest in the same issuer with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates, so long as their and our respective future investments are at the same level of such issuer's capital structure; provided, that in no event will we co-invest with any other fund or entity in contravention of the 1940 Act. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5. Agreements and Related Parties in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Federal Reserve was periodically raising interest rates to combat inflation and maintained the same rate benchmark from July 2023 to September 2024. While the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 for the first time since March 2020, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. In a high interest rate environment, our net investment income would increase due to an increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. However, our cost of funds would also increase, which could also impact net investment income. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result in a recession in the United States, which would likely decrease interest rates. Alternatively, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of base rates, such as SOFR, to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain of the loans held in our portfolio had SOFR interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 99.6 of our investments at fair value (excluding unfunded debt investments) represent floating-rate investments with a SOFR floor (includes investments bearing prime interest rate contracts) and approximately 0.4 of our investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. Additionally, our Wells Credit Facility is also subject to floating interest rates and is currently paid based on floating SOFR rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense, should interest rates decrease by 200, 150, 100 or 50 basis points, or increase by 50, 100, 150 or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our Wells Credit Facility. For our credit facility, we use the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. This analysis does not take into account the impact of other expenses. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. 
 Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table. 
 Change in Interest Rates Estimated Percentage Change in Interest Income Net of Interest Expense (unaudited) -200 Basis Points (16.38) -150 Basis Points (12.29) -100 Basis Points (8.19) -50 Basis Points (4.10) +50 Basis Points 4.10 +100 Basis Points 8.19 +150 Basis Points 12.29 +200 Basis Points 16.38

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
