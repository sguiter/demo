 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 1. Organization of the Trust 
 Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust (the Trust is a statutory trust formed in June 2011 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to an initial trust agreement by and among Chesapeake Energy Corporation Chesapeake ), as Trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the Trustee ), and The Corporation Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the Delaware Trustee and, together with the Trustee, the Trustees ). 
 On December 11, 2020, Tapstone Energy, LLC Tapstone acquired 23,750,000 common units and the Underlying Properties (as defined below) from Chesapeake in a transaction under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2020, by and among Chesapeake, Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., Chesapeake E&P Holding, L.L.C. and Tapstone, Tapstone agreed to assume all duties and obligations of Chesapeake and its subsidiaries under each of the Trust Agreement (as defined below), the administrative services agreement, the royalty conveyances and the registration rights agreement following the divestiture by Chesapeake of the Underlying Properties (as defined below) and 23,750,000 common units. On December 7, 2021, Tapstone Energy Holdings, LLC, the parent of Tapstone Tapstone Holdings ), merged with Diversified Energy Company PLC Diversified ), the parent of Diversified Production LLC Diversified Production ), resulting in Tapstone Holdings and Tapstone becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Diversified (the Merger ). Following the Merger, the 23,750,000 common units previously held by Tapstone were transferred to Diversified Production and duties previously performed by Tapstone and its subsidiaries with respect to the Trust are now performed by Diversified. The 23,750,000 common units were subsequently transferred in the third quarter of 2023 to DP Bluegrass LLC, another indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Diversified. 
 The Trust was created to own royalty interests (the Royalty Interests for the benefit of Trust unitholders pursuant to a trust agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, and subsequently amended and restated as of November 16, 2011, by and among Tapstone (as successor to Chesapeake and Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake), the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (the Trust Agreement ). The Royalty Interests are derived from Diversified s interests in the specified oil and natural gas properties located within an area of mutual interest (the AMI in the Colony Granite Wash play in Washita County in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma (the Underlying Properties ). Chesapeake conveyed the Royalty Interests to the Trust from (a) Chesapeake s interests in 69 existing horizontal wells (the Producing Wells and (b) Chesapeake s interests in 118 horizontal development wells (the Development Wells that have since been drilled pursuant to a development agreement that was fulfilled by June 30, 2016, on properties held by Chesapeake within the AMI. 
 The business and affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee. The Trust Agreement limits the Trust s business activities generally to owning the Royalty Interests and any activity reasonably related to such ownership, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the conveyances related to the Royalty Interests. The Royalty Interests in the Producing Wells entitle the Trust to receive 90 of the proceeds (exclusive of any production or development costs but after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids NGL production attributable to Diversified s net revenue interest in the Producing Wells. The Royalty Interests in the Development Wells entitle the Trust to receive 50 of the proceeds (exclusive of any production or development costs but after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to Diversified s net revenue interest in the Development Wells. 
 The Trust will dissolve and begin to liquidate on June 30, 2031 (the Termination Date ), or earlier upon the first to occur of the below events 
 The Trust sells all of the Royalty Interests 
 The aggregate quarterly cash distribution amounts for any four consecutive quarters is less than 1.0 million 
 The holders of the majority of the Trust units and a majority of the common units (excluding common units owned by Diversified and its affiliates), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present, vote in favor of dissolution except that at any time during which

 Diversified and its affiliates collectively own less than 10 of the outstanding Trust units, the standard for approval will be a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by Diversified and its affiliates voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present notwithstanding the foregoing, there are conflicting interpretations that the Trust Agreement requires the exclusion of the common units owned by Diversified and its affiliates in a vote following Tapstone's acquisition of the Underlying Properties from Chesapeake even if Diversified and its affiliates own over 10 of the outstanding Trust units or 
 The Trust is judicially dissolved. 
 At the Termination Date, (a) 50 of the total Royalty Interests conveyed by Chesapeake will revert automatically to Diversified and (b) 50 of the total Royalty Interests conveyed by Chesapeake (the Perpetual Royalties will be retained by the Trust and thereafter sold. The net proceeds of the sale of the Perpetual Royalties, as well as any remaining Trust cash reserves, will be distributed to the unitholders on a pro rata basis. Diversified will have a right of first refusal to purchase the Perpetual Royalties retained by the Trust at the Termination Date. 
 The Trust's common units now trade under the symbol CHKR on the Pink Open Market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (the OTC Pink ). The OTC Pink is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE and the quotation of the Trust's common units on the OTC Pink may result in less demand compared to the NYSE and could diminish interest in the Trust from investors, analysts and other market participants. 
 
 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
 Basis of Accounting . The accompanying unaudited Statements of Assets and Trust Corpus as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the unaudited interim Statements of Distributable Income and of Changes in Trust Corpus of the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the Current Quarter and the Current Period , respectively) and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the Prior Quarter and the Prior Period , respectively) have been presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Trustee, necessary to fairly state the Trust's financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2023 audited financial statements and notes of the Trust, included in the Trust s 2023 Form 10-K. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the SEC instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all disclosures required for financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 
 Financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, as the Trust records revenues when received and expenses when paid and may also establish certain cash reserves for contingencies which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12 E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts . 
 Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the Trust s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the Trust s financial statements. 
 Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements requires the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and Trust corpus during the reporting period. Management applies significant judgement in developing the estimates of reserve volumes including estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and their values, future production rates and commodity pricing differentials. The estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves have been developed by specialists, specifically petroleum engineers. These reserves are used to compute the Trust's amortization of the Investment in Royalty Interests (as defined in Investment in Royalty Interests below) and, as necessary, to evaluate potential impairments of Investment in Royalty Interests. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CHESAPEAKE GRANITE WASH TRUST 
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
 (Unaudited) 

 Risks and Uncertainties. The Trust's revenue and distributions are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, each of which depends on numerous factors beyond the Trust's control such as economic conditions, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future, which have an impact on revenues and distributable income. The Trust does not have the ability to enter into derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of this price volatility. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash equivalents include all highly-liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. The Trustee maintains a minimum cash reserve of 1.0 million and may, at the Trustee s discretion, reserve funds for future expected administrative expenses. Cash maintained at financial institutions may at times exceed federally insured amounts, but the Trust does not expect to be exposed to any significant risks related thereto. 
 Investment in Royalty Interests . The Investment in Royalty Interests is amortized as a single cost center on a units-of-production basis over total proved reserves. Such amortization does not reduce distributable income, rather it is charged directly to Trust corpus. Revisions to estimated future units-of-production are treated on a prospective basis beginning on the date such revisions are known. The carrying value of the Trust s Investment in Royalty Interests will not necessarily be indicative of the fair value of such Royalty Interests. The Trust is not burdened by development costs of the Royalty Interests. 
 On a quarterly basis, the Trust evaluates the carrying value of the Investment in Royalty Interests under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, the carrying value of the Investment in Royalty Interests may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value (using a 10 discount rate) of the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves. The Trust recognized no impairment of the Royalty Interests in the Current Quarter or the Current Period. 
 Revenues and Expenses. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee is responsible for, or has any control over, any operating or capital costs of the Underlying Properties. The Trust s revenues with respect to the Royalty Interests in the Underlying Properties are net of existing royalties and overriding royalties associated with Diversified's interests and are determined after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes associated with the Royalty Interests. Royalty Income (and associated Production Taxes and post-production costs) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 generally includes royalties attributable to sales of oil, natural gas and NGL related to production from March 1, 2024 to May 31, 2024 and September 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024, respectively. Post-production expenses generally consist of costs incurred to gather, store, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the oil, natural gas and NGL produced. However, the Trust is not responsible for costs of marketing services provided by Diversified or Diversified affiliates. Cash distributions to unitholders are reduced by the Trust's administrative expenses. 
 Trust administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 generally include administrative expense related to invoices paid between the periods of May 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024 and November 1, 2023 to July 31, 2024, respectively. Trust administrative expenses also includes a change in cash advance that estimates three months of subsequent Trust administration expense payments each quarter. 
 
 3. Income Taxes 
 The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust is not required to pay federal or state income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income tax has been made. 
 Trust unitholders are treated as partners of the Trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust Agreement contains tax provisions that generally allocate the Trust s income, deductions and credits among the Trust unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests in the Trust. The Trust Agreement also sets forth the tax accounting principles to be applied by the Trust.

 4. Related Party Transactions 
 Trustee Administrative Fee . Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust is required to pay an annual administrative fee of 175,000 to the Trustee, paid in equal quarterly installments. The administrative fee may be adjusted for inflation by no more than 3 in any calendar year beginning in 2015. To date, the Trustee's annual administrative fees have been adjusted upward by a total of 20.4 from the original fee including 2023 and 2024 increases of 3.0 for both years, to the current annual amount of 210,712. 
 Agreements with Diversified. In connection with the initial public offering and the conveyance of the Royalty Interests to the Trust, the Trust entered into an administrative services agreement, a development agreement and a registration rights agreement with Chesapeake which were assumed by Tapstone and ultimately Diversified. 
 Pursuant to the administrative services agreement, Diversified provides the Trust with certain accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and information services related to the Royalty Interests and the registration rights agreement. In return for the services provided by Diversified under the administrative services agreement, the Trust pays Diversified, in equal quarterly installments, an annual fee of 200,000, which will remain fixed for the life of the Trust. Diversified is also entitled to receive reimbursement for its actual out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of any of the services under the administrative services agreement. 
 The administrative services agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the date the Trust shall have dissolved and wound up its business and affairs in accordance with the Trust Agreement, (b) the date that all of the Royalty Interests have been terminated or are no longer held by the Trust, (c) with respect to services to be provided with respect to any Underlying Properties transferred by Diversified to a third party, the date that either Diversified or the Trustee may designate by delivering 90-days prior written notice, provided that the drilling obligation has been completed and the transferee of such Underlying Properties assumes responsibility to perform the services in place of Diversified, or (d) a date mutually agreed upon by Diversified and the Trustee. 
 The Trust also entered into a registration rights agreement for the benefit of Diversified (a holder ). Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the Trust agreed to register the Trust units held by such holder for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under certain circumstances. In connection with the preparation and filing of any registration statement, Diversified will bear all costs and expenses incidental to such registration statement, excluding certain internal expenses of the Trust, which will be borne by the Trust, and any underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be borne by the seller of the Trust units. 
 Loan Commitment . Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, if at any time the Trust s cash on hand (including available cash reserves, if any) is not sufficient to pay the Trust s ordinary course expenses as they become due, Diversified will loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any funds loaned by Diversified pursuant to this commitment will be limited to the payment of current accounts payable or other obligations to trade creditors in connection with obtaining goods or services or the payment of other current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Trust s business, and may not be used to satisfy Trust indebtedness for borrowed money of the Trust. If Diversified loans funds pursuant to this commitment, no further distributions will be made to unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly cash distribution amount and unless Diversified otherwise consents in writing) until such loan is repaid. There were no loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 5. Distributions to Unitholders 
 The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting the Trust s expenses, approximately 60 days following the completion of each quarter, and is required to do so under the Trust Agreement, through (and including) the quarter ending June 30, 2031. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust declared and paid the following cash distributions

After the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Trust will no longer voluntarily file periodic reports or other information with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Although we will cease filing reports with the SEC, we intend to make financial and certain other information regarding the Trust available on the investors section of our corporate website, http chkgranitewashtrust.com , in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust, and to cause such information also to be posted through the OTC Disclosure & News Services that is operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. OTC Markets ). The Trust s common units have been quoted for trading on the OTC Markets Pink Open Market OTC Pink since March 2, 2020, and the Trust 
 7 

anticipates that the common units will remain quoted on the OTC Pink under the current symbol CHKR . By electing to cease voluntary filing reports with the SEC, the Trust expects to experience a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to the lower costs involved with preparing and disseminating annual and quarterly financial information to unitholders in a manner that reflects the current status of the Trust. 
 
 Geopolitical Events 
 We are actively monitoring the military conflicts in Ukraine and in Israel and surrounding countries, and assessing their impact on the Trust s business. To date, we have not experienced any material interruptions to our business given that the Underlying Properties are exclusively located within the United States. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant, including significant volatility in commodity prices, supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, including inflation, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage, each of which could have a substantial impact on the global economy and consequently our business for an unknown period of time. We currently do not expect any material impact on the Trust s business, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition however, we have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel as the conflicts, and any resulting government reactions, are rapidly developing and beyond our control. 
 Overview 
 The Trust is a statutory trust formed in June 2011 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The business and affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee and, as necessary, the Delaware Trustee. The Trust does not conduct any operations or activities other than owning the Royalty Interests and activities related to such ownership. The Trust s purpose is generally to own the Royalty Interests, to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the Royalty Interests and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the Royalty Interests and the Trust units. The Trust derives all or substantially all of its income and cash flow from the Royalty Interests. The Trust is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 The Royalty Interests entitle the Trust to receive 90 of the proceeds (after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids NGL attributable to Diversified s net revenue interest in the Producing Wells and 50 of the proceeds (after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to Diversified s net revenue interest in the Development Wells. Post-production expenses generally consist of costs incurred to gather, store, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the oil, natural gas and NGL produced. However, the Trust is not responsible for costs of marketing services provided by Diversified or Diversified affiliates. 
 
 The Trust is required to make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting the Trust s administrative expenses, on or about 60 days following the completion of each calendar quarter through (and including) the quarter ending June 30, 2031. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, distributions were paid on February 29, 2024, May 30, 2024 and August 29, 2024. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below and Note 5 to the financial statements contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report for more information regarding these distributions. 
 The amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions to Trust unitholders fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on several factors, including, but not limited to 
 
 Timing and amount of production and sales from the Development and Producing Wells 
 Oil, natural gas and NGL prices received 
 Volumes of oil, natural gas and NGL produced and sold 
 Certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes and 
 The Trust s expenses.

Results of Trust Operations 
 The quarterly payments to the Trust with respect to the Royalty Interests are based on the amount of proceeds actually received by Diversified during the preceding calendar quarter. Proceeds from production are typically received by Diversified in the month following the month of production. Due to the timing of the payment of production proceeds, quarterly distributions made by Diversified to the Trust generally include royalties attributable to sales of oil, natural gas and NGL for three months, comprised of the first two months of the quarter just ended and the last month of the quarter prior to that one. Diversified is required to make the Royalty Interest payments to the Trust within 35 days after the end of each calendar quarter. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust received payments on the Royalty Interests representing royalties attributable to proceeds from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL for the period from September 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024. 
 The Trust's revenues and distributable income available to unitholders have been adversely affected throughout 2023, and to date in 2024, by a decrease in production. Additionally, decreases in commodity prices through the six months ended June 30, 2024 also adversely affected the Trust's revenues and distributable income available. However, total average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent boe has increased since the beginning of the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the Current Quarter ). Due to natural declines, the Trust expects production to continue to decline and expects distributable income to continue to be adversely affected. 
 The Trust's Investment in Royalty Interests is subject to a quarterly full cost ceiling test. The Trust recognized no impairment of the Royalty Interests in the Current Quarter or the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the Current Period ).

 The 113,000 increase in distributable income during the Current Quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the total trust administrative expenses as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the Prior Quarter ). 
 
 The 3.66 million decrease in distributable income during the Current Period was primarily due to decreases in total sales volumes and total average realized price per boe as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the Prior Period ).

 (a) Net of certain post-production expenses. 
 (b) Includes the impact of certain post-production expenses but excludes production taxes. 
 The decrease in royalty income during the Current Quarter is primarily attributable to natural production declines in the production period from March 1, 2024 to May 31, 2024 (the Current Production Quarter as compared to the production period from March 1, 2023 to May 31, 2023 (the Prior Production Quarter ). Lower sales volumes in the Current Production Quarter decreased royalty income by approximately 407,000. This decrease was partly offset by an increase of approximately 260,000 in royalty income due to an increase in the average price received per boe in the Current Production Quarter compared to the Prior Production Quarter, for a total decrease in royalty income of approximately 147,000 in the Current Production Quarter compared to the Prior Production Quarter. 
 The decrease in royalty income in the Current Period is primarily attributable to decreases in commodity pricing and production declines, which were exacerbated by a deep freeze during January 2024 in Oklahoma. The decrease in the average price received per boe in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period resulted in a decrease of approximately 1.68 million in royalty income. Lower sales volumes in the Current Period decreased royalty income by approximately 2.20 million, for a total decrease in royalty income of approximately 3.88 million in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period.

Production taxes are calculated as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, net of any applicable tax credits. The decreases in production taxes in the Current Quarter and Current Period compared to the Prior Quarter and Prior Period relates primarily to a decrease in royalty income.

 (a) Includes a change in cash advances resulting in a 75,000 increase and a 225,000 increase in administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Trust administrative expenses primarily consist of the administrative fees paid to the Trustees and Diversified, as well as costs for accounting and legal services. The decrease in expenses in the Current Quarter is primarily related to a net decrease in the cash advance. The slight increase in expenses in the Current Period is primarily related to increased accounting and legal expenses offset by a net decrease in cash advances. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Trust s principal sources of liquidity and capital are cash flows generated from the Royalty Interests and the loan commitment as described above. The Trust s primary uses of cash are distributions to Trust unitholders, payments of production taxes, payments of Trust administrative expenses, including any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities and repayment of loans and payments of expense reimbursements to Diversified for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Trust. Administrative expenses include payments to the Trustees, as well as a quarterly fee of 50,000 to Diversified pursuant to an administrative services agreement. Each quarter, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the Royalty Interests during the quarter, over the Trust s expenses for the quarter and any cash reserve for the payment of liabilities of the Trust. The Trust does not undertake or control any capital projects or capital expenditures. These capital expenditures, if any, are controlled and paid by Diversified. 
 The Trust s revenue and distributions are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, each of which depends on numerous factors beyond the Trust s control such as economic conditions, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. We expect to see continued volatility in oil and natural gas prices for the foreseeable future, and such volatility has impacted and is expected to continue to impact Diversified s business, financial condition and results of operations and proceeds to the Trust and the Trust s reserves and quarterly cash distributions to unitholders . The Trust does not have the ability to enter into derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of this price volatility. 
 The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted amount of the cash reserve at any time, and may increase or decrease the rate at which it is withholding funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance notice to the unitholders. Without limiting the foregoing, the Trustee has reviewed the adequacy and sufficiency of the existing cash reserve and determined that, commencing with the distribution to unitholders for the fourth quarter 2021, which was paid in March 2022, the Trustee began withholding the funds otherwise available for distribution to the unitholders each quarter to increase existing cash reserves by a total of approximately 3,200,000 over a period of several quarters. Cash held in reserve will be invested as required by the Trust Agreement. Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary to pay or provide for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to unitholders, together with interest earned on the funds. As of September 30, 2024, 1,957,078 has been so withheld to increase cash reserves. 
 The Trust is required to make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting the Trust s administrative expenses, on or about 60 days following the completion of each calendar quarter through (and including) the quarter ending June 30, 2031. The 2024 third quarter distribution of 0.0202 per common unit, 
 11 

consisting of proceeds attributable to production from March 1, 2024 through May 31, 2024, (net of administrative expenses) was made on August 29, 2024 to record unitholders as of August 19, 2024. 
 On November 4, 2024, the Trust announced the November 2024 Distribution. The Trust's quarterly income available for distribution was 0.0267 per common unit consisting of proceeds attributable to production from June 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024 (net of administrative expenses). The distribution will be paid on November 29, 2024 to common unitholders of record as of November 19, 2024. All Trust unitholders share on a pro rata basis in the Trust's distributable income. 
 The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay Trust expenses that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from the Trustee as a lender provided the terms of the loan are fair to the Trust unitholders. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with itself, if the interest paid to the Trust at least equals amounts paid by the Trustee on similar deposits, and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. The Trustee may also hold funds awaiting distribution in a non-interest-bearing account. 
 Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, if at any time the Trust s cash on hand (including cash reserves, if any) is not sufficient to pay the Trust s ordinary course expenses as they become due, Diversified will loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any funds loaned by Diversified pursuant to this commitment will be limited to the payment of current accounts payable or other obligations to trade creditors in connection with obtaining goods or services or the payment of other current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Trust s business and may not be used to satisfy Trust indebtedness for borrowed money of the Trust. If Diversified loans funds pursuant to this commitment, unless Diversified agrees otherwise in writing, no further distributions may be made to unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly cash distribution amount) until such loan is repaid. There were no loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Critical accounting policies and estimates relating to the Trust are contained in Item 7 of Part II of the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

DISCLOSURES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements about the Trust and the Operator and other matters discussed herein that are subject to risks and uncertainties that are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this document are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements under Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this document regarding market factors, market prices , the proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves associated with the properties underlying the Royalty Interests, the Trust s or the Operator's future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and plans and objectives for future operations, information regarding target distributions, statements pertaining to future development activities and costs and information regarding production and reserve growth, statements regarding the continued trading of the Trust's common units on the Pink Open Market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (the OTC Pink ), statements regarding the geopolitical events, including the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the impact thereof on our and the Operator's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and actions by, or disputes among or between, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are forward-looking statements. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those projected. Our forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate, project, predict, believe, expect, anticipate, potential, could, may, foresee, seek, plan, goal, assume, target, should, intend, ability, will, would, forecast or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Trust, and by the Operator, in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with such expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors discussed in Item 1A of Part I of the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K and in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report and those set forth from time to time in the Trust s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), which could affect the future results of the energy industry in general, and the Trust and the Operator in particular, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. The actual results or developments anticipated may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, may not have the expected consequences to or effects on the Operator's business and the Trust. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive, and there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. The Trustee relies on the Operator for information regarding the Royalty Interests, the Underlying Properties and the Operator itself. The Trust undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by applicable law.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk relating to the Trust are contained in Item 7A of Part II of the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these risks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 The Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust is accumulated and communicated by Diversified to the Trustee, and its employees who participate in the preparation of the Trust s periodic reports as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Trustee has evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, the Trustee has concluded that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended) were effective. 
 Due to the nature of the Trust as a passive entity and in light of the contractual arrangements pursuant to which the Trust was created, including the provisions of (a) the Trust Agreement, (b) the administrative services agreement, (c) the development agreement and (d) the conveyances granting the Royalty Interests, the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures necessarily rely on (i) information provided by Diversified, including information relating to results of operations, the costs and revenues attributable to the Trust s interests under the conveyance and other operating and historical data, plans for future operating and capital expenditures, reserve information, information relating to projected production, and other information relating to the status and results of operations of the Underlying Properties and the Royalty Interests, and (ii) conclusions and reports regarding reserves by the Trust s independent reserve engineers. Although the Trustee does rely on Diversified to perform certain functions and to provide certain information that impact the Trust s financial statements, the Trustee remains responsible for evaluating, as appropriate, the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures as well as its internal control over financial reporting. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There were no changes in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. 
 14 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 There are no legal proceedings to which the Trust is a named party. However, the Trustee has been advised by Diversified that the Trust may from time to time be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business for certain matters that include the Royalty Interests. While Diversified has advised the Trustee that it does not presently believe any pending litigation will have a net material adverse effect to the Trust, in the event such matters are adjudicated or settled in a material amount and charges are made against royalty income, such charges could have a material impact on the Trust's future royalty income. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The other information set forth in this report should be read in conjunction with Item IA. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, in addition to the risk factor below. 
 
 The cessation of SEC reporting could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units on the OTC Pink, and if we were to fail to maintain current public information about the Trust, SEC rules could prevent brokers from posting quotes in the common units, which could harm the liquidity of the common units. 
 
 The Trust is a voluntary reporting company with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The Trust's common units have been quoted for trading on the OTC Pink since March 2, 2020 under the symbol CHKR. 
 
 After the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Trust will no longer voluntarily file periodic reports or other information with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Instead of filing such reports or other information with the SEC, we intend to make financial and certain other information regarding the Trust available on the investors section of our corporate website, http chkgranitewashtrust.com , in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust, and to cause such information to also be posted through the OTC Disclosure & News Services that is operated by the OTC Markets, in order to enable brokers to post quotes for the common units in compliance with amendments to Rule 15c2-11 Rule 15c2-11 that became effective on September 28, 2021 and have an impact on the over-the-counter OTC market regulatory structure. The stated purpose of the amendments to Rule 15c2-11 was to enhance disclosure and investor protection in the OTC Market by ensuring that broker-dealers in the OTC Market do not publish quotations for an issuer s security when current information regarding the issuer, as prescribed in Rule 15c2-11 current issuer information ), is not publicly available. Therefore, under amended Rule 15c2-11, a non-SEC reporting company must make publicly available current issuer information, including annual financial statements, in order to be publicly quoted on the OTC Markets. Otherwise, the company risks being downgraded to the grey markets, in which case brokers generally are not permitted to post quotes in the company s securities. 
 
 The Trust has historically relied on its SEC filings to satisfy Rule15c2-11 s current issuer information requirement. However, after the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Trust will no longer be able to rely on such SEC filings to satisfy the current issuer information requirements of Rule 15c2-11, and instead anticipates submitting current issuer information to the OTC Markets via the OTC Disclosure & News Services, as noted above. The cessation of the Trust's filings with the SEC may have an adverse impact on the posting of quotations for Trust common units by brokers and on the market price of the common units. Additionally, if we cannot or do not make publicly available current issuer information about the Trust, Rule 15c2-11 could prevent brokers from quoting the common units, in which case holders of common units may face difficulties in selling their common units. 
 
 ITEM 5. Other Information 
 
 (a) None. 
 
 (b) Not applicable. 
 
 (c) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no officer or employee of the Trustee who performs policy-making functions for the Trust adopted, terminated or modified any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or any non- 
 15 

Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K), with respect to the Trust's common units. The Trust does not have any directors (as defined in Section 3(a)(7) of the Exchange Act).
