 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU allows entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense. This also aligns the treatment of other tax equity investments with that allowed for low income housing tax credit LIHTC investments. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period. The Company already utilized the proportional amortization method for its LIHTC investment and early adopted ASU 2023-02 in conjunction with its initial investment in an investment tax credit producing solar property described in more detail in Note 6 Renewable Energy Tax Credit Investment . The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

Recently Issued but Not Adopted Accounting Guidance 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. Public entities are required to disclose significant expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment. Significant expense categories are derived from expenses that are regularly reported to an entity s chief operating decision-maker CODM and included in a segment s reported measures of profit or loss. Public entities are also required to disclose the title and position of the CODM and explain how the CODM uses the reported measures of profit or loss to assess segment performance. The ASU requires interim disclosures of certain segment-related disclosures that previously were only required annually. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the ASU should be applied prospectively. The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . Among other things, the ASU requires that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). In addition, the ASU requires information pertaining to taxes paid (net of refunds received) to be disaggregated for federal, state, and foreign taxes and further disaggregated for specific jurisdictions to the extent the related amounts are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

The Company has determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or do not apply to its operations.

The Company has not identified any specific available for sale securities in a loss position that it intends to sell in the near term and does not believe that it will be required to sell any such securities. The Company reviews its securities on a quarterly basis to assess declines in fair value for credit losses. Consideration is given to such factors as the credit rating of the borrower, market conditions such as current interest rates, any adverse conditions specific to the security, and delinquency status on contractual payments. At September 30, 2024, management concluded that in all instances, securities with fair values less than carrying value were due to fluctuations in interest rates and other factors; thus, no credit loss provision was required. 

In addition, management assesses held to maturity securities for credit losses on a quarterly basis. The assessment includes review of performance metrics, identification of delinquency and evaluation of market factors. In July 2024, a BHC whose subordinated debt the Company holds and is classified as held to maturity, having an amortized cost balance of 2.0 million, announced the suspension of its quarterly dividend. Based on this announcement, management performed additional research regarding the financial stability and strength of the BHC and underlying bank. Based on all analysis, management concluded the decline in fair value of all securities classified as held to maturity was due to changes in interest rates and other market factors. Accordingly, no credit loss provision was recorded in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

At September 30, 2024, the municipal obligations and U.S. government agency debt securities, including Treasury notes and bonds, agency notes and bonds, mortgage-backed securities and CMOs classified as available for sale and in a loss position had depreciated approximately from the amortized cost basis. All of the U.S. government agency securities and municipal obligations are issued by U.S. government agencies, government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, or are secured by first mortgage loans and municipal project revenues. At September 30, 2024, the corporate notes classified as held to maturity in a loss position had depreciated approximately from the amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses related principally to current interest rates for similar types of securities. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government, its agencies or other governments, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition. As the Company has the ability to hold the debt securities until maturity, or the foreseeable future if classified as available for sale, no credit loss is deemed to exist. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company estimated expected credit losses to be immaterial based on the composition of the held to maturity securities portfolio. 

While management does not anticipate any credit losses at September 30, 2024, additional deterioration in market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on credit quality in the future. 

There were no sales of available for sale securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized gross gains of and gross losses of on sales of available for sale securities. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized gross gains of and gross losses of on sales of available for sale securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized gross gains of and gross losses of on sales of available for sale securities and time deposits. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, with an aggregate book value greater that 10 of stockholders equity. 

Accrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was reported in a ccrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

Accrued interest receivable on held to maturity debt securities totaled at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

Equity Securities 

In September 2018, the Company acquired shares of common stock in another BHC, representing approximately of the outstanding common stock of the entity, for a total investment of million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized unrealized losses of and , respectively, on this equity investment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized unrealized losses of and , respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the equity investment had a fair value of and million, respectively, and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

In October 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to invest in a bank technology fund through a limited partnership. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s investment in the limited partnership was million and is reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The unfunded commitment related to the limited partnership investment at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively, and is reflected in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company expects to fulfill the commitment as capital calls are made through 2026. The investment is accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value, and has been recorded at cost, less any impairment, and adjustments resulting from observable price changes. There were no impairments or adjustments on equity securities without readily determinable fair values during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

In December 2015, the Company acquired Peoples Bancorp, Inc. of Bullitt County and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Peoples Bank of Bullitt County Peoples ), headquartered in Shepherdsville, Kentucky. Peoples owned Class B shares of VISA that were carried at an amortized costs basis of zero and were subsequently transferred to the Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold all the VISA Class B shares owned for a gross gain of .

The Allowance for Credit Losses ACL on loans is measured on a collective (pooled) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company s pools/segments are largely determined based on loan types as defined by Call Report instructions. The Company has identified and utilizes the following portfolio segments: 

1 4 Family Residential Mortgage 1 4 Family Residential Mortgage loans are primarily secured by 1-4 family residences that are owner-occupied and serve as the primary residence of the borrower. In addition, the Company typically has a senior (1st lien) position securing the collateral of loans in this portfolio. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by unemployment levels in the market area due to economic conditions. Repayment may also be impacted by changes in residential property values. 

Home Equity and Second Mortgage Home Equity and Second Mortgage loans and lines of credit are primarily secured by 1-4 family residences that are owner-occupied and serve as the primary residence of the borrower. However, the Company typically has a junior lien position securing the collateral of loans in this portfolio. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by unemployment levels in the market area due to economic conditions. Repayment may also be impacted by changes in residential property values. While secured by collateral similar to that of the 1 4 Family Residential Mortgage loans, loans within this segment are considered to carry elevated risk due to the Company s junior lien position on the underlying collateral property. 

Multi-family Residential Multi-family Residential loans are primarily secured by properties such as apartment complexes and other multi-tenant properties within the Company s market area. In some situations, the collateral may reside outside of the Company s typical market area. Repayment of these loans is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties and collection of associated rents. Repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. 

1 4 Family Residential Construction 1 4 Family Residential Construction loans are generally secured by 1-4 family residences that will be owner-occupied upon completion. Risks inherent in construction lending are related to the market value of the property held as collateral, the cost and timing of constructing or improving a property, movements in interest rates and the real estate market during the construction phase, and the ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by unemployment levels in the market area due to economic conditions. Repayment may also be impacted by changes in residential property values. 

Other Construction, Development and Land Other Construction, Development and Land loans include loans secured by multi-family properties, commercial projects, and vacant land. This portfolio includes both owner-occupied and speculative investment properties. Risks inherent in construction lending are related to the market value of the property held as collateral, the cost and timing of constructing or improving a property, the borrower s ability to use funds generated by a project to service a loan until a project is completed, movements in interest rates and the real estate market during the construction phase, and the ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing. 

Commercial Real Estate Commercial Real Estate loans are comprised of loans secured by various types of collateral including warehouses, retail space, and mixed-use buildings, among others, located in the Company s primary lending area. Risks related to commercial real estate lending are related to the market value of the property taken as collateral, the underlying cash flows, and general economic condition of the local real estate market. Repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the ability of the borrower to attract tenants at lease rates that provide for adequate debt service and can be impacted by local economic conditions which impact vacancy rates. The Company generally obtains loan guarantees from financially capable parties for Commercial Real Estate loans. To a lesser degree, this segment also includes loans secured by farmland. The risks associated with loans secured by farmland are related to the market value of the property taken as collateral and the underlying cash flows from farming operations and general economic conditions. 

Commercial Business Commercial Business loans include lines of credit to businesses, term loans and letters of credit secured by business assets such as equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, or other assets excluding real estate. Loans in this portfolio may also be unsecured and are generally made to finance capital expenditures or fund operations. Commercial Business loans contain risks related to the value of the collateral securing the loan and the repayment is primarily dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower. As with Commercial Real Estate loans, the Company generally obtains loan guarantees from financially capable parties for Commercial Business loans. 

Consumer and Other Loans Consumer and Other Loans consist mainly of loans secured by new and used automobiles and trucks, recreational vehicles such as boats and RVs, mobile homes and secured and unsecured loans to individuals. The risks associated with these loans are related to local economic conditions including the unemployment level. To a lesser degree, this segment also includes loans secured by lawn and farm equipment, well as farm output and loans secured by marketable securities. The risks associated with these loans are related to local economic conditions including the unemployment level, general economic conditions impacting crop prices, the supply chain and the fair value of the security collateral. 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. In addition, loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation. When management determines that foreclosure is probable or the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date adjusted for selling costs.

The Company utilizes a combination of the Open Pool/Snapshot and Weighted Average Remaining Maturity WARM methods in determining expected future credit losses. The Open Pool/Snapshot method takes a snapshot of a loan portfolio at a point in time in history and tracks that loan portfolio s performance in the subsequent periods until its ultimate disposition. The WARM method uses average annual charge-off rates and the remaining life of the loan to estimate the ACL. For the Company s loan portfolios, the remaining contractual life for each loan is adjusted by the expected scheduled payments and estimated prepayments. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the amortization adjusted remaining life of the loan to determine the unadjusted lifetime historical charge-off rate. The Company s expected loss estimate is anchored in historical credit loss experience, with an emphasis on all available portfolio data. The Company s historical look-back periods for the loan portfolio range from one to 10 years depending on the WARM of the given portfolio segment and are updated on an annual basis. 

The Company estimates the ACL on loans using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Reasonable and supportable forecasts typically utilize a 12-month period with immediate reversion to historical losses. Historical loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Qualitative adjustments to historical loss information are made for losses reflected by peers, changes in underwriting standards, changes in economic conditions, changes in delinquency levels, collateral values and other factors. 

Qualitative adjustments reflect management s overall estimate of the extent to which current expected credit losses on collectively evaluated loans will differ from historical loss experience. The analysis takes into consideration industry and collateral concentrations, acquired loan portfolio characteristics and other credit-related analytics as deemed appropriate. 

Management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the relevant historical loss experience and the qualitative factors. Management also monitors the differences between estimated and actual incurred loan losses in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the estimation process and make any changes in the methodology as necessary. 

Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. There have been no significant changes to the types of collateral securing the Company s collateral dependent loans.

Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, a term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or an interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the ACL on loans. In some cases, the Company may provide multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified Commercial Business loans with an amortized cost basis of million, or approximately of the amortized cost of all Commercial Business loans, for which the borrowers were experiencing financial distress. The modification for each loan was the modification of principal and interest payments for 12 months. No principal was forgiven, no payments were delayed, and no interest rates were reduced for the modified loans. This is the same relationship that was modified during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The previous modifications were to allow six months of interest only payments with the maturity dates of each loan also being extended. The Company monitors the performance of modified loans and none of the modified loans were delinquent at September 30, 2024. There were no modifications to borrowers in financial distress during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no loans to borrowers experiencing financial distress that were modified during the previous 12 months and which subsequently defaulted during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were no unfunded commitments associated with loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial distress as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Credit Quality Indicators 

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, public information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company classifies loans based on credit risk at least quarterly. The Company uses the following regulatory definitions for risk ratings: 

Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loss: Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance on the institution s books as an asset is not warranted. 

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the described process are considered to be pass rated loans. 

Based on the analysis performed at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows:

ACL on Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures 

The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The ACL for off-balance-sheet credit exposures was at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The ACL for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the ACL for off-balance-sheet credit exposures are reflected in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. There were no changes to the ACL for off-balance-sheet credit exposures during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

million in borrowings outstanding under the Federal Reserve Bank s FRB Bank Term Funding Program BTFP and no outstanding advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2023, the Company had million in borrowings outstanding under the FRB s BTFP and no outstanding advances from the FHLB. 

On March 12, 2023, the FRB created the BTFP to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions. The BTFP offered loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions and other depository institutions which pledged collateral, such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency notes and bonds and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. The collateral is valued at par, and advances under this program did not include any fees or prepayment penalties. In January 2024, the Company repaid all outstanding borrowings under the BTFP and advances from the FHLB and then borrowed million under the BTFP at a fixed rate of for a one -year period. At September 30, 2024, the pledged securities had a par value of million and a carrying value of million. Effective March 11, 2024, the BTFP ceased making new loans. 

FHLB advances are secured under a blanket collateral agreement.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had a million borrowing capacity limit with the FHLB based on pledged collateral. 

On February 28, 2024, the Bank entered into an Overdraft Line of Credit Agreement with the FHLB which established a line of credit not to exceed million secured under the blanket collateral agreement. This agreement expires on February 28, 2025. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the agreement. 

The Company did not utilize FHLB advances during the three month period ended September 30, 2024. During the three month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company utilized a series of short-term fixed-rate bullet and variable rate advances from the FHLB in order to meet daily liquidity requirements and to fund growth in earning assets. The fixed-rate bullet advances had an average term of seven days. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company utilized a series of short-term fixed-rate bullet and variable rate advances from the FHLB in order to meet daily liquidity requirements and to fund growth in earning assets. The fixed-rate bullet advances had an average term of seven days.

shares and shares were still available for issuance under the 2009 Plan at its termination. 

On May 22, 2019, the Company adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan ). The 2019 Plan provides for the award of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares and stock appreciation rights. The aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan may not exceed shares. If an award under the 2009 Plan is canceled, terminates, expires, is forfeited or lapses for any reason, any issued shares subject to the award shall not be available for issuance pursuant to awards subsequently granted under the 2019 Plan. Further, no additional participants, as that term is defined in the 2009 Plan, are eligible for grants of awards under the 2009 Plan. The Company generally issues new shares under the 2019 Plan from its authorized but unissued shares. 

At September 30, 2024, shares of the Company s common stock were available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. The Company may grant both non-statutory and statutory stock options which may not have a term exceeding ten years. In the case of incentive stock options, the aggregate fair value of the stock (determined at the time the incentive stock option is granted) for which any optionee may be granted incentive options which are first exercisable during any calendar year shall not exceed . Option prices may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of the grant. An award of a performance share is a grant of a right to receive shares of the Company s common stock which is contingent upon the achievement of specific performance criteria or other objectives set at the grant date. Stock appreciation rights are equity or cash settled share-based compensation arrangements whereby the number of shares that will ultimately be issued or the cash payment is based upon the appreciation of the Company s common stock. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, any other award granted under the 2019 Plan. The terms of the 2019 Plan also include provisions whereby all unearned options and restricted shares become immediately exercisable and fully vested upon a change in control. 

As of September 30, 2024, no stock options had been granted under the Plans. 

Compensation expense is measured based on the fair market value of the restricted stock at the grant date and is recognized ratably over the period during which the shares are earned (the vesting period). The Company accounts for any forfeitures when they occur, and any previously recognized compensation for an award is reversed in the period the award is forfeited. Compensation expense related to restricted stock recognized for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 amounted to and , respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted stock recognized for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 amounted to and , respectively. The total income tax expense related to stock-based compensation was and , for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation was and , for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Level 2: 

Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs that are derived principally from or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3: 

Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. The table below presents the balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed models or obtained from third parties that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters or a matrix pricing model that employs the Bond Market Association s standard calculations for cash flow and price/yield analysis and observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, or the lower of cost or fair value. These adjustments may include unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments have been applied consistently over time. The Company s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Company s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 

Securities Available for Sale and Equity Securities . Securities classified as available for sale and equity securities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are classified as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy where quoted market prices from reputable third-party brokers are available in an active market. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. These securities are reported using Level 2 inputs and the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, U.S. government and agency yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the security s terms and conditions, among other factors. For securities where quoted market prices, market prices of similar securities or prices from an independent third-party pricing service are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators and are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in fair value of securities available for sale are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of income tax effect. Changes in fair value of equity securities are recorded in noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income. 

Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value. The portfolio is comprised of residential real estate loans and fair value is estimated based on specific prices of underlying contracts for sales to investors. These measurements are carried at Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any loans held for sale measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

Collateral Dependent Loans . Collateral dependent loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. In accordance with accounting standards, only collateral dependent loans for which a specific ACL has been established require classification in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of collateral dependent loans is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Collateral dependent loans with specific allocations of ACL are measured at the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets, including equipment, inventory and/or accounts receivable. The fair value of the collateral is generally determined based on real estate appraisals or other independent evaluations by qualified professionals, which are then discounted to reflect management s estimate of the fair value of the collateral given the current market conditions and the condition of the collateral. 

At September 30, 2024, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral dependent loans included a discount from appraised value for estimates of changes in market conditions, the condition of the collateral and estimated costs to sell the collateral ranging from to , with a weighted average discount of . The Company recognized provisions for credit losses on collateral dependent loans of for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized provisions for credit losses on collateral dependent loans of million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized a 2,000 reduction in provisions for credit losses on collateral dependent impaired loans for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

There have been no changes in the valuation techniques and related inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis during the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were no transfers into or out of the Company s Level 3 financial assets for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

GAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows:

The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value are described as follows: 

Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and payable, demand deposits and other transactions accounts. The fair value of securities and interest-bearing time deposits in other financial institutions is based on quoted market prices (where available) or values obtained from an independent pricing service. The fair value of loans, excluding loans held for sale, fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and borrowed funds is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk of the instrument. The fair value of loans held for sale is based on specific prices of underlying contracts for sales to investors. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB and other restricted stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. The methods utilized to measure the fair value of financial instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 represent an approximation of exit price, but an actual exit price may differ.

A description of the Company s revenue streams accounted for under FASB ASC 606 follows: 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts : The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as stop payment charges and statement rendering, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer's request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. 

ATM and Debit Card Fees : The Company earns ATM usage fees and interchange fees from debit cardholder transactions conducted through a payment network. ATM fees are recognized at the point in time the transaction occurs. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. 

Investment Advisory Income : The Company earns trust, insurance commissions, brokerage commissions and annuities income from its contracts with customers to manage assets for investment, and/or to transact on their accounts. These fees are primarily earned over time as the Company provides the contracted services and are generally assessed based on the market value of assets under management. Fees that are transaction based, including trade execution services, are recognized at the point in time that the transaction is executed. Other related fees, which are based on a fixed fee schedule, are recognized when the services are rendered. 

Other Income : Other income from contracts with customers includes safe deposit box fees and ACH origination fees. This revenue is recognized at the time the transaction is executed or over the period the Company satisfies the performance obligation.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 

Total assets increased 31.4 million from 1.16 billion at December 31, 2023 to 1.19 billion at September 30, 2024. 

Net loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale) increased 16.2 million from 614.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 630.6 million at September 30, 2024. Commercial real estate, 1-4 family residential mortgage, and other construction, development and land loan increases of 7.8 million, 7.6 million, and 6.4 million, respectively, were partially offset by decreases of 4.8 million and 3.6 million in commercial business and 1-4 family residential construction, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased from 38.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 89.9 million at September 30, 2024 primarily due to maturities of available for sale securities, increased borrowings under the FRB s BTFP and net deposit inflows at the Bank. 

Securities available for sale decreased 28.8 million from 437.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 408.5 million at September 30, 2024. Purchases of 47.8 million of securities classified as available for sale were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of U.S. government agency CMOs and municipal bonds. Principal payments and maturities of available for sale securities totaled 17.8 million and 46.2 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Securities classified as available for sale totaling 19.2 million were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of municipal bonds. In addition, there was an unrealized gain of 7.3 million on the securities available for sale portfolio during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to decreasing market interest rates. 

Total deposits increased 5.0 million but remained at 1.03 billion at December 31, 2023 and September 30 2024, respectively. Interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts and non-interest-bearing checking accounts decreased 19.4 million, 12.4 million and 5.7 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while time deposits increased 42.6 million during the period. Deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions, and fluctuations in our customers' own liquidity needs and may also be influenced by recent developments in the financial services industry. Significant competition for deposits driven by high interest rate alternatives for depositors is currently impacting deposit fluctuations and increasing our cost of deposits. 

The Company had 33.6 million and 21.5 million in borrowings outstanding from the FRB under the BTFP at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company utilized a series of short-term fixed-rate bullet and variable rate advances from the FHLB and the BTFP in order to meet daily liquidity requirements and to fund growth in earning assets. 

Total stockholders' equity attributable to the Company increased from 105.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 116.8 million at September 30, 2024, due to a 5.9 million increase in retained net income as well as a 5.5 million net unrealized gain on available for sale securities. The net unrealized gain on available for sale securities during the period is primarily due to decreased market interest rates.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 FIRST CAPITAL, INC. 

Results of Operations for the Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net income. Net income attributable to the Company was 2.9 million 0.87 per diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.1 million 0.94 per diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net interest income. Net interest income after provision for credit losses increased 415,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Total interest income increased 2.0 million when comparing the periods due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets from 3.96 for the third quarter of 2023 to 4.53 for the third quarter of 2024. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased from 1.13 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 1.17 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase in the yield was primarily due to an increase in the yield on loans to 6.09 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.74 for the same period in 2023. In addition, the Company s lower yielding securities continue to mature with proceeds being reinvested in higher yielding loans or federal funds sold. When compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the average balance of the Company s securities decreased 59.0 million, while the Company s average loans and federal funds sold balances increased 40.6 million and 58.0 million, respectively, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Total interest expense increased 1.5 million when comparing the periods due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 1.30 for the third quarter of 2023 to 1.87 for the third quarter of 2024, in addition to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities from 813.2 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 875.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The Company had no outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.3 million with an average rate of 6.03 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company had average outstanding borrowings under the Federal Reserve Bank s Bank Term Funding Plan BTFP of 33.6 million and 13.0 million with an average rate of 4.89 and 5.02 during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As a result of the changes in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the net interest margin increased from 3.02 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 3.12 for the same period in 2024. 

Provision for credit losses . Based on management s analysis of the ACL on loans and unfunded loan commitments, the provision for credit losses increased from 290,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 463,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to loan growth during the period, the increase in nonperforming assets during the quarter, as well as management s consideration of macroeconomic uncertainty. The Bank recognized net charge-offs of 64,000 and 19,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Noninterest income. Noninterest income decreased 147,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The Company recognized a 196,000 loss on equity securities for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 131,000 for the same quarter in 2023. The Company did not sell any securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized a net 63,000 gain on sale of securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold securities available for sale with a market value of 9.4 million and an amortized cost basis of 9.5 million resulting in a net loss of 94,000. The net loss was more than offset by the 157,000 gain on sale of the Company s VISA Class B stock in September 2023. In addition, other income decreased 54,000 during the quarter. These were partially offset by increases of 17,000 and 13,000 in ATM and debit card fees and service charges on deposit accounts, respectively.

 FIRST CAPITAL, INC. 

Noninterest expense. Noninterest expense increased 543,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to increases in professional fees and compensation and benefits of 213,000 and 160,000, respectively. The increase in professional fees is primarily due to increased costs associated with the Company s annual audit and fees being accrued for the Company s ongoing core contract negotiations. The increase in compensation and benefits is due to standard increases in salary and wages as well as increases in the cost of Company-provided health insurance benefits. In addition, data processing, advertising, and occupancy and equipment expenses increased 51,000, 45,000, and 41,000, respectively. 

Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased 35,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the Company s taxable income. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 15.6 compared to 15.4 for the same period in 2023. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net income. Net income attributable to the Company was 8.7 million 2.59 per diluted share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.7 million 2.89 per diluted share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net interest income. Net interest income after provision for credit losses increased 72,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Total interest income increased 5.3 million when comparing the two periods due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets from 3.80 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.37 for the same period in 2024. The increase in the yield was primarily due to an increase in the yield on loans to 5.99 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 5.57 for the same period in 2023. In addition, the Company s lower yielding securities continue to mature with proceeds being reinvested in higher yielding loans or federal funds sold. When compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the average balance of the Company s securities decreased 49.7 million, while the Company s average loans and federal funds sold balances increased 50.8 million and 15.5 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Total interest expense increased 5.0 million as the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.72 for the same period in 2024, in addition to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities from 805.1 million for the first nine months of 2023 to 846.8 million for the same period of 2024. The Company had average outstanding advances from the FHLB of 2.3 million and 2.6 million with an average rate of 5.69 and 5.49 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had average outstanding borrowings under the Federal Reserve Bank s BTFP of 33.1 million and 6.4 million with an average rate of 4.84 and 5.03 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As a result of the changes in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the net interest margin decreased from 3.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.09 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Provision for credit losses . Based on management s analysis of the ACL on loans and unfunded loan commitments, the provision for credit losses increased from 833,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to loan growth during the period, the increase in the nonperforming assets, as well as management s consideration of macroeconomic uncertainty. The Bank recognized net charge-offs of 149,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 380,000 for the same period in 2023. 

Noninterest income. Noninterest income decreased 79,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the Company recognizing a 270,000 loss on equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an 86,000 loss during the same period in 2023. This was partially offset by increases of 77,000 and 30,000 from gains on sale of loans and service charges on deposit accounts, respectively. 

Noninterest expense. Noninterest expense increased 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This was primarily due to increases in professional fees, compensation and benefits, data processing, and other expenses of 424,000, 374,000, 130,000, and 179,000, respectively, when comparing the two periods. The increase in professional fees is primarily due to increased costs associated with the Company s annual audit and fees being accrued for the Company s ongoing core contract negotiations. The increase in compensation and benefits is due to standard increases in salary and wages as well as increases in the cost of Company-provided health insurance benefits. The increase in data processing expense is primarily due to increased debit card interchange fees. Increases in other expenses included a 77,000 increase in the Company s support of local communities through sponsorships and donations, 26,000 in increased dues and subscriptions and 24,000 of additional FDIC insurance assessments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 

Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased 238,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 resulting in an effective tax rate of 15.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.4 for the same period in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Bank s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from loan repayments, maturing securities and borrowings from the FHLB or FRB. While loan repayments and maturities are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had cash and cash equivalents of 89.9 million and securities available-for-sale with a fair value of 408.5 million. If the Bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB, FRB, collateral eligible for repurchase agreements and unsecured federal funds purchased lines of credit with other financial institutions. 

The Bank s primary investing activity is the origination of one-to-four family mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, consumer, multi-family, commercial business and residential construction loans. The Bank also invests in U.S. Government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies. 

The Bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND 

 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 FIRST CAPITAL, INC. 

The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company, on a stand-alone basis, is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Company also has authorized the repurchase of shares of its common stock. The Company s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions IDFI ), cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined under Indiana law) for the preceding two calendar years. On a stand-alone basis, the Company had liquid assets of 2.8 million at September 30, 2024. 

The Bank is required to maintain specific amounts of capital pursuant to regulatory requirements. Beginning in 2020, qualifying community banks with assets of less than 10 billion are eligible to opt in to the Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR framework. The CBLR is the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies must set the minimum capital for the new CBLR at not less than 8 and not more than 10 , and has set the minimum ratio at 9 effective January 1, 2022. A financial institution that falls below the minimum CBLR generally has a two quarter grace period to get back into compliance as long as it maintains a minimum CBLR of 8 . A financial institution can elect to be subject to or opt out of the CBLR framework at any time. As a qualified community bank, the Bank had opted into the CBLR framework as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and its CBLR was 10.24 and 9.92 as of those dates, respectively. Management believes that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject as of September 30, 2024. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded on the Company s financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are primarily used to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and letters of credit. A further presentation of the Company s off-balance sheet arrangements is presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023 which requires an ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. See Note 4 for additional information. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES 

 ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 FIRST CAPITAL, INC. 

Qualitative Aspects of Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that the Company s net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes. 

The Company s principal financial objective is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates. The Company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Company has developed strategies to manage its liquidity, shorten its effective maturities of certain interest-earning assets and decrease the interest rate sensitivity of its asset base. Management has sought to decrease the average maturity of its assets by emphasizing the origination of short-term commercial and consumer loans, all of which are retained by the Company for its portfolio. The Company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds. Management believes retail deposits, compared to brokered deposits, reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds. 

Quantitative Aspects of Market Risk. The Company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does the Company engage in hedging activities or purchase high-risk derivative instruments. Furthermore, the Company is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk. 

Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits, extending loans and investing in investment securities. Many factors affect the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. The Company s earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 

An element in the Company s ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a Net Interest Income at Risk simulation to model the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet and to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the Company. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over a one-year horizon. The model assumes a semi-static balance sheet and measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical changes in interest rates over twelve months and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements. The scenarios include prepayment assumptions, changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and spreads between market interest rates in order to capture the impact from re-pricing, yield curve, option, and basis risks.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s simulated exposure to an increase in interest rates shows that an immediate and sustained increase, or decrease, in rates of 1.00 , would increase the Company s net interest income over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario. At September 30, 2024, an immediate and sustained increase in rates of 2.00 or 3.00 would decrease the Company s net interest income over a one year horizon compared to a flat rates scenario. At December 31, 2023, an immediate and sustained increase in rates of 2.00 or 3.00 would increase the Company s net interest income over a one year horizon compared to a flat rates scenario. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an immediate and sustained decrease in rates of 2.00 or 3.00 would decrease the Company s net interest income over a one year horizon compared to a flat rates scenario. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management evaluated and adjusted deposit rate betas, interest rate spreads and rate index ties in its scenarios to better reflect the current interest rate environment and increased competitive pressure for deposits. 

The Company also has longer term interest rate risk exposure, which may not be appropriately measured by Net Interest Income at Risk modeling. Therefore, the Company also uses an Economic Value of Equity EVE interest rate sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the impact of its interest rate risk on earnings and capital. This is measured by computing the changes in net EVE for its cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. EVE modeling involves discounting present values of all cash flows for on and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents the Company s EVE and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. The amount of base case EVE and its sensitivity to shifts in interest rates provide a measure of the longer term re-pricing and option risk in the balance sheet.

The tables indicate that at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company would expect a decrease in its EVE in the event of a sudden and sustained 200 or 300 basis point increase or a 100, 200 or 300 sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing interest rates. At September 30, 2024, the Company would expect a decrease in its EVE in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 basis point increase in prevailing interest rates. At December 31, 2023, the Company would expect an increase in its EVE in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 basis point increase in prevailing interest rates. As previously mentioned in this report, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management evaluated and adjusted deposit rate betas, interest rate spreads and rate index ties in its scenarios to better reflect the current interest rate environment and increased competitive pressure for deposits.

PART I ITEM 3 

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES 

 ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 FIRST CAPITAL, INC. 

The models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect the Company s net interest income and EVE. For this reason, the Company models many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes. Therefore, as with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables and it is recognized that the model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates of deposit could deviate significantly from those assumed in the modeling scenarios. 

PART I - ITEM 4 

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 FIRST CAPITAL, INC. 

Controls and Procedures 

The Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the SEC (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
