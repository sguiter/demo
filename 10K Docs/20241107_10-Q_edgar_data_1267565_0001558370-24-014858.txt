In addition, there were sales of marketable securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net unrealized holding gains or losses for the period that have been included in accumulated other comprehensive loss were not material to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company did not record any allowances for credit losses to adjust the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reviews its investments for other-than-temporary impairment whenever the fair value of an investment is less than amortized cost and evidence indicates that an investment s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time. To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. The Company generally does not intend to sell any investments prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis for any investment in an unrealized loss position. As such, the Company did not hold any securities with other-than-temporary impairment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 before the FDA could issue a final approval for Xtampza ER, unless the stay was earlier terminated. The Delaware court transferred the case to the District of Massachusetts. After the Company filed a partial motion for judgment on the pleadings relating to the Orange Book-listed patents, the District Court of Massachusetts ordered judgment in the Company s favor on those patents, and dismissed the claims which lifted the 30-month stay of FDA approval. Following this judgment, the Company obtained final approval for Xtampza ER and launched commercially. Purdue subsequently filed follow-on lawsuits asserting infringement of patents that had been late-listed in the Orange Book and, therefore, could not trigger any stay of FDA approval: Purdue asserted infringement of Patent No. 9,073,933 in November 2015 and Patent No. 9,522,919 in April 2017. In addition, Purdue invoked two non-Orange Book-listed patents, filing suit in June 2016 asserting infringement of Patent No. 9,155,717 and in September 2017, asserting infringement of Patent No. 9,693,961. On March 13, 2018, the Company filed a Petition for Post-Grant Review PGR of the 961 patent with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB ). The PGR argued that the 961 patent is invalid. On November 21, 2017, the Court issued its claim construction ruling, construing certain claims of the 933, 497, and 717 patents. The Court issued an order on September 28, 2018, in which it ruled that the Xtampza ER formulation does not infringe the 497 and 717 patents. On September 15, 2019, Purdue commenced chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Later in September 2019, Purdue gave the District Court of Massachusetts, as well as the PTAB, notice of its bankruptcy filing and sought the imposition of an automatic stay of proceedings. Both the Court and the PTAB granted Purdue s requests to stay the pending matters. On September 1, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order, lifting the automatic stays in both the District of Massachusetts and PTAB proceedings. On September 11, 2020, Purdue filed a motion to terminate the PTAB action on the basis that those proceedings had gone beyond the -month statutory period. On November 19, 2021, the PTAB: (i) denied Purdue s motion to terminate the PGR; and (ii) issued its Final Written Decision, finding that the asserted claims of the 961 patent were invalid for lack of written description and anticipation. Purdue appealed the decision to the Federal Circuit, which issued its decision on November 21, 2023, affirming the authority of the PTAB to issue its Final Written Decision and upholding the PTAB s finding of invalidity relative to the 961 patent. Purdue has exhausted all possibility of appeal, and the judgment of invalidity of the 961 patent is final without further right of appeal. On April 2, 2021, the Court granted Purdue s Motion to Lift the Stay in the District of Massachusetts that was entered following Purdue s Notice of Bankruptcy. On April 9, 2021, Purdue filed another follow-on lawsuit asserting infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,407,434. The Company responded to Purdue s complaint with a motion to dismiss. On May 21, 2021, and in response to the Company s motion to dismiss, Purdue filed an amended complaint. The Company renewed its motion to dismiss on June 4, 2021, arguing: (i) Purdue cannot, as a matter of law, state a claim for infringement under 271(e)(2)(A); (ii) Purdue cannot, as a matter of law, state a claim for product-by-process infringement under 271(g); and (iii) Purdue has not alleged facts sufficient to support any indirect infringement theory under 271(b) or (c). The Court held a hearing on the Company s motion to dismiss on October 13, 2021, and the motion is pending before the Court. Like the prior follow-on lawsuits, the 434 patent litigation was consolidated into the lead case and a scheduling order was entered. On May 15, 2023, the Court issued an order that: (i) vacated the existing deadlines with respect to the 933, 919, and 434 patents and stayed the case pending the Federal Circuit s decision in a different litigation that invalidated certain claims of the 933 and 919 patents; and (ii) continued the existing stay concerning the 961 patent pending resolution of Purdue s appeal rights relating to the decision invalidating the claims of the 961 patent. The Court has not set a deadline for dispositive motions or trial. The remaining patents-in-suit in the lead consolidated action in the District of Massachusetts are the 933, 919, 434, and 961 patents. Purdue has made a demand for monetary relief, and requested a judgment of infringement, an

Outside of the MDL, several cases were filed against the Company in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts state courts with allegations similar to those in the MDL related to opioid marketing and distribution practices, as well as allegations including violations of state consumer protections laws. On March 21, 2019, the Arkansas state court litigation was dismissed. On December 24, 2021, the Company entered into a settlement framework with Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law, LLP, the law firm representing plaintiffs in jurisdictions filed either in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts state courts, or filed in other state courts and removed to the MDL. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the Company paid in exchange for dismissal, with prejudice, of each plaintiff s lawsuit and a release of claims related to such lawsuits. The Company is currently dismissed from all cases. The Company settled to efficiently resolve these litigations and did not admit any liability or acknowledge any wrongdoing in connection with the settlement.

The Merger Litigations assert violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against BDSI s Board of Directors. The Merger Litigations seek, among other things: an injunction enjoining consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger Agreement, a declaration that BDSI and its Board of Directors violated Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, damages, costs of the action, including plaintiffs attorneys fees and experts fees and expenses, and any other relief the court may deem just and proper. In addition, between February and March of 2022, BDSI received demand letters from purported stockholders of BDSI seeking to inspect certain books and records of BDSI related to the Merger (collectively, the Inspection Letters ). In March 2022, BDSI received demand letters from purported stockholders alleging that the Schedule 14D-9 omits purportedly material information relating to the Merger (collectively, the Demand Letters ). Plaintiffs in the Higley, Zomber, and Justice Actions each filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of their complaint in the second quarter of 2022. On July 28, 2022, plaintiff in the Sanford Action filed a partial voluntary dismissal of the individual named defendants, and on October 26, 2022, filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the BDSI defendant. On February 17, 2023, the Stein Action was dismissed. While the Company believes that the remaining Merger Litigations, Inspection Letters, and Demand Letters are without merit and that the disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 comply fully with applicable law, solely in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation, BDSI previously determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with certain supplemental disclosures set forth in BDSI s Schedule 14D-9 filed with the SEC on March 11, 2022 (the Supplemental Disclosures ). The Company and BDSI believe that the Supplemental Disclosures mooted all allegations or concerns raised in the Merger Litigations, Inspection Letters, and Demand Letters.

 Effective tax rate The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the estimated annual effective tax rate as adjusted for the discrete nondeductible costs. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflect the estimated annual effective tax rate was additionally impacted by non-deductible costs from the debt extinguishment that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2024, partially offset by discrete excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by discrete nondeductible costs associated with the debt extinguishment that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2023, partially offset by discrete excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. The Company provides a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the extent to which a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is required, the Company evaluates all available evidence including projections of future taxable income, carry back opportunities, reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities, and other tax planning strategies. The Company has maintained a valuation allowance on the portion of its deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized due to tax limitation or other conditions as of September 30, 2024. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including those set forth under Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors, as revised and supplemented by those risks described from time to time in other reports which we file with the SEC.

 Overview We are building a leading, diversified specialty pharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people living with serious medical conditions. We commercialize our product portfolio, consisting of Belbuca, Xtampza ER, Nucynta IR and Nucynta ER (collectively the Nucynta Products ), Symproic, and Jornay PM Jornay in the United States. Belbuca is a buccal film that contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III opioid, and was approved by the FDA in October 2015 for severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative options are inadequate. We began shipping and recognizing product sales related to Belbuca in March 2022 following our acquisition of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. BDSI ). Xtampza ER, an abuse-deterrent, oral formulation of oxycodone, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA in April 2016 for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. We commercially launched Xtampza ER in June 2016. The Nucynta Products are immediate-release IR and extended-release ER formulations of tapentadol. Nucynta IR is indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg. Nucynta ER is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. We began shipping and recognizing product sales on the Nucynta Products in January 2018 and began marketing the Nucynta Products in February 2018. In August 2023, the FDA granted New Patient Population exclusivity in pediatrics for Nucynta IR. This grant extended the period of U.S. exclusivity for Nucynta IR from June 27, 2025 to July 3, 2026. In June 2024, the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity to the Nucynta Products for an additional six months, to January 3, 2027 for Nucynta IR and December 27, 2025 for Nucynta ER. Symproic was approved by the FDA in March 2017 for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation OIC in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent (e.g., weekly) opioid dosage escalation. We began shipping and recognizing product sales related to Symproic in March 2022 following our acquisition of BDSI. Jornay is a central nervous system CNS stimulant prescription medicine that contains methylphenidate HCl, which was approved by the FDA in August 2018 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD in people six years of age and older and currently the only FDA-approved stimulant medication that is dosed in the evening. We began recognizing product sales related to Jornay in September 2024 following our acquisition of Ironshore Therapeutics Inc. Ironshore (the Ironshore Acquisition ). Outlook We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with expected cash inflows from the commercialization of our products, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service and capital expenditure requirements under our current business plan for the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used, which would have resulted in different financial results. For a description of critical accounting policies that affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, refer to our Annual Report. Changes in our critical accounting policies with respect to our Annual Report include business combination accounting and valuation of acquired assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, as described below.

Table of Contents 
 Business Combination Accounting and Valuation of Acquired Net Assets We completed the Ironshore Acquisition on September 3, 2024, which was accounted for as a business combination. To determine whether the acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we made certain judgments regarding whether the acquired set of activities and assets met the definition of a business. Judgment is required in assessing whether the acquired processes or activities, along with their inputs, would be substantive to constitute a business, as defined by U.S. GAAP. The acquisition method of accounting requires that we recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the acquisition date net fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation is a critical accounting estimate because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions based on non-observable inputs. An income approach, which generally relies upon projected cash flow models, is used in estimating the fair value of the acquired intangible assets, the fair value of acquired inventory and the fair value of the assumed deferred royalty obligation. These cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of economic and market conditions including the estimated future cash flows from revenues of acquired assets; the timing and projection of costs and expenses, discount rates; and tax rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which occurs before finalization of the purchase price allocation, changes in assumptions and estimates that result in adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if based on facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date, are recorded on a retroactive basis as of the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to Goodwill. Any adjustments not based on facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date, or if subsequent to the conclusion of the measurement period, will be recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.

 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Product revenues, net Product revenues, net were 159.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Quarter ), compared to 136.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Quarter ). The 22.6 million increase is primarily due to increased revenue for Xtampza of 9.7 million, Belbuca of 7.7 million, and Jornay of 8.0 million, partially offset by decreased revenue for the Nucynta Products of 2.4 million. The increase in revenue for Xtampza ER of 9.7 million is primarily due to lower gross-to-net adjustments related to provisions for rebates and returns as well as higher gross price, partially offset by lower sales volume. The increase in revenue for Jornay of 8.0 million is due to the acquisition of the product from Ironshore in the 2024 Quarter. The increase in revenue for Belbuca of 7.7 million is primarily due to higher sales volume and gross price, partially offset by higher gross-to-net adjustments related to provisions for chargebacks. The decrease in revenue for the Nucynta Products of 2.4 million is primarily due to lower sales volume and higher gross-to-net adjustments related to provisions for rebates, partially offset by higher gross price. Cost of product revenues Cost of product revenues (excluding intangible asset amortization) was 21.7 million for the 2024 Quarter, compared to 20.1 million for the 2023 Quarter. The 1.6 million increase was due to the addition of Jornay as a result of the Ironshore Acquisition in the 2024 Quarter. Intangible asset amortization expense is recognized in connection with our intangible assets. The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives. Intangible asset amortization was 40.8 million for the 2024 Quarter, compared to 36.3 million for the 2023 Quarter. The 4.5 million increase was primarily due to the addition of the Jornay intangible asset during the 2024 Quarter, partially offset by a decrease as a result of the FDA granting New Patient Population exclusivity for Nucynta IR through July 3, 2026 in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in an extension of the estimated useful life of the underlying intangible asset and a reduction of amortization expense recognized during the 2024 Quarter. Operating Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were 62.0 million for the 2024 Quarter, compared to 35.3 million for the 2023 Quarter. The 26.7 million increase was primarily related to: an increase in acquisition-related expense of 19.9 million due to the Ironshore Acquisition; an increase in salaries, wages and benefits of 4.0 million primarily due to additional headcount added in the 2024 Quarter as a result of the Ironshore Acquisition, including the sales force that promotes Jornay; and an increase in sales and marketing expenses of 3.0 million, primarily due to the timing of marketing related expenses as well as additional sales and marketing expenses to support Jornay. Interest expense and Interest income Interest expense was 18.4 million for the 2024 Quarter, compared to 20.8 million for the 2023 Quarter. The 2.4 million decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense associated with the 2022 Term Loan and 2024 Term Loan as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by additional interest costs from borrowings to partially finance the acquisition of Ironshore. Interest income was 3.3 million for the 2024 Quarter, compared to 4.5 million for the 2023 Quarter. The 1.2 million decrease was primarily due to a lower overall balance invested in the 2024 Quarter compared to the 2023 Quarter as a result of cash being used to fund the Ironshore Acquisition in the 2024 Quarter.

 Loss on extinguishment of debt Loss on extinguishment of debt was 4.1 million for the 2024 Quarter, compared to none in the 2023 Quarter. The 4.1 million increase was due to the redemption and extinguishment of assumed debt from the Ironshore Acquisition during the 2024 Quarter. Taxes The provision for income taxes was 6.2 million for the 2024 Quarter, compared to 8.1 million for the 2023 Quarter. The 1.9 million decrease is primarily due to lower earnings in the 2024 Quarter compared to the 2023 Quarter primarily due to acquisition related-expense incurred during the 2024 Quarter due to the Ironshore Acquisition. Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Product revenues, net Product revenues, net were 449.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Period ), compared to 417.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Period ). The 32.5 million increase is primarily due to increased revenue for Belbuca of 23.3 million, Xtampza of 11.0 million and Jornay of 8.0 million, partially offset by decreased revenue for the Nucynta Products of 9.1 million. The increase in revenue for Belbuca of 23.3 million is primarily due to higher sales volume and gross price, partially offset by higher gross-to-net adjustments related to provisions for chargebacks. The increase in revenue for Xtampza ER of 11.0 million is primarily due to lower gross-to-net adjustments related to provisions for rebates and higher gross price, partially offset by lower sales volume. The increase in revenue for Jornay of 8.0 million is due to the acquisition of the product from Ironshore in the 2024 Quarter. The decrease in revenue for the Nucynta Products of 9.1 million is primarily due to lower sales volume and higher gross-to-net adjustments related to provisions for rebates, partially offset by higher gross price. Cost of product revenues Cost of product revenues (excluding intangible asset amortization) was 60.6 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 74.2 million for the 2023 Period. The 13.6 million decrease was primarily related to the 2023 Period including higher cost of product revenues related to the step-up basis in inventory acquired from BDSI, partially offset by cost of product revenues for Jornay as well as higher sales volume in the 2024 Period for Belbuca. Intangible asset amortization was 109.8 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 111.2 million for the 2023 Period. The 1.4 million decrease was primarily a result of the FDA granting New Patient Population exclusivity for Nucynta IR to July 3, 2026 in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in an extension of the estimated useful life of the underlying intangible asset and a reduction of amortization expense recognized during the 2024 Period. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in intangible asset amortization following the Ironshore Acquisition in the 2024 Period. Operating Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were 147.3 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 126.3 million for the 2023 Period. The 21.0 million increase was primarily related to: an increase in acquisition related expense of 19.9 million due to the Ironshore Acquisition; and an increase in salaries, wages and benefits of 10.9 million primarily due to expenses incurred as a result of the CEO transition announced in May 2024, including higher stock-based compensation expense of 3.7 million related to accelerated equity awards and higher severance, benefits, and related expenses incurred of 3.1 million, as well as an increase of 4.1 million in other salaries, wages and benefits expense, including the

 impact of the additional headcount added in the 2024 Quarter as a result of the Ironshore Acquisition, including the sales force for Jornay; partially offset by a decrease in audit and legal expenses of 9.9 million, primarily due to an 8.5 million litigation settlement during the 2023 Period and lower litigation related expenses. Interest expense and Interest income Interest expense was 51.3 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 64.1 million for the 2023 Period. The 12.8 million decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense associated with the 2022 Term Loan and 2024 Term Loan as a result of a lower average overall principal balance during the 2024 Period, partially offset by additional interest costs from borrowings on September 3, 2024 to partially finance the acquisition of Ironshore. Interest income was 12.2 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 11.3 million for the 2023 Period. The 0.9 million increase was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as a higher overall average balance invested in the 2024 Period compared to the 2023 Period. Loss on extinguishment of debt Loss on extinguishment of debt was 11.3 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 23.5 million in the 2023 Period. The 12.2 million decrease was due to the 2023 Period including a 23.5 million loss on extinguishment resulting from the repurchase of 117.4 million of convertible notes due in 2026 in the 2023 Period. In the 2024 Period, the remaining 26.4 million of convertible notes due in 2026 were redeemed, resulting in a 7.2 million loss on extinguishment in the 2024 Period. In addition, in the 2024 Period, assumed debt from the Ironshore Acquisition was redeemed, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of 4.1 million in the 2024 Period. Taxes The provision for income taxes was 24.6 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 12.8 million for the 2023 Period. The 11.8 million increase is primarily due to higher earnings in the 2024 Period compared to the 2023 Period. These increases were partially offset by the 2023 Period including higher non-deductible costs associated with debt extinguishments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity Historically, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements and/or public offerings of our preferred stock, common stock, and convertible notes; term loan debt; and cash inflows from sales of our products. We are primarily dependent on the commercial success of Belbuca, Xtampza, the Nucynta Products, and Jornay. In July 2024, we amended and replaced our 2022 Term Loan with a 645.8 million secured term loan (the 2024 Term Loan ), consisting of a 320.8 million initial term loan and a 325.0 million delayed draw term loan. We used the proceeds of the initial term loan to refinance in full all outstanding indebtedness under the 2022 Term Loan. We used the proceeds of the delayed draw term loan to fund a portion of the consideration to complete the Ironshore Acquisition and, pay fees and expenses in connection with the Ironshore Acquisition and the 2024 Term Loan. We will use the remainder for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the 2029 Convertible Notes was 241.5 million. The 241.5 million principal balance is due in 2029. As of September 30, 2024, we had 120.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, together with expected cash inflows from operations, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service, and capital expenditure requirements under our current business plan for the foreseeable future.

 Borrowing Arrangements The following transactions represent material changes in our borrowing arrangements from our most recently filed Annual Report. On April 11, 2024, we provided notice of redemption for the remaining 26.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.625 convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the 2026 Convertible Notes ). The 2026 Convertible Notes were fully redeemed on June 18, 2024. We settled the redemption of the 2026 Convertible Notes in cash. Refer to Note 12, Convertible Senior Notes, for more information. On July 28, 2024, in connection with the acquisition of Ironshore Therapeutics Inc., we amended and restated the 2022 Term Loan. Refer to Note 11, Term Note Payable , for more information. Cash Flows 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 120,336 201,411 Net cash used in investing activities (275,997) (45,715) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (19,326) (72,352) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (174,987) 83,344 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was 120.3 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 201.4 million for the 2023 Period. The 81.1 million decrease was primarily due to cash used to settle certain liabilities assumed from Ironshore, including 28.4 million of Ironshore s cash-settled share-based awards liabilities, 23.5 million of accrued operating liabilities, and 9.0 million of Ironshore cash-settled warrant liabilities. In addition, various acquisition-related expenses were incurred and paid in the 2024 Period, including 7.6 million in transaction costs, 6.7 million in employee-related expenses, and 1.1 million in Ironshore directors and officers insurance expense in the 2024 Period related to the Ironshore Acquisition. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was 276.0 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 45.7 million for the 2023 Period. The 230.3 million increase was primarily due to 267.5 million cash paid to acquire Ironshore (net of cash acquired) and 32.6 million increase in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by 70.6 million increase in maturities of marketable securities. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was 19.3 million for the 2024 Period, compared to 72.4 million in the 2023 Period. The 53.1 million decrease was primarily due to: an increase in proceeds received from the modification of term loans of 313.2 million; a decrease in repayments of term notes of 25.0 million; a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock of 15.0 million; an increase in cash provided from stock option exercises of 4.7 million; partially offset by the payoff of assumed debt from Ironshore of 164.6 million in the 2024 Period; the repurchase of a portion of our 2026 Convertible Notes and issuance of our 2029 Convertible Notes which resulted in net proceeds of 96.6 million in the 2023 Period; the 33.2 million cash settlement of our 2026 Convertible Notes in the 2024 Period; and an increase in payments for employee stock tax withholdings of 10.8 million. Funding Requirements We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, together with expected cash inflows from operations, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service, and capital expenditure requirements under our current business plan for the foreseeable future. However, we are subject to all the risks common to the commercialization and development of new pharmaceutical products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.

Table of Contents 
 We have significant future capital requirements, including: expected operating expenses to manufacture and commercialize our products and to operate our organization; repayment of outstanding principal amounts and interest in connection with our 2024 Term Loan and 2029 Convertible Notes; royalties we pay on sales of certain products within our portfolio; the successful integration of Ironshore operations following the Ironshore Acquisition; operating lease obligations; minimum purchase obligations in connection with our contract manufacturer; cash paid for income taxes; deferred royalty obligation in connection with Jornay, and contingent payment upon the achievement of a financial milestone based on net revenues of Jornay. In addition, we have significant potential future capital requirements, including: we may enter into business development transactions, including acquisitions, collaborations, licensing arrangements and equity investments, that require additional capital; any judgments rendered against us in connection with any of the litigation matters set forth in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies , to our financial statements; and in January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 150.0 million of shares of our common stock through June 30, 2025. Future share repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, our results of operations and financial conditions, the price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and other factors that we may deem relevant. Additional Information To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we have included information about certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide analysts, investors, lenders, and other third parties with insights into how we evaluate normal operational activities, including our ability to generate cash from operations, on a comparable year-over-year basis and manage our budgeting and forecasting. In addition, certain non-GAAP financial measures, primarily adjusted EBITDA, are used to measure performance when determining components of annual compensation for substantially all non-sales force employees, including senior management. We may discuss the following financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP in our quarterly and annual reports, earnings press releases and conference calls. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA, as used by us, may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. There are several limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income or loss, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent, such as: adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, the cash requirements for which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the benefit from or provision for income taxes or the cash requirements to pay taxes; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 we exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA although: (i) it has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and (ii) if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position; we exclude impairment expenses from adjusted EBITDA and, although these are non-cash expenses, the asset(s) being impaired may have to be replaced in the future, the cash requirements for which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA; we exclude restructuring expenses from adjusted EBITDA. Restructuring expenses primarily include employee severance and contract termination costs that are not related to acquisitions. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring expenses are not part of our underlying business; we exclude litigation settlements from adjusted EBITDA, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred; we exclude acquisition related expenses as the amount and/or frequency of these expenses are not part of our underlying business. Acquisition related expenses include transaction costs, which primarily consisted of financial advisory, banking, legal, and regulatory fees, and other consulting fees, incurred to complete the acquisition, employee-related expenses (severance cost and benefits) for terminated employees after the acquisition, and miscellaneous other acquisition related expenses incurred; we exclude recognition of the step-up basis in inventory from acquisitions (i.e., the adjustment to record inventory from historic cost to fair value at acquisition) as the adjustment does not reflect the ongoing expense associated with sale of our products as part of our underlying business; we exclude losses on extinguishments of debt as these expenses are episodic in nature and do not directly correlate to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis; and we exclude other expenses, from time to time, that are episodic in nature and do not directly correlate to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) GAAP net income 9,335 20,634 56,654 16,215 Adjustments: Interest expense 18,394 20,768 51,320 64,058 Interest income (3,280) (4,538) (12,164) (11,312) Loss on extinguishment of debt 4,145 11,329 23,504 Provision for income taxes 6,245 8,149 24,645 12,808 Depreciation 946 835 2,815 2,547 Amortization 40,801 36,317 109,833 111,246 Stock-based compensation 7,317 7,027 24,804 20,134 Litigation settlements 8,500 Recognition of step-up basis in inventory 1,301 198 1,301 15,116 CEO transition expense 3,051 Acquisition related expenses 19,886 19,886 Total adjustments 95,755 68,756 236,820 246,601 Adjusted EBITDA 105,090 89,390 293,474 262,816 Adjusted EBITDA was 105.1 million for the 2024 Quarter compared to 89.4 million for the 2023 Quarter. The 15.7 million increase was primarily due to higher product revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was 293.5 million for the 2024 Period compared to 262.8 million for the 2023 Period. The 30.7 million increase was primarily due to higher product revenues.

 Adjusted Operating Expenses Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations. Adjusted operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) GAAP operating expenses 61,955 35,298 147,272 126,266 Adjustments: Stock-based compensation 7,317 7,027 24,804 20,134 Litigation settlements 8,500 CEO transition expense 3,051 Acquisition related expenses 19,886 19,886 Total adjustments 27,203 7,027 47,741 28,634 Adjusted operating expenses 34,752 28,271 99,531 97,632 Adjusted operating expenses were 34.8 million in the 2024 Quarter compared to 28.3 million in the 2023 Quarter. The 6.5 million was primarily driven by: higher salaries, wages and benefits (excluding stock-based compensation expense) of 3.8 million due to additional headcount added in the 2024 Quarter as a result of the Ironshore Acquisition, including the sales force for Jornay; and higher sales and marketing expenses of 3.0 million, primarily due to the timing of marketing related expenses as well as additional sales and marketing expenses to support Jornay following in the Ironshore Acquisition. Adjusted operating expenses were 99.5 million in the 2024 Period compared to 97.6 million in the 2023 Period. The 1.9 million increase was primarily driven by: higher salaries, wages and benefits (excluding stock-based compensation expense) of 3.8 million due to additional headcount added in the 2024 Quarter as a result of the Ironshore Acquisition, including the sales force for Jornay; partially offset by lower audit and legal expenses (excluding litigation settlements) of 1.4 million. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude significant income and expense items that are non-cash or not indicative of ongoing operations, including consideration of the tax effect of the adjustments. Adjusted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents adjusted net income per share. Adjusted weighted-average shares - diluted is calculated in accordance with the treasury stock, if-converted, or contingently issuable accounting methods, depending on the nature of the security.

 Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except share and per share data) GAAP net income 9,335 20,634 56,654 16,215 Adjustments: Non-cash interest expense 1,681 2,124 5,065 6,672 Loss on extinguishment of debt 4,145 11,329 23,504 Amortization 40,801 36,317 109,833 111,246 Stock-based compensation 7,317 7,027 24,804 20,134 Litigation settlements 8,500 Recognition of step-up basis in inventory 1,301 198 1,301 15,116 CEO transition expense 3,051 Acquisition related expenses 19,886 19,886 Income tax effect of above adjustments (1) (20,974) (11,300) (45,635) (42,274) Total adjustments 54,157 34,366 129,634 142,898 Non-GAAP adjusted net income 63,492 55,000 186,288 159,113 Adjusted weighted-average shares diluted (2) 40,163,266 42,058,820 40,400,483 41,679,546 Adjusted earnings per share (2) 1.61 1.34 4.71 3.91 (1) The income tax effect of the adjustments was calculated by applying our blended federal and state statutory rate to the items that have a tax effect. The blended federal and state statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 28.1 and 25.6 , respectively; and the blended federal and state statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 27.1 and 25.6 , respectively. As such, the non-GAAP effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 27.9 and 24.7 , respectively; and the non-GAAP effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 26.0 and 22.8 , respectively. (2) Adjusted weighted-average shares - diluted were calculated using the if-converted method for our convertible notes in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . As such, adjusted weighted-average shares diluted includes shares related to the assumed conversion of our convertible notes and the associated cash interest expense added-back to non-GAAP adjusted net income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjusted weighted-average shares diluted includes 6,606,305 and 7,509,104 shares, respectively, attributable to our convertible notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjusted weighted-average shares diluted includes 6,606,305 and 6,530,392 shares, respectively, attributable to our convertible notes. In addition, adjusted earnings per share includes other potentially dilutive securities to the extent that they are not antidilutive. Contractual Obligations With the exception of the 2024 Term Loan as discussed in Note 11, Term Notes Payable , and deferred royalty obligation as discussed in Note 13, Deferred Royalty Obligation , there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations and commitments described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations from our most recently filed Annual Report. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity in connection with our investment portfolio and the 2024 Term Loan. None of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes.

 Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio includes financial instruments that are sensitive to interest rate risks. Our investment portfolio is used to preserve capital, maintain liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements, and maximize returns commensurate with our risk appetite. We invest in instruments that meet the credit quality, diversification, liquidity, and maturity standards outlined in our investment policy. As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio includes 13.0 million of cash equivalents and 81.0 million of marketable securities, which are primarily comprised of money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, government-sponsored securities, and commercial paper. Our money market funds are short-term highly liquid investments, and our marketable securities have active secondary or resale markets to help ensure liquidity. We account for marketable securities as available-for-sale, thus, no gains or losses are realized due to changes in the fair value of our marketable securities unless we sell our investments prior to maturity or incur a credit loss. Furthermore, our investment policy includes guidelines limiting the term-to-maturity of our investments. Due to the nature of our investments, we do not believe that the fair value of our investments has a material exposure to interest rate risk. 2024 Term Loan The 2024 Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to adjusted term SOFR + 4.50 , and is subject to quarterly amortization payments equal to 2.50 of the original funded amount of the 2024 Term Loan. Based on the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Term Loan as of November 7, 2024 of 645.8 million and the applicable interest rate, a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease future interest expense by approximately 6.5 million. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. As permitted by SEC guidance, which provides that a newly acquired company may be excluded from management s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures for up to a year from the date of acquisition, Ironshore was excluded from the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Ironshore, which we acquired in September 2024, represented approximately 8 of the Company s total consolidated assets (excluding goodwill, intangibles, and the recognition of step-up basis in inventory) and 2 of our consolidated total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We are currently in the process of evaluating and integrating the acquired operations, processes, and internal controls of Ironshore. Except for the acquisition of Ironshore, which we expect to integrate into our existing internal control environment, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to our financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent applicable, there are no other material changes from the legal proceedings previously disclosed in our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ). Item 1A. Risk Factors Risk Factors Summary Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at length below. These risks include, among others, the following principal risk factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky. You are encouraged to carefully review our full discussion of the material risk factors relevant to an investment in our business, which follows the brief bulleted list of our principal risk factors set forth below: Our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to continue successfully commercializing our products and any products we may acquire in the future; We have substantial outstanding indebtedness, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations; If we cannot continue successfully commercializing our products and any products that we may acquire in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline; Despite receiving approval by the FDA, additional data may emerge that could change the FDA s position on the product labeling of any of our products, including our abuse-deterrent claims with respect to Xtampza ER, and our ability to market our products successfully may be adversely affected; Xtampza ER, the Nucynta Products, and Belbuca are subject to mandatory Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy REMS programs, which could increase the cost, burden and liability associated with the commercialization of these products; Failure to comply with ongoing governmental regulations for marketing our products, and in particular any failure to promote Xtampza ER s abuse deterrent labeling in compliance with FDA regulations, could delay or inhibit our ability to generate revenues from their sale and could also expose us to claims or other sanctions; Unfavorable outcomes in intellectual property litigation could be costly and potentially limit our ability to commercialize our products; If we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our technologies, products or any products we may acquire, we may lose valuable assets or be unable to compete effectively in our market; We have been, and may continue to be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and result in the loss of valuable assets; Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements; If we are unable to utilize our own sales and marketing capabilities successfully or enter into strategic alliances with marketing collaborators, we may not continue to be successful in commercializing our products and may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue; If the medical community, patients, and healthcare payors do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer; Our products contain controlled substances, the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state and federal law enforcement and other regulatory agencies; Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to continue to commercialize our products and may reduce the prices we are able to obtain for our products; Our products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such pricing regulations may address the

 rebates that manufacturers offer to pharmaceutical benefit managers, or the discounts that manufacturers provide others within the pharmaceutical distribution chain; Social issues around the abuse of opioids, including law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioids and regulatory and enforcement efforts to combat abuse, could decrease the potential market for our products and may adversely impact external investor perceptions of our business; If the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products with abuse deterrent claims that compete with our products, our sales could decline; If the third-party manufacturers of our products fail to devote sufficient time and resources to these products, or their performance is substandard, and/or we encounter challenges with our dedicated manufacturing suite at our third-party manufacturer s site for the manufacturing of Xtampza ER, our costs may be higher than expected and could have a material adverse effect on our business; Because we currently rely on a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient of our products, any production problems with any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us; We depend on wholesale pharmaceutical distributors for retail distribution of our products; if we lose any of our significant wholesale pharmaceutical distributors or their distribution network is disrupted, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected; Our products could be subject to post-marketing requirements, which requirements may, in some cases, not be capable of timely or satisfactory completion without participation in consortia over which we have limited control; Our ability to realize the benefits of the Ironshore Therapeutics, Inc. Ironshore acquisition is substantially dependent on the timely and effective integration of the operations of Collegium and Ironshore; Our business may be adversely affected by certain events or circumstances outside our control, including macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical turmoil; Litigation or regulatory action regarding opioid medications could negatively affect our business; We face substantial competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more successfully than we do; Commercial sales of our products may expose us to expensive product liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all; Our relationships with customers and payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings; and The price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs Our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to continue successfully commercializing our products and any products that we may acquire in the future. Our failure to do so successfully could impair our growth strategy and plans and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results. Our ability to maintain profitability depends upon our ability to realize the full commercial potential of our products and to commercialize successfully any other products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. Our ability to generate revenue from our current or future products depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: realize a commercially viable price for our products; manufacture commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels; sustain a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for the products we sell; obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors; acquire new products, or develop new indications or line extensions for existing products, in the event that revenues from our existing products are impacted by price controls, loss of intellectual property exclusivity or competition; and comply with existing and changing laws and regulations that apply to the pharmaceutical industry, including opioid manufacturers, and to our products specifically, including FDA post-marketing requirements.

 If we fail to maintain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. As of December 31, 2023, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss NOL carryforward of approximately 137.5 million and state NOL carryovers of approximately 202.4 million. The U.S. federal and state NOL carryforwards expire at various dates through 2037. Federal NOLs and certain state NOLs incurred in 2018 and onward have an indefinite expiration under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and applicable state statutes. We also had U.S. federal tax credits of approximately 1.0 million, and state tax credits of approximately 0.7 million. These tax attributes are generally subject to a limited carryover/carryback period and are also subject to the annual limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended IRC 382 ). In 2021, we completed a study to assess the impact of ownership changes, if any, on our ability to use our NOL and tax credit carryovers as defined under IRC 382 (the IRC 382 Study ). As a result of the study, we concluded that there were ownership changes that occurred during the years 2006, 2012 and 2015 that would be subject to IRC 382 limitations. These IRC 382 annual limitations may limit our ability to use pre-ownership change federal NOL carryovers and pre-ownership change federal tax credit carryovers, which may potentially limit our ability to reduce our future federal income tax liability by using these losses. As part of the BDSI acquisition, we acquired an estimated 234.7 million of federal NOL carryovers which are generally subject to a limited carryover/carryback period and are also subject to the annual limitations that may be imposed under IRC 382. We performed an IRC 382 study following the BDSI Acquisition in 2022 and concluded that there were ownership changes that occurred during the years 2006 and 2022 that would be subject to IRC 382 limitations. These IRC 382 annual limitations may limit our ability to use pre-ownership change federal NOL carryovers and pre-ownership change federal tax credit carryovers, which may potentially limit our ability to reduce our future federal income tax liability by using these losses. As of December 31, 2023, remaining net operating losses of 124.3 million are subject to limitation. Refer to Note 17, Income Taxes , to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have substantial outstanding indebtedness, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In July 2024, in connection with the Ironshore acquisition, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement by and among us, certain of our subsidiaries party thereto as guarantors, BioPharma Credit PLC as collateral agent, and BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (investment funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP) as the lenders (the Lenders party thereto (the 2024 Loan Agreement ), of which 645.8 million in principal was outstanding as of November 7, 2024. In addition, we have 241.5 million in 2.875 convertible senior notes due in 2029 (the 2029 Convertible Notes ). We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our existing and future levels of indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, and among other things: requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including the 2024 Term Loan, are at variable rates of interest; diluting the interests of our existing shareholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2029 Convertible Notes; placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than we are or have better access to capital; and 

 50 

Table of Contents 
 increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. Holders of our 2029 Convertible Notes, subject to a limited exception described in the notes, may require us to repurchase their notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and any failure by us to repurchase notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon the conversion when required would constitute a default under the indenture. Additionally, the indenture governing the 2029 Convertible Notes and our 2024 Loan Agreement contain certain covenants and obligations applicable to us, including, without limitation, covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, make acquisitions or other investments or dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business, which could limit our ability to capitalize on business opportunities that may arise or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors. Failure to comply with covenants in the indenture governing the 2029 Convertible Notes or in the 2024 Loan Agreement would constitute an event of default under those instruments, notwithstanding our ability to meet our debt service obligations. A default under the indenture or a fundamental change could also result in a default under one or more of the agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. In such event, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts that would become due. The 2024 Loan Agreement includes various customary remedies for the lenders following an event of default, including the acceleration of repayment of outstanding amounts under the 2024 Loan Agreement and execution upon the collateral securing obligations under the 2024 Loan Agreement. In addition, because our assets are pledged as a security under the 2024 Loan Agreement, if we are not able to cure any default or repay outstanding borrowings, our assets would be subject to the risk of foreclosure by our lenders. Further, amounts outstanding under our 2024 Loan Agreement bear an annual interest rate equal to adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR + 4.50 , and are subject to quarterly amortization payments equal to 2.50 of the original funded amount of the 2024 Term Loan. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any period will fluctuate based on SOFR and other variable interest rates, as applicable. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, in early 2023, several financial institutions closed and were taken into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial services industry or economy in general. Further, investor concerns regarding domestic or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our financial obligations, which could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

 Risks Related to our Products If we cannot continue successfully commercializing our products and any products that we may acquire in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline. Our business and future success are substantially dependent on our ability to continue successfully commercializing our products, including Xtampza ER, the Nucynta Products, Belbuca, Symproic, Jornay and any products that we may acquire in the future. Our ability to continue successfully commercializing our products will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of our products at reasonable cost and with sufficient speed to meet commercial demand; our ability to execute sales and marketing strategies successfully and continually; our success in educating physicians, patients and caregivers about the benefits, administration, use and coverage of our products; with respect to Xtampza ER, the perceived availability and advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of other abuse-deterrent products and treatments with similar indications; our ability to defend successfully any challenges to our intellectual property or suits asserting patent infringement relating to our products; the availability and quality of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products; a continued acceptable safety profile of our products; our ability to acquire new products, or develop new indications or line extensions for existing products, in the event that revenues from our existing products are impacted by price controls, loss of intellectual property exclusivity or competition; and our ability to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including any additional manufacturing or packaging requirements that may become applicable to certain opioid products. Many of these matters are beyond our control and are subject to other risks described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue successfully commercializing or to generate sufficient revenue from our products. If we cannot do so, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. Despite receiving approval by the FDA, additional data may emerge that could change the FDA s position on the product labeling of any of our products, including our abuse-deterrent claims with respect to Xtampza ER, and our ability to market our products successfully may be adversely affected. Xtampza ER was approved with label language describing abuse-deterrent properties of the formulation with respect to the nasal and IV routes of abuse, consistent with Guidance for Industry, Abuse-Deterrent Opioids Evaluation and Labeling. In November 2017, the FDA approved a supplemental NDA for Xtampza ER to include comparative oral pharmacokinetic data from a clinical study evaluating the effect of physical manipulation by crushing Xtampza ER compared with OxyContin and a control (oxycodone hydrochloride immediate-release), results from an oral human abuse potential study and the addition of an oral abuse deterrent claim. The FDA can require changes to the product labeling for any of our products at any time which can impact our ability to generate product sales. In particular, if the FDA determines that our post-marketing data for Xtampza ER does not demonstrate that the abuse-deterrent properties result in reduction of abuse, or demonstrates a shift to routes of abuse that present a greater risk, the FDA may find that product labeling revisions are needed, and potentially require the removal of our abuse-deterrence claims, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue successfully commercializing Xtampza ER.

 Our opioid products are subject to mandatory REMS programs, which could increase the cost, burden and liability associated with the commercialization of these products. The FDA has imposed a class-wide REMS on all IR, ER and long-acting opioid drug products (known as the Opioid Analgesic REMS). The FDA continually evaluates whether the REMS program is meeting its goal of ensuring that the benefit of these drugs continue to outweigh their risks, and whether the goals or elements of the program should be modified. As opioids, Xtampza ER, the Nucynta Products and Belbuca are subject to the Opioid Analgesic REMS. Any modification of the Opioid Analgesic REMS by the FDA to impose additional or more burdensome requirements could increase the costs associated with marketing these products and/or reduce the willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe these products, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to successfully commercialize and generate sufficient revenue from these products. Failure to comply with ongoing governmental regulations for marketing our products, and in particular any failure to promote Xtampza ER s abuse deterrent labeling in compliance with FDA regulations, could delay or inhibit our ability to generate revenues from their sale and could also expose us to claims or other sanctions. In addition to scrutiny by the FDA, advertising and promotion of any pharmaceutical product marketed in the United States is heavily scrutinized by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by government agencies. In particular, Xtampza ER has FDA-approved product labeling that describes its abuse deterrent features, which allows us to promote those features and differentiate Xtampza ER from other opioid products containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredients. Because the FDA closely regulates promotional materials and other promotional activities, even though the FDA-approved product labeling includes a description of the abuse deterrent characteristics of Xtampza ER, the FDA may object to our marketing claims and product advertising campaigns. Engaging in off-label promotion of our products, including Xtampza ER, could subject us to false claims liability under federal and state statutes, and other litigation and/or investigations, and could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of our products from the market, recalls, fines, disgorgement money, operating restrictions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution. Any of these consequences would harm the commercial success of our products, including Xtampza ER. Further, discovery of serious and unanticipated adverse events associated with the product; the emergence of other problems with the product, manufacturer or facility; or our failure to make required regulatory submissions may result in adverse regulatory actions, including withdrawal of the product from the market or the requirement to add or strengthen label warnings about the product. The failure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or the imposition of additional or stronger warnings could delay or preclude us from realizing the full commercial potential of our products. Risks Related to Intellectual Property Unfavorable outcomes in intellectual property litigation could be costly and potentially limit our ability to commercialize our products. Our commercial success depends upon our ability to commercialize products without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Our current or future products, or any uses of them, may now or in the future infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted to be infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products. If we are found to infringe a third party s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing or commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such 

 53 

Table of Contents 
 proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or force us to cease some of our business operations. Any litigation, including any interference or derivation proceedings to determine priority of inventions, oppositions or other post-grant review proceedings to patents in the United States, or litigation against our collaborators may be costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. We expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation, including our pending litigation with Purdue, could compromise the validity and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights or hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our technologies, products or any products we may acquire, we may lose valuable assets or be unable to compete effectively in our market. We depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on patent and trademark laws, unpatented trade secrets and know-how, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States with respect to our proprietary technology and products. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights in the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. We have been, and may continue to be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and result in the loss of valuable assets. We have been, and may continue to be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and unauthorized use by competitors, and to protect our trade secrets, including in connection with our pending litigation against generic competitors that have filed Paragraph IV Certifications relating to certain of our products. In so doing, we may place our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated, rendered unenforceable or limited or narrowed in scope. This litigation is expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. In addition, an adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor, or those with whom they communicate, from using 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed or independently developed, our competitive position would be harmed. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. The United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO requires compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents are required to be paid to the USPTO in several stages over the lifetime of the patents. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, our competitive position would be adversely affected. Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Products If we are unable to utilize our own sales and marketing capabilities successfully or enter into strategic alliances with marketing collaborators, we may not continue to be successful in commercializing our products and may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue. Our commercial organization continues to evolve and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in marketing our products. We recently acquired the sales force supporting Jornay in connection with the Ironshore acquisition and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to build and manage the Jornay sales infrastructure, while continuing to support and maintain our existing sales organization. In addition, we compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. If we are unable to continue to grow and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, including with respect to our acquisition of Jornay, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not remain profitable. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to continue successfully commercializing our products in the United States include: our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; the inability of sales personnel to reach adequate numbers of physicians who may prescribe our products; and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and maintaining an independent sales and marketing organization. If we are not successful in retaining sales and marketing personnel or in maintaining our sales and marketing infrastructure or if we do not preserve strategic alliances with marketing collaborators, agreements with contract sales organizations or collaboration arrangements, we will have difficulty in continuing to commercialize our products. If the medical community, patients, and healthcare payors do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer. Physicians and others in the medical community, patients, and healthcare payors may not continue to accept and use our products, or accept and use any new products that we may acquire. Acceptance and use of our products will depend on a number of factors including: approved indications, warnings and precautions language that may be less desirable than competitive products; perceptions of physicians and other healthcare community members of the safety and efficacy of our products; perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the relevance and efficacy of our abuse deterrent technology; the availability of competitive products; the pricing and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products; 

 55 

Table of Contents 
 the potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative treatments; the convenience and ease of administration to patients of our products; actual and perceived availability and quality of coverage and reimbursement for our products from government or other third-party payors; negative publicity related to our products or negative or positive publicity related to our competitors products; the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; policy initiatives by FDA, HHS, DEA, or other federal or state agencies regarding opioids; our ability to comply with the Opioid Analgesic REMS; and the effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and any licensees and distributors. If our products fail to have an adequate level of acceptance by the medical community, patients, or healthcare payors, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to remain profitable. Since we expect to rely on sales generated by Xtampza ER, the Nucynta Products, Belbuca, Symproic, and Jornay for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to maintain market acceptance would harm our business prospects. Some of our products contain controlled substances, and the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state and federal law enforcement and other regulatory agencies. Some of our products contain controlled substances that are subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution. Xtampza ER s active ingredient, oxycodone, and the Nucynta Products active ingredient, tapentadol hydrochloride and Jornay s active ingredient, methylphenidate hydrochloride, are each classified as Schedule II controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act CSA and regulations of the DEA and the active ingredient in Belbuca, buprenorphine hydrochloride, is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance . A number of states also independently regulate these drugs, including oxycodone, tapentadol, methylphenidate and buprenorphine , as controlled substances. We and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state and federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state and federal laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. Furthermore, the amount of Schedule II substances that can be obtained for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the CSA and DEA regulations. For more information, refer to the section in our Annual Report entitled Business Government Regulation DEA and Opioid Regulation. We may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these controlled substances in order to meet commercial demand. If commercial demand for Xtampza ER, the Nucynta Products or Jornay increases and we cannot meet such demand in a timely fashion because of our limited supply of their active pharmaceutical ingredients, then physicians may perceive such product as unavailable and may be less likely to prescribe it in the future. In addition, controlled substances are also subject to regulations governing manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas (for Schedule I and II substances), recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with commercialization of our products that include controlled substances. The DEA and some states conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or to comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from manufacturing and commercializing our products that contain controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of our products containing controlled substances. Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to continue to commercialize our products and may reduce the prices we are able to obtain for our products. In the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system generally, and the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of opioids in particular, that could affect our ability to commercialize our products. For example, several states, including New York, have imposed taxes or fees on the sale of opioids. Other states, and even the federal government, could impose similar taxes or fees, and such laws 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 and proposals can vary in the tax and fee amounts imposed and the means of calculation. Liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. California and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business. Laws intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms may continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing of our products may be. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court s July 2024 decision to overturn prior established case law giving deference to regulatory agencies interpretations of ambiguous statutory language has introduced uncertainty regarding the extent to which FDA s regulations, policies, and decisions may become subject to increasing legal challenges, delays, and/or changes. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA s approval process may subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Our products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such pricing regulations may address the rebates that manufacturers offer to pharmaceutical benefit managers, or the discounts that manufacturers provide others within the pharmaceutical distribution chain. The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for drug products can vary widely. Current and future legislation may significantly change these approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our products. Refer to the sections in our Annual Report entitled Business Government Regulation Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform for more information. Our ability to market and sell any product successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments are available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels and tiers of preference based on the perceived value and innovation of a given product. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications and establishing administrative hurdles that incentivize use of generic and/or lower cost products first. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with discounts and rebates from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We have agreed to provide such discounts and rebates to certain third-party payors. We expect increasing pressure to offer larger discounts and rebates. Additionally, a greater number of third-party payors may seek discounts and rebates in order to offer or maintain access for our products. We cannot be sure that high-quality coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be and whether it will be satisfactory. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ), for example, contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program under the Medicare program that would subject manufacturers of some brand-name medications without generic or biosimilar competition to a price negotiation process that results in a negotiated maximum fair price (or alternatively requires manufacturer who do not participate in the negotiation process to pay an excise tax for noncompliance), the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and revisions to the way 

 57 

Table of Contents 
 manufacturers provide discounts on Part D drugs. The IRA also caps Medicare beneficiaries annual out-of-pocket drug expenses at 2,000 per year, thereby eliminating the Medicare Part D coverage gap or donut hole. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the IRA. The IRA could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known. Our inability to expand and maintain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to continue to commercialize our products and our overall financial condition. The Affordable Care Act and any changes in healthcare law may increase the difficulty and cost for us to continue to commercialize our products and affect the prices we may obtain. The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that may affect our ability to profitably sell our products, including implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. The Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. There have been significant ongoing judicial, administrative, executive and legislative efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act, and the Affordable Care Act has also been subject to challenges in the courts. Refer to the section in our Annual Report entitled Business Government Regulation Healthcare Reform. Further changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue and maintain profitability. Social issues around the abuse of opioids and stimulants, including law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioids and regulatory and enforcement efforts to combat abuse, could decrease the potential market for our products and may adversely impact external investor perceptions of our business. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies may apply policies and guidelines that seek to limit the availability or use of opioids and stimulants. Such efforts may inhibit our ability to continue to commercialize our products. Aggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of oxycodone or other opioid drugs; the limitations of abuse-resistant formulations; the ability of people who abuse drugs to discover previously unknown ways to abuse opioid drugs and stimulants, including Xtampza ER, the Nucynta Products, Belbuca and Jornay; public inquiries and investigations into prescription drug abuse; litigation; or regulatory activity regarding sales, marketing, distribution or storage of opioid and stimulant drugs could have a material adverse effect on our reputation. Such negative publicity could reduce the potential size of the market for our products, decrease the revenues we are able to generate from their sale and adversely impact external investor perceptions of our business. Similarly, to the extent opioid and stimulant abuse becomes less prevalent or less urgent of a public health issue, regulators and third-party payors may not be willing to pay a premium for abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids. Federal laws have been enacted to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and illicit opioid use, including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes 

 58 

Table of Contents 
 Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. These laws are described in more detail in our Annual Report under the caption Business Government Regulation DEA and Opioid Regulation. If the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products with claims that compete with our products, our sales could decline. Once an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a listed drug which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These generic equivalents would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Additionally, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, FDA will assign therapeutic equivalence ratings for certain prescription drugs approved via the Section 505(b)(2) NDA pathway with respect to other approved drug products and it is unclear how assignment of these ratings will impact the market opportunity for our products. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our products would substantially limit our ability to generate revenues and therefore, to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our products. In the past, we have initiated litigation with generic competitors that have filed Paragraph IV Certifications challenging certain of our patents. While we have entered into settlement agreements with certain competitors, we are currently pursuing litigation to defend against Paragraph IV Certifications related to Belbuca. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that we will continue to be subject to ANDA-related litigation, which can be costly and distracting and has the potential to impact the long-term value of our products. We have sought in the past, and may seek in the future, FDA pediatric exclusivity for some of our products. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months of patent term and marketing exclusivity to existing exclusivity periods for all formulations, dosage forms, and indications for the active moiety, provided that at the time pediatric exclusivity is granted there is not less than nine months of term remaining. The regulatory exclusivity period for Nucynta IR in the United States has been extended through July 3, 2026, following the grant of New Patient Population exclusivity in pediatrics by the FDA in August 2023 based on data from pediatric trials which were submitted in response to the FDA s Pediatric Written Request (the Written Request to evaluate the use of Nucynta as a treatment for pain in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. In June 2024, we announced that the FDA deemed these data to be responsive to its Written Request, granting pediatric exclusivity to the entire Nucynta franchise for an additional six months, to December 27, 2025 for Nucynta ER and January 3, 2027 for Nucynta IR. Whenever we seek pediatric exclusivity, there is no guarantee that the FDA will agree that the Written Request has been satisfied and that we will receive this additional exclusivity, or that we will maintain such exclusivity, if granted. In November 2017, the FDA issued a final guidance to assist the industry in the development of generic versions of approved opioids with abuse-deterrent formulations, including recommendations about the types of studies that companies should conduct to demonstrate that the generic drug is no less abuse-deterrent than its brand-name counterpart. In the second half of 2018, the FDA posted three revised product-specific guidances related to generic abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, including one guidance specifically relating to Xtampza ER, which recommended specific in vivo studies and in vitro study considerations for abuse deterrence evaluations. These guidances are part of the FDA s wider focus on assisting developers of generic abuse-deterrent formulations in navigating the regulatory path to market more quickly. Earlier market entry of generic abuse-deterrent formulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act (CREATES Act), was enacted in 2019 requiring sponsors of approved drugs to provide sufficient quantities of product samples on commercially reasonable, market-based terms to entities developing generic drugs. The law establishes a private right of action allowing developers to sue application holders that refuse to sell them product samples needed to support their applications. If we are required to provide product samples or allocate additional resources to respond to such requests or any legal challenges under this law, our business could be adversely impacted.

 Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties If the third-party manufacturers of our products fail to devote sufficient time and resources to these products, or their performance is substandard, and/or we encounter challenges with our dedicated manufacturing suite at our third-party manufacturer s site for the manufacturing of Xtampza ER, our costs may be higher than expected and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not own any manufacturing facilities in drug development and commercial manufacturing. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing facility and do not have the resources and expertise to manufacture and test, on a commercial scale, the technical performance of our products. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of experienced personnel and contract manufacturers for our products, as well as other vendors to formulate, test, supply, store and distribute our products, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. In 2020, we completed the build-out of a dedicated manufacturing suite for Xtampza ER at a site operated by our contract manufacturing organization, Patheon, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific. This facility requires the maintenance of regulatory approvals and other costs, all of which we absorb. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to leverage the dedicated manufacturing suite in a profitable manner. If the demand for Xtampza ER and any future related products never meets our expectations and forecasts, or if we do not produce the output we plan, we may not be able to realize the return on investment we anticipated, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also transitioned commercial manufacturing for Nucynta ER from Janssen to Patheon. While we were successful in our regulatory approval and validation activities, we could encounter issues in obtaining commercial supply from Patheon s facility due to technical problems or challenges obtaining adequate and/or timely DEA procurement quota. Although we have identified alternate sources for these services, it would be time-consuming, and require us to incur additional costs, to qualify these sources. Our reliance on a limited number of vendors and, in particular, Patheon as our single manufacturer for Xtampza ER and Nucynta ER, exposes us to the following risks, any of which could impact commercialization of our products, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues: Our contract manufacturers, or other third parties we rely on, may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy commercial demand, may experience technical issues that impact quality or compliance with applicable and strictly enforced regulations governing the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, may be affected by natural disasters that interrupt or prevent manufacturing of our products, may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations, may experience shortages of raw materials and may have difficulties finding replacement parts or equipment; Our contract manufacturers could default on their agreements with us to meet our requirements for commercial supplies of our products and/or we could experience technical problems in the operation of our dedicated manufacturing suite; The use of alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary governmental licenses to produce narcotic products is limited. Additionally, the FDA and the DEA must approve any alternative manufacturer of our products, before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce commercial supplies; It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly, or at all. Our contract manufacturers and vendors may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to produce, store and distribute our products successfully; and If our contract manufacturers were to terminate our arrangements or fail to meet our commercial manufacturing demands, we may be forced to delay our development and commercial programs. Failure to obtain the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients or components necessary to manufacture our products could adversely affect our ability to continue to commercialize our products, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Likewise, the inability of any of our sole or limited suppliers to provide components that meet our specifications and requirements could adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, DEA regulations, through the quota procurement process, limit the amount of DEA-controlled active pharmaceutical ingredient we have available for manufacture. Consequently, we are limited in our ability to 

 60 

Table of Contents 
 maintain an appreciable safety stock of finished drug product. Recently, the ADHD market has encountered several supply chain interruptions, due to, among other items, limited DEA quota of methylphenidate hydrochloride, creating a shortage in supply of ADHD medication. In July 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an official health advisory warning, noting that patients who rely on prescription stimulant medications to treat ADHD could experience a disruption to their treatment and disrupted access to care while the shortage persists. While Jornay has not experienced these issues to date, there is no assurance that we will not experience these issues related to Jornay in the future. Our reliance on third parties reduces our control over our manufacturing and commercialization activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards. The FDA and other regulatory authorities require our products to be manufactured according to Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations promulgated by the FDA cGMP ). Any failure by our third-party manufacturer to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of products in a timely manner, could lead to inspection deficiencies, a shortage of commercial product, or potential products liability exposure for any noncompliant distributed products. Such failure could also be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for products previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing civil penalties or pursuing criminal prosecution. Any stock out, or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of any of our products, or the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients or components necessary to manufacture each of our products, could adversely affect our ability to commercialize such products, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Because we currently rely on a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient of our products, any production problems with any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us. We currently rely on a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients of our products. We contract with these suppliers for commercial supply to manufacture our products. Further, our suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products also supply our primary competitor in the extended-release oxycodone space, Purdue. Identifying alternate sources of active pharmaceutical ingredients for our products is generally time-consuming and costly. Any changes that our suppliers make to the respective drug substance raw materials, intermediates, or manufacturing processes would introduce technical and regulatory risks to our downstream drug product supply. If our suppliers were to terminate an arrangement for an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or fail to meet our supply needs (including as a result of any disruptions in personnel or the global supply chain), we might incur substantial costs and be forced to delay our development or commercialization programs. Any such delay could have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply chain disruptions and shortages may limit manufacturing and commercial supply of our products and have a material impact on our business. There are currently global supply chain disruptions and shortages caused by a variety of factors, including geopolitical turmoil, such as the Ukrainian War and current conflict in Israel and Gaza. While we and our suppliers are still able to receive sufficient inventory of the key materials and components needed, we could experience pressure on our supply chain, including shipping delays, higher prices from suppliers, and reduced availability of materials, including excipients and packaging components. To date, supply chain interruptions have not had a material impact on our results of operations. However, if these disruptions and shortages continue, we may in the future experience a material interruption to our supply chain. Such an interruption could have a material adverse impact on our business, including but not limited to, our ability to timely manufacture and distribute our products. Manufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs, delay commercialization or limit commercial supply. In our current commercial manufacturing operations, and as we scale up manufacturing of our products and conduct required stability testing, we may encounter product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues that may require refinement or resolution in order to successfully commercialize our products. In the future, we may identify impurities,

 which could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, delays in our clinical programs and regulatory approval, increases in our operating expenses, failure to obtain or maintain approval or limitations in our commercial supply. We depend on wholesale pharmaceutical distributors for retail distribution of our products; if we lose any of our significant wholesale pharmaceutical distributors or their distribution network is disrupted, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. A significant percentage of our product shipments are to three of our wholesale pharmaceutical distributors. Our loss of any of these wholesale pharmaceutical distributors accounts, or a material reduction in their purchases or a significant disruption to transportation infrastructure or other means of distribution of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The significance of each wholesale pharmaceutical distributor account to our business adversely impacts our ability to negotiate favorable commercial terms with each such distributor, and as a result, we may be forced to accept terms that adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, these wholesaler customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network has undergone, and may continue to undergo, significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market. Consolidation of drug wholesalers has increased, and may continue to increase, competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products. We cannot guarantee that we can manage these pricing pressures or that wholesaler purchases will not fluctuate unexpectedly from period to period. Certain of our opioid products are subject to post-marketing requirements or commitments, which may, in some cases, not be capable of timely or satisfactory completion without participation in consortia over which we have limited control. For certain of our products, we are subject to post-marketing requirements to conduct epidemiological studies and clinical trials, or, in some cases, to conduct post-marketing surveillance or observational studies to gather additional information about our products. For our opioid products, we generally intend to fulfill our post-marketing requirements PMRs by virtue of our participation in the Opioid PMR Consortium OPC ). Although we retain discretion in how to discharge such PMRs, the scale and scope of the studies required by the FDA make it cost prohibitive to discharge these requirements other than by joining the OPC that was formed to conduct them. We are a member of the OPC and engage in decision-making as a member of that organization, but do not have a majority. If the OPC fails to conduct sufficiently rigorous studies or is unable to achieve the patient enrollment or other requirements established by the FDA, we may be unable to satisfy our PMRs and the FDA may choose to withdraw or otherwise restrict its approval of our opioid products. Additionally, there may be certain PMRs or post-marketing commitments that we fulfill on our own for our products, including via the conduct of post-marketing surveillance or observational studies. If such studies lead to the discovery of adverse findings regarding the safety or benefit profiles of our products, then the FDA may choose to withdraw or otherwise restrict the approval of our products or the FDA or we may determine that labeling changes are warranted based on their finding. Such withdrawal or restriction or labeling changes for our products would have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.

 Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy Our ability to realize the benefits from the acquisition of Ironshore is substantially dependent on the timely and effective integration of the operations of Collegium and Ironshore. Our ability to realize the benefits from the acquisition of Ironshore, which closed on September 3, 2024, is substantially dependent on the timely and effective integration of the operations of Collegium and Ironshore. The process of integrating the operations of Collegium and Ironshore could encounter unexpected costs and delays, which include: failure to implement our business plans for the combined businesses and consolidation or expansion of production capacity as planned and where applicable; unanticipated issues associated with our entrance into the ADHD market, which we have no direct prior experience in; unexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers; inability to successfully manage the newly acquire Jornay sales force, while continuing to build and maintain our existing sales organization; unanticipated issues in conforming Ironshore s standards, processes, procedures and internal controls with our operations; increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; adverse effects on our or Ironshore s existing business relationships; unanticipated expenses and liabilities; and unanticipated issues in integrating sales, marketing and administrative functions. If Ironshore has unanticipated or larger than anticipated liabilities for patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, taxes and other known and unknown types of liabilities, there may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of our acquired companies and businesses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or increase the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that Ironshore and we had historically achieved or might achieve separately. If we are unable to timely and effectively integrate the operations of Collegium and Ironshore, the anticipated growth opportunities and other synergies of the Ironshore Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which would adversely affect our costs. Further, even if the integration is timely and effective, we may never realize the benefits expected from the integration of the operations of Ironshore. Our business may be adversely affected by certain events or circumstances outside our control, including macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical turmoil. Events or circumstances outside of our control, including macroeconomic conditions such as recession or depression, inflation, and declines in consumer-spending could result in reduced demand for our products. An economic downturn could result in business closures, higher levels of unemployment, or declines in consumer disposable income which could have an impact on the number of patients seeking and receiving treatment for conditions that might otherwise result in the prescription of our products, as patients may make efforts to avoid or postpone seeking non-essential medical care to allocate their resources to other priorities or essential items. These circumstances, in addition to the impact of geopolitical turmoil, such as the ongoing Ukrainian War and current conflict in Israel and Gaza (including any escalation or expansion), social unrest, political instability in the United States and elsewhere, terrorism, cyberwarfare or other acts of war, may result in reduced demand for our products and negatively impact our sales, results of operations, and liquidity. Security breaches and other disruptions to our, or our vendors , information technology systems may compromise our information and expose us to liability that could adversely impact our financial condition, operations, and reputation. We, our collaborators, third-party providers, distributors, customers and other contractors utilize information technology systems and networks Systems to transmit, store and otherwise process electronic data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain processes, operations and communications including, in some cases, our business proprietary information, and Electronic Data Interchange EDI on purchase orders, invoices, chargebacks,

 among other things. Our Systems, along with those of the third parties whom we rely on to process confidential and sensitive data in a variety of contexts, are potentially vulnerable to a variety of evolving threats that may expose this data to unauthorized persons or otherwise compromise its integrity. These threats may include, but are not limited to, social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), business email compromise, online and offline fraud, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks, access attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. We may expend significant resources to try to protect against these threats to our Systems. Certain data privacy and security laws, as well as industry best practice standards, may require us to implement and maintain security measures. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our Systems and confidential and sensitive data, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. Threat actors and their techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. If we, or a third party upon whom we rely, experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate or sufficient in type or amount to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices. Litigation or regulatory action regarding opioid medications could negatively affect our business. Beginning in 2018, lawsuits alleging damages related to opioids have been filed naming us as a defendant along with other manufacturers of prescription opioid medications. These lawsuits, filed in multiple jurisdictions, are brought by various local governments as well as private claimants, against various manufacturers, distributors and retail pharmacies. These lawsuits generally allege that we had engaged in improper marketing practices related to Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products. In March 2022, we entered into a Master Settlement Agreement resolving 27 pending opioid-related lawsuits brought against us by cities, counties, and other subdivisions in the United States. As part of the Master Settlement Agreement, we paid 2.75 million to the plaintiffs and the cases were dismissed, with prejudice. In late March 2023, three new cases were filed in three federal courts, naming us as one of numerous defendants, from which we have been dismissed. Certain governmental and regulatory agencies are focused on the abuse of opioid medications, a concern we share, and we have received Civil Investigative Demands or subpoenas from four state attorneys general investigating our sales and marketing of opioids and seeking documents relating to the manufacture, marketing and sale of opioid medications. In December 2021, we entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance with the Massachusetts Attorney General pursuant to which we provided certain assurances and agreed to pay certain of the Massachusetts Attorney General s costs of investigation, in exchange for closure of the investigation and a release of claims pertaining to the subject matter of the investigation. We are cooperating fully in the open investigations. Managing litigation and responding to governmental investigations is costly and may involve a significant diversion of management attention. Such proceedings are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy periods of time. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations may involve injunctive relief or substantial monetary penalties, either or both of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows. We face substantial competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more successfully than we do. Competition in the pain and opioid market is intense. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Belbuca, Xtampza ER, and the Nucynta Products compete with oral opioids, transdermal opioids, local anesthetic patches, and implantable and external infusion pumps that can be used for infusion of opioids and local anesthetics. Products of these types are marketed by Actavis, Endo, Mallinckrodt, Purdue, Teva, and others. Jornay competes with currently marketed, branded and generic methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD. Products of these types are marketed by J J Innovative Medicines, Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tris Pharma, Novartis AG, Noven Therapeutics, LLC, UCB SA, Aytu BioScience, Inc. Adlon Therapeutics, Inc. Some of these current and potential future competitors may be addressing the 

 64 

Table of Contents 
 same therapeutic areas or indications as we are. Many of our current and potential future competitors have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, have substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial, technical, human and managerial resources than we do, and have more institutional experience than we do. Our competitors have developed or may develop technologies that are, or may be, the basis for competitive products that are safer, more effective or less costly than our products. Moreover, oral medications, transdermal drug delivery systems, such as drug patches, injectable products and implantable drug delivery devices are currently available treatments for chronic pain, are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. These treatments will compete with our products and the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products to receive widespread acceptance. Commercial sales of our products and any products we acquire, may expose us to expensive product liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all. We currently carry product liability insurance. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients; healthcare providers; or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may cause us to incur significant costs to defend the litigation. Our relationships with customers and payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings. Healthcare providers, physicians and payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our products. Our arrangements with payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors directly, we may provide reimbursement guidance and support regarding our products to our customers and patients. Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients rights are and will be applicable to our business. If a government authority were to conclude that we provided improper advice to our customers and/or encouraged the submission of false claims for reimbursement, we could face action by government authorities. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Refer to the section in our Annual Report entitled Business Government Regulation Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements for more information. We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and/or health epidemics, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, health epidemic or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our facilities, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it might become difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business, and any disruption could last for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place, and the technology that we may rely upon to implement such plans, may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

 Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment. The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors described in these Risk Factors, some of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our business model, prospects or actual operating performance. The realization of any of these risks, or any of a broad range of other risks discussed in this report, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Virginia law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. Certain provisions of Virginia law, the state in which we are incorporated, and our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hamper a third party s acquisition of us, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, these provisions make it more difficult for our shareholders to remove our Board of Directors or management or elect new directors to our Board of Directors. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to capital markets. Sales of our common stock in the public market, either by us or by our current shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our securities. Moreover, the exercise of options and other issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock will dilute your ownership interests and may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock. Sales of our common stock in the public market, either by us or by our current shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our securities. All of the shares of our common stock held by our current shareholders may be immediately eligible for resale in the open market either in compliance with an exemption under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an effective resale registration statement that we have previously filed with the SEC. Such sales, along with any other market transactions, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 684,223 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 18.74 per share, of which options to purchase 684,083 shares of our common stock were then exercisable. The exercise of options at prices below the market price of our common stock could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock. Additional dilution may result from the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with collaborations or manufacturing arrangements or in connection with other financing efforts.

 There can be no assurance that we will repurchase additional shares of our common stock at all or at favorable prices. In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 150.0 million of shares of our common stock through June 30, 2025 (the 2024-2025 Repurchase Program ). The 2024-2025 Repurchase Program permits us to effect repurchases through a variety of methods, including open-market purchases (including pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act), privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. In May 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to repurchase 35.0 million of our common stock, as part of the 2024-2025 Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,062,548 shares at a weighted-average price of 32.94 per share for a total of 35.0 million under the 2024-2025 Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, 115 million remained available for share repurchases under the 2024-2025 Repurchase Program. Additional share repurchases under the 2024-2025 Repurchase Program will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, our results of operations and financial condition, the price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and other factors that we may deem relevant. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock at favorable prices, if at all. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Purchases of Equity Securities The following table sets forth shares of common stock repurchased under our 2024-2025 Repurchase Program, as well as shares transferred to us from employees in satisfaction of minimum tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of performance share units and restricted stock units during the three months ended September 30, 2024: 

Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs (1) Maximum approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs (in thousands) July 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 174,285 32.93 173,659 115,000 August 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 2,352 35.62 115,000 September 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 1,059 36.07 115,000 Total 177,696 (2) 32.98 173,659 (2) 115,000 (1) The 2024-2025 Repurchase Program was announced on January 3, 2024. The 2024-2025 Repurchase Program provides for the repurchase of up to 150.0 million of outstanding shares of our common stock at any time or times through June 30, 2025. The 2024-2025 Repurchase Program did not expire during the three months ended September 30, 2024, nor do we currently plan to terminate the 2024-2025 Repurchase Program prior to expiration. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing or number of shares of any repurchases in the future. (2) The difference, if any, between the total number of shares purchased and the total number of shares purchased as part of a publicly announced program relates to common stock withheld by us for employees to satisfy their tax withholding obligations arising upon the vesting of performance share units and restricted stock units granted under our Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan.
