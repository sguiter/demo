have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities it engages, execute agreements with the Company
waiving any claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, there is no guarantee that such persons will execute such
agreements. The remaining net proceeds (not held in the Trust Account) may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence

balance may be released to the Company to pay the Company s tax obligations. On November 9, 2022, shares were redeemed

The
Company will either seek shareholder approval of any Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders
may seek to convert their shares into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, less any taxes
then due but not yet paid, or provide shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to the Company by means of a tender offer
for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, less any taxes then due but
not yet paid. These shares have been recorded at redemption value and are classified as temporary equity, in accordance with Financial

any shareholder vote required to approve any Business Combination, the Sponsor and any of the Company s officers and directors
that hold Founder Shares (as described in Note 6) (the Initial Shareholders will agree (i) to vote any of their respective
shares, including the ordinary shares sold to the Initial Shareholders in connection with the organization of the Company (the Initial
Shares ), ordinary shares included in the Private Units to be sold in the Private Placement, and any ordinary shares which were

and Articles of Association with respect to the Company s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business
Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction
with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) and Private Shares into the right to receive cash
from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer
in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend
the provisions of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders rights of pre-Business
Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares and Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding

Pursuant

 Aggregate Stock Consideration to the current shareholders of the Company (the Shareholders ),
among which, ordinary shares (the Closing Payment Shares will be delivered to the Shareholders at the Closing

of the representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in the Merger Agreement (the Holdback Shares ). On August

(the Amendment No. 1 ). Pursuant to the Amendment No. 1, the Aggregate Stock Consideration will be ordinary shares

to the shareholders at the Closing and ordinary shares will be held back by Purchaser for one year after the closing of the Merger
Agreement as security for indemnification obligation of the representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in the Merger
Agreement (the Holdback Shares ). The Closing Payment Shares consist of Class B ordinary shares and 
Class A ordinary shares. On October 27, 2023, the parties entered into an Amendment No. 2 to the Merger Agreement (the Amendment
No. 2 ). Pursuant to the Amendment No. 2, the Aggregate Stock Consideration will be ordinary shares of Purchaser,

Liquidation 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net loss of and had cash used in operating activities of .
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of with negative working capital of . If the Company does not complete
a Business Combination within 12 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company will trigger an automatic winding
up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result,
this has the same effect as if the Company had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly,
no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. However, if the
Company anticipate that the Company may not be able to consummate its initial Business Combination within 12 months (or 15 months if
the Company has filed a proxy statement, registration statement or similar filing for an initial Business Combination within 12 months
from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering but have not completed the initial Business Combination within such 12-month period),
the Company may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination three times (or two times)
by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a Business Combination). Pursuant to the terms of
the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and American
Stock Transfer Trust Company on July 30, 2021, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate the initial
Business Combination, the Company s insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable
deadline, must deposit into the Trust Account per share in either case), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline.
On November 1, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company, through written resolution, approved the amendment to the restated and amended
memorandum and article of association and the Trust Agreement to extend the business combination period nine times for an additional
one month each time from November 10, 2022 to August 10, 2023 by depositing into the Trust Account for each issued and outstanding
Public Shares that has not been redeemed for each one-month extension. On August 3, 2023, the shareholders of the Company, through annual
shareholders meeting, approved the amendment to the restated and amended memorandum and article of association and the Trust Agreement
to extend the business combination period twelve times for an additional one month each time from August 10, 2023 to August 10, 2024
by depositing into the Trust Account for each issued and outstanding Public Shares that has not been redeemed for each one-month
extension. On August 6, 2024, the shareholders of the Company, through annual shareholders meeting, approved the amendment to
the restated and amended memorandum and article of association and the Trust Agreement to extend the business combination period twelve
times for an additional one month each time from August 10, 2024 to February 10, 2025 by depositing into the Trust Account by the lesser
of (a) and (b) for each issued and outstanding Public Shares that has not been redeemed for each one-month extension. The
insiders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid
in the event that the Company is unable to close a Business Combination unless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to
do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination, or, at the lender s
discretion, converted upon consummation of our Business Combination into additional private units at a price of per unit. The
Company s shareholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder
wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination. In the event that
the Company receives notice from the Company s insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an
extension, the Company intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline.
In addition, the Company intends to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had
been timely deposited. The Company s insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to
extend the time for the Company to complete the initial Business Combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of the Company s
insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate the Company initial Business Combination, such insiders (or their affiliates
or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If the Company is unable to consummate the Company s initial Business Combination
within such time period, the Company will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the
Company s outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion
of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not necessary to pay taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve.
However, the Company may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims
of the Company s public shareholders. In the event of dissolution and liquidation, the warrants and rights will expire and will
be worthless. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The Company may need to raise
additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor or third parties as discussed in Note 6. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern in accordance with the authoritative guidance in ASU 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution, should the Company be unable to complete a Business Combination, raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has until December 10, 2024 to consummate a Business Combination.
It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated
by this date without an extension to the acquisition period, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No adjustments
have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after December 10, 2024.

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements with another
public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition
period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive
and the Company did not have any other dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into
ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic income

Rights 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the required time period and the Company redeems the public shares for
the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and the rights will expire
worthless. 

Warrants 

The
Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing
of this Initial Public Offering. No Public Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration
statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary
shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Public
Warrants is not effective within 52 business days from the consummation of a Business Combination, the holders may, until such time as
there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration
statement, exercise the Public Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of
the Securities Act provided that such exemption is available. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be
able to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of the Business
Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company may call the warrants for redemption (excluding the Private Warrants), in whole and not in part, at a price of per warrant: 

at
 any time while the Public Warrants are exercisable, 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each Public Warrant holder, 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share, for any 20 trading days within
 a 30 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the notice of redemption to Public Warrant holders, and 

if,
 and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the issuance of the ordinary shares underlying such
 warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter
 until the date of redemption. 

The
Private Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering. The private
warrants (including the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable
until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination (except as described herein). 

If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary
dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary
shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the
Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution
from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire
worthless. The Company assessed the key terms applicable to the Public Warrants as well as the Private Warrants and believes the Public
Warrants and Private Warrants, if were issued, should be classified as equity in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815.

refer to Note 1 for detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the founder shares issued and outstanding on the date of the Company s prospectus for its initial public offering, as
well as the holders of the Private Units (and all underlying securities) and any securities our initial shareholders, officers, directors
or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to
an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this Initial Public Offering. The holders of the majority of the founder
shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these ordinary
shares are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Units (and underlying securities) and securities issued
in payment of working capital loans (or underlying securities) or loans to extend our life can elect to exercise these registration rights
at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration
rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a Business Combination. We will bear the expenses
incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on March 18, 2021 and formed for the purpose of entering into a
merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one
or more businesses or entities. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial
public offering and the sale of the Private Units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

We
presently have no revenue, have had losses since inception from incurring formation costs and have had no operations other than the active
solicitation of a target business with which to complete a business combination. We have relied upon the sale of our securities and loans
from our officers and directors to fund our operations. 

On
August 10, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 5,000,000 Units and the underwriters exercised the option in
full of 750,000 units (the Over-Allotment Units ), which was consummated also on August 10, 2021. Each Unit consists of
one ordinary share Ordinary Share ), one warrant Warrant entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one
Ordinary Share at a price of 11.50 per whole share, and one right Right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Ordinary
Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units (including the Over-Allotment Units) were sold at an offering
price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 57,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial business combination,
the Company consummated the Private Placement of 307,500 Private Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds
of 3,075,000. A total of 58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units (including the Over-Allotment Units) and the Private
Placements were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders. The Company incurred
 1,207,980 in initial public offering related costs, including 1,006,250 of underwriting fees and 201,730 of initial public offering
costs. 

We
will not issue fractional shares. As a result, one must (1) exercise warrants in multiples of two warrants, at a price of 11.50 per
full share, to validly exercise the warrants; and (2) hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of the rights
upon closing of a business combination. 

Our
management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the initial business combination and
the Private Placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally towards consummating a business
combination.

Results
of Operations 

Our
entire activity from inception up to August 10, 2021 was in preparation for the initial public offering. Since the initial public offering,
our activity has been limited to the evaluation of business combination candidates, and we will not be generating any operating revenues
until the closing and completion of our initial business combination. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public
company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses
to increase substantially after this period as we are getting closer to secure a deal to merge. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 64,590, which was comprised of general and administrative expenses, dividend
income and interest income. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 80,081, which was comprised of general and administrative expenses,
dividend income and interest income. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 77,581 which was comprised of general and administrative expenses, dividend
income and interest income. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 10,696, which was comprised of general and administrative expenses,
dividend income and interest income. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
August 10, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering of 5,000,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds
of 50,000,000. Also on August 10, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full of 750,000 units at a price of
 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 7,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated
the sale of 307,500 Private Units, at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 3,075,000. 

Following
the initial public offering and the exercise of the over-allotment option, a total of 58,075,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We
incurred 1,207,980 in initial public offering related costs, including 1,006,250 of underwriting fees and 201,730 of initial public
offering Costs. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash outside our trust account of 18,488, working capital deficit of 3,362,330 and investments
held in the Trust Account of 2,607,985. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to
acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole
or in part as consideration to effect our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other
net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions
and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses
or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside
of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

We
intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate
and complete a business combination.

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, 
the Company had initially until August 10, 2022 to consummate a Business Combination. Originally, the Company may elect, following the
Trust Agreement, to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to three times, each by an additional three months
(or up to 21 months total) subject to the Sponsor depositing into the Trust Account 575,000 for each three month extension. On August
4, 2022, an extension payment of 575,000 was deposited by the Sponsor into the Company s Trust Account to extend the August 10,
2022 deadline to November 10, 2022. Additionally, as approved by its shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on November 9,
2022, the Company amended its amended and restated memorandum and article of association and the Trust Agreement to extend the date by
which the Company has to consummate a business combination nine times for an additional one month each time from November 10, 2022 to
August 10, 2022 by depositing into the trust account 0.0416 per issued and outstanding Public Shares that has not been redeemed for
each one-month extension. 

The
Company has issued the following unsecured promissory notes (collectively, the Promissory Notes ): (i) the non-interest
bearing, unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of 575,000 issued by Nova Vision to Sponsor in exchange for Sponsor depositing
such amount into the Trust Account in order to extend the amount of time Nova Vision has available to complete a business combination

notes in the amount of 1,500,000, 170,000, 48,750, 50,000, 85,000, 58,000, 60,000, 20,000 and 32,000 issued on September 28,
2023, January 10, 2024, February 9, 2024, March 8, 2024, May 21, 2024, July 9, 2024, August 27, 2024, October 22, 2024 and November 8,
2024, respectively, to the Sponsor for Nova Vision s working capital ; (iii) twelve additional non-interest bearing,
unsecured promissory notes, each in the principal amount of 69,763 (representing 0.045 per NOVA Ordinary Share issued at
the IPO that have not been redeemed) issued on August 3, 2023, September 6, 2023, October 6, 2023, November 6, 2023, December 6, 2023,
January 6, 2024, February 8, 2024, March 8, 2024, April 5, 2024, May 9, 2024, June 7, 2024 and July 5, 2024, respectively, in exchange
for Sponsor depositing such each amount into the Trust Account in order to extend the amount of time Nova Vision has available to complete
a business combination for a period of three months through August 10, 2024; and (iv) four additional non-interest bearing, unsecured
promissory notes, each in the principal amount of 6,301 (representing 0.03 per NOVA Ordinary Share issued at the IPO that
have not been redeemed) issued on August 6, 2024, September 10, 2024, October 6, 2024 and November 8, 2024, respectively, in exchange
for Sponsor depositing such each amount into the Trust Account in order to extend the amount of time Nova Vision has available to complete
a business combination for a period of three months through December 10, 2024. 

As
of the date of this report, the Company has until December 10, 2024 to consummate a business combination but may further extend the period
five more times for one month each time up to February 10, 2025. If a Business Combination is not consummated by December 10, 2024 and
an extension is not requested by the Sponsor, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management
has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur and an extension is not requested by the Sponsor,
raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying
amounts of assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2024. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. This belief
is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest,
we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we
have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less
than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use from the trust account is minimal as a result of
the current interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is
currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members
of our management team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. In
the event that the business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to
repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Such loans would be evidenced by
promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender s discretion, up to 500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional
private units at a price of 10.00 per unit. The terms of such loans by our initial shareholders, officers and directors, if any, have
not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Off-balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than an agreement
to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative
services to the Company. We began incurring these fees on April 1, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier
of the completion of the business combination and the Company s liquidation. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during
the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following critical
accounting policies. 

Warrants 

The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet
the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under
ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could
potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions
for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance
and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For
issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants
are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. 

As
the warrants issued upon the Initial Public Offering and private placements meet the criteria for equity classification under ASC 815,
therefore, the warrants are classified as equity. 

6 

Ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption 

We
account for our ordinary shares subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability
instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption
rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our
ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain
future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside
of the shareholders equity section of our balance sheets. 

Net
Income Per Ordinary Share 

We
comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. In order to determine the net income attributable
to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, we first considered the undistributed income allocable to both the redeemable
ordinary share and non-redeemable ordinary share and the undistributed income is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends
paid. We then allocated the undistributed income ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable
and non-redeemable ordinary shares. Any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the ordinary shares subject to possible
redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not considered the
effect of the warrants and rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and the private placements in the calculation of diluted net income
per share, since the exercise of the warrants and rights is contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such
warrants and rights would be anti-dilutive and we did not have any other dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially,
be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted income per share is
the same as basic income per share for the period presented. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The
net proceeds of the IPO held in the trust account may be invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of
180 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in US treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments,
we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this
report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due
to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial reporting and record keeping.
As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and applicable SEC reporting requirements. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter of September 30, 2024 covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Item
1 Legal Proceedings 

The
Company is not party to any legal proceedings as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
under this item. However, the risks set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year
ended December 31, 2023 which was filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024 are available for your review at https://www.sec.gov. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On
August 10, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering IPO of 5,000,000 units (the Units ). Also on
August 10, 2021, the underwriters exercised the option in full of 750,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit. The total aggregate issuance
by the Company of 5,750,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit resulted in gross proceeds of 57,500,000. Each unit consists of one
ordinary share Ordinary Share ), one warrant Warrant entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary
Share at a price of 11.50 per whole share, and one right Right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon
the consummation of an initial business combination. The Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by
the SEC on August 5, 2021. EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC acted as the representative for the underwriters for the
IPO. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO and the sale of the over-allotment units on August 10, 2021, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement with Nova Pulsar Holdings Limited, its sponsor, of 307,500 units (the Private Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of 3,075,000. These securities (other than our IPO securities) were
issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended pursuant to Section 4(2) of the securities
Act. 

The
private units are identical to the units sold in this offering except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions.
Additionally, because the private units will be issued in a private transaction, our sponsor and its permitted transferees will be allowed
to exercise the private warrants for cash even if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such
warrants is not effective and receive unregistered ordinary shares. Furthermore, our sponsor has agreed (A) to vote the ordinary shares
underlying the private units, or private shares, in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or
vote in favor of, an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would stop our public shareholders
from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 21 months if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering
unless we provide public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares from the trust account in connection with any
such vote, (C) not to convert any private shares for cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve our
proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity and (D) that the private shares shall not participate in
any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated. Our sponsor has also agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell any of the private units or underlying securities (except to the same permitted transferees as the insider shares and
provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the insider shares must agree to, each
as described above) until 30 calendar days after the completion of our initial business combination. 

8 

As
of August 16, 2021, a total of 58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the public offering and the private placement consummated simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO and the over-allotment option were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company s
public shareholders. The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in U.S. government treasury bills with
a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. 

We
paid a total of 1,006,250 in underwriting discounts and commissions (not including the 1.3 deferred underwriting commission payable
at the consummation of initial business combination) and approximately 201,730 for other costs and expenses related to our formation
and the initial public offering.
