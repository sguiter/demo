 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes"), Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"), and the Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 was million, million, and million respectively. As the Credit Facility has a variable interest rate and has no equity component, the book value of the Credit Facility is equal to the fair value. The estimated fair value of the 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes at December 31, 2023 was million and million respectively. The valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of the Company's long-term debt are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are derived from broker quotations. 
 
 Deferred compensation assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Company s deferred compensation plan, which allows for pre-tax salary deferrals for certain employees. Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liabilities are derived using quoted prices in active markets of the asset selections made by plan participants. Deferred compensation liabilities are classified in Level 2, the fair value classification as defined under FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements , because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments. The Company holds insurance investments to partially offset the Company s liabilities under its deferred compensation plan, which are recorded at fair value each period using the cash surrender value of the insurance investments. 
 
 The cash surrender value of the life insurance policy was and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amounts owed to employees participating in the deferred compensation plan at September 30, 2024 were million compared to million at December 31, 2023 and are included in other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation of a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the earn-out liability associated with the acquisition of MENU Technologies AG (the "MENU Acquisition"). Significant inputs used in the simulation are not observable in the market and thus the liability represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the liability on the acquisition date will be reflected as cash used in financing activities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Any amount paid in excess of the liability on the acquisition date will be reflected as cash used in operating activities. 
 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company determined that there would be no earn-out payment related to the MENU Acquisition. As such, the Company reduced the fair value of the earn-out liability to zero. The earn-out period expired on July 31, 2024 with no payment made.

Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
 
 We monitor certain key performance indicators and non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation and management of our business; certain key performance indicators and non-GAAP financial measures are provided in this Quarterly Report because we believe they are useful in facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Key performance indicators and non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect and should be viewed independently of our financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Key performance indicators and non-GAAP financial measures are not forecasts or indicators of future or expected results and should not have undue reliance placed upon them by investors. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 
 Within this Quarterly Report the Company makes reference to annual recurring revenue, or ARR, and active sites, which are both key performance indicators. The Company uses ARR and active sites as key performance indicators of the scale of our subscription services for both new and existing customers. 
 
 ARR is the annualized revenue from our subscription services, which includes subscription fees for our SaaS solutions and related support, managed platform development services, and transaction-based fees for 
 37 

Table of Contents 

payment processing services. We generally calculate ARR by annualizing the monthly recurring revenue for all active sites as of the last day of each month for the respective reporting period. ARR is an operating measure, it does not reflect our revenue determined in accordance with GAAP, and ARR should be viewed independently of, and not combined with or substituted for, our revenue and other financial information determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, ARR is not a forecast of future revenue and investors should not place undue reliance on ARR as an indicator of our future or expected results. 
 
 Active sites represent locations active on our subscription services as of the last day of the respective reporting period. Our key performance indicators ARR and active sites are presented as two subscription service product lines: 
 
 Engagement Cloud consisting of Punchh, PAR Retail, PAR Ordering, and Plexure product offerings. 
 Operator Cloud consisting of PAR POS, PAR Payment Services, PAR Pay, Data Central, and TASK product offerings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP, this Quarterly Report contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items below. The income tax effect of the below adjustments, with the exception of non-recurring income taxes, were not tax-effected due to the valuation allowance on all of our net deferred tax assets. 
 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Additionally, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies. 
 
 Non-GAAP subscription service gross margin percentage is adjusted to exclude amortization from acquired and internally developed software, stock-based compensation, and severance costs included within subscription service cost of sales. 

Non-GAAP Measure or Adjustment Definition Usefulness to management and investors Non-GAAP subscription service gross margin percentage Represents subscription service gross margin percentage adjusted to exclude amortization from acquired and internally developed software, stock-based compensation, and severance. 
 We believe that non-GAAP subscription service gross margin percentage and adjusted EBITDA provide useful perspectives with respect to the Company's core operating performance and ongoing cash earnings by adjusting for certain non-cash and non-recurring charges that may not be indicative of our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA Represents net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude certain non-cash and non-recurring charges that may not be indicative of our financial performance. 
 Non-GAAP diluted net loss per share Represents net loss per share excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain non-cash and non-recurring charges that may not be indicative of our financial performance. 
 We believe that adjusting our non-GAAP diluted net loss per share to remove non-cash and non-recurring charges provides a useful perspective with respect to the Company's operating performance as well as comparisons to past and competitor operating results. 
 Stock-based compensation Consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation because management does not view these non-cash charges as part of our core operating performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance as well as comparisons to past and competitor operating results. Contingent consideration Adjustment reflects a non-cash reduction to the fair market value of the contingent consideration liability related to the MENU Acquisition. We exclude changes to the fair market value of our contingent consideration liability because management does not view these non-cash, non-recurring charges as part of our core operating performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance as well as comparisons to past and competitor operating results.

Table of Contents 

Non-GAAP Measure or Adjustment Definition Usefulness to management and investors Transaction costs Adjustment reflects non-recurring professional fees incurred in transaction due diligence, including costs incurred in the acquisitions of Stuzo and TASK Group. We exclude professional fees incurred in corporate development because management does not view these non-recurring charges, which are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our transactions, as part of our core operating performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance, comparisons to past and competitor operating results, and additional means to evaluate expense trends. Gain on insurance proceeds Adjustment reflects the gain on insurance proceeds due to the settlement of a legacy claim. We exclude these non-recurring adjustments because management does not view these costs as part of our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance as well as comparisons to past and competitor operating results. Severance Adjustment reflects severance tied to non-recurring restructuring events included in cost of sales, sales and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and research and development expense. Discontinued operations Adjustment reflects income from discontinued operations related to the disposition of our Government segment. Impairment loss Adjustment reflects impairment loss included in general and administrative expense related to the discontinuance of the Brink POS trade name. Other expense, net Adjustment reflects foreign currency transaction gains and losses, rental income and losses, and other non-recurring expenses recorded in other expense, net in the accompanying statements of operations. Non-recurring income taxes Adjustment reflects a partial release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting from the Stuzo Acquisition. We exclude these non-cash and non-recurring adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted net loss per share because management does not view these costs as part of our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance, comparisons to past and competitor operating results, and additional means to evaluate expense trends. Non-cash interest Adjustment reflects non-cash amortization of issuance costs and discount related to the Company's long-term debt. Acquired intangible assets amortization Adjustment reflects amortization expense of acquired developed technology included within cost of sales and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. 
 
 The tables below provide reconciliations between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, diluted net income (loss) per share and non-GAAP diluted net loss per share, and subscription service gross margin percentage and non-GAAP subscription service gross margin percentage. Amounts presented in the reconciliations and other tables presented herein may not sum due to rounding.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 105.8 million and short-term investments of 12.6 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less, including money market funds. Short-term investments are held-to-maturity investment securities consisting of investment-grade interest bearing instruments, primarily treasury bills and notes, which are stated at amortized cost. 
 
 Cash used in operating activities was 28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities of 10.1 million was substantially driven by an increase in cash used relating to our discontinued operations. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 178.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 293.6 million of cash consideration paid in connection with the Stuzo Acquisition and the TASK Group Acquisition (net of cash acquired) and capital expenditures of 4.0 million for developed technology costs associated with our software platforms, partially offset by 92.1 million of cash consideration received in connection with the disposition of PGSC and RRC and 24.9 million of proceeds from net sales of short-term held-to-maturity investments. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 279.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in financing activities of 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of a private placement of common stock of 194.5 million (net of issuance costs) and 87.3 million (net of issuance costs) from the Credit Facility. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations. 
 
 We expect our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months our total contractual obligations are 55.4 million, consisting of purchase commitments for normal operations (purchase of inventory, software licensing, use of external labor, and third-party cloud services) of 36.3 million, interest payments on long-term debt of 17.1 million and facility lease obligations of 2.0 million. We expect to fund such commitments with cash provided by operating activities and our sources of liquidity. 
 
 Our non-current contractual obligations are 550.2 million, consisting of purchase commitments for normal operations (purchase of inventory, software licensing, use of external labor, and third-party cloud services) of 41.1 million, interest payments of 29.3 million and principal payments of 475.0 million related to long-term debt, and facility leases of 4.8 million. Refer to Note 8 Debt of the notes to interim condensed consolidated financial statements in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)" of this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 
 Our actual cash needs will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, growth of our SaaS revenues, the timing and extent of spending to support our product development and acquisition integration efforts, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, market acceptance of our products, and the factors described above in "Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, in the 2023 Annual Report, and in our other filings with the SEC. 
 
 From time to time, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, and debt financing arrangements. In addition, our board of directors and management regularly evaluate our business, strategy, and financial plans and prospects. As part of this evaluation, the board of directors and management periodically consider strategic alternatives to maximize value for our shareholders, including strategic transactions such as an acquisition, or a sale or spin-off of non-strategic company assets or businesses. We cannot provide assurance that any additional financing or strategic alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

Table of Contents 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Our financial statements are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and adequacy on a consistent basis. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, the recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at fair value, the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment including right-to-use assets and liabilities, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, valuation allowances for receivables, valuation of excess and obsolete inventories, and measurement of contingent consideration at fair value. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our estimates are subject to uncertainties, including those associated with market conditions, risks and trends. Refer to "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report for additional information. Our critical accounting policies have not changed materially from the discussion of those policies included under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 Our primary exposures relate to certain non-dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia. These primary currencies are the Great British Pound, the Euro, the Swiss Franc, the Serbian Dinar, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Singapore dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Indian Rupee, the Japanese Yen, the Polish Zloty, and the Chinese Renminbi. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue and net income (loss) as expressed in U.S. dollars. We also have foreign currency risk related to foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany balances denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on these foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our revenues and net income (loss) was not material. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 120.0 million, 265.0 million, and 90.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding on the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the Credit Facility respectively. 
 
 We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized debt issuance costs and discount on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our Notes as they bear interest at fixed rates. However, the fair value of the long-term debt changes when the market price of our common stock fluctuates or interest rates change. 
 
 The Credit Facility contains a variable interest rate, presenting interest rate exposure based on the rate selected by management.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, did not identify changes that occurred in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The information in Note 12 "Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to interim condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements (unaudited)" is incorporated herein by reference. We do not believe that we have any pending litigation that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The risks described in the Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors section of our 2023 Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Except as modified, updated, or supplemented by the risks described in the Risk Factors section of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report remain current in all material respects. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, including in the sections "Forward-Looking Statements," Part I, Item 2. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Part 1, Item 1. "Financial Statements (unaudited)." 

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 On August 12, 2024, the Company issued 970 shares of its common stock, representing an issuance date fair value of 0.1 million, as a stock award to a former employee in connection with the sale of RRC. The shares of common stock were issued without registration in a private transaction exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 
 Under our equity incentive plan, employees may elect to have us withhold shares to satisfy minimum statutory federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of their restricted stock and restricted stock units. When we withhold these shares, we are required to remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the market price of the shares withheld, which could be deemed a purchase of shares by us on the date of withholding. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 412 shares were withheld. 
 
 The table below presents information regarding the Company's purchases of its common stock for the time periods presented. 
 
 Period Total Number of Shares Withheld Average Price Paid Per Share July 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 August 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 412 51.54 September 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 Total 412 51.54
