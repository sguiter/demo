 The Company recognizes revenue upon the satisfaction of its performance obligations under its contracts. The timing of revenue recognition varies for our different revenue streams. In general, the timing includes recognition of revenue over time as services are being performed as well as recognition of revenue at a point in time for delivery of products.

 Transaction Price Allocations to Remaining Performance Obligations 
 We are required to disclose the aggregate amount of our transaction prices that are allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2024. However, we are permitted to utilize the following exemptions: 
 1) Performance obligations that are part of a contract with an expected duration of one year or less; 
 2) Revenue recognized from the satisfaction of performance obligations where we have a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to customers; and 
 3) Contracts that contain variable consideration, such as index-based pricing or variable volumes, that is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that is part of a series. 
 The majority of our contracts qualify for one of these exemptions. For the remaining contract types that involve revenue recognition over a long-term period and include long-term fixed consideration (adjusted for indexing as required), we determined our allocations of transaction price that relate to unsatisfied performance obligations. For our tiered pricing offshore transportation contracts, we provide firm capacity for both fixed and variable consideration over a long-term period. Therefore, we have allocated the remaining contract value to future periods.

These repurchases may be made pursuant to a repurchase plan or plans that comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Repurchase Program will be reviewed no later than December 31, 2024 and may be suspended or discontinued at any time prior thereto. The Repurchase Program does not create an obligation for us to acquire a particular number of Class A Common Units and any Class A Common Units repurchased will be canceled. During 2023, we repurchased and cancelled a total of Class A Common Units at an average price of approximately per unit for a total purchase price of million, including commissions. We have not repurchased any Class A Common Units in 2024.

 Class A Convertible Preferred Units 
 Our Class A Convertible Preferred Units rank senior to all of our currently outstanding classes or series of limited partner interests with respect to distribution and/or liquidation rights. Holders of our Class A Convertible Preferred Units vote on an as-converted basis with holders of our common units and have certain class voting rights, including with respect to any amendment to the partnership agreement that would adversely affect the rights, preferences or privileges, or otherwise modify the terms, of those Class A Convertible Preferred Units. 
 Accounting for the Class A Convertible Preferred Units 
 Our Class A Convertible Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities under GAAP due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event that is outside of our control. Therefore, we present them as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We initially recognized our Class A Convertible Preferred Units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs, as they were not redeemable and we did not have plans or expect any events that constitute a change of control in our partnership agreement. 
 On April 3, 2023 and July 3, 2023, we entered into purchase agreements with the Class A Convertible Preferred unitholders whereby we redeemed a total of Class A Convertible Preferred Units (the Redeemed Units at an average purchase price of per unit. The Redeemed Units had a carrying value of per unit resulting in returns attributable to the Class A Convertible Preferred Units 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. is adjusted for distributions and returns attributable to the Class A Convertible Preferred Units that accumulate in the period to arrive at Net Income (Loss) attributable to Common Unitholders. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. was reduced by million and million for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2023 , respectively, due to Class A Convertible Preferred Unit distributions paid in the period (Class A Convertible Preferred Unit distributions are summarized in the table below). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Genesis Energy L.P. was increased by million and million , respectively, due to returns attributable to the Class A Convertible Preferred Units accumulated in the period. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we will not be required to further adjust the carrying amount of our Class A Convertible Preferred Units until it becomes probable that they would become redeemable. Once redemption becomes probable, we would adjust the carrying amount of our Class A Convertible Preferred Units to the redemption value over a period of time comprising the date redemption first becomes probable and the date the units can first be redeemed.

 Unrealized gains are subtracted from net income (loss) and unrealized losses are added to net income (loss) in determining cash flows from operating activities. To the extent that we have fair value hedges outstanding, the offsetting change recorded in the fair value of inventory is also eliminated from net income (loss) in determining cash flows from operating activities. Changes in the cash margin balance required to maintain our exchange-traded derivative contracts also affect cash flows from operating activities.

 Overview 
 We reported Net Loss Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of 17.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Quarter compared to Net Income Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of 58.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Quarter ). 
 Net Loss Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. in the 2024 Quarter was impacted by: (i) a decrease in operating income associated with our reportable segments primarily due to a decrease in export pricing in our Alkali Business and a decrease in volumes in our offshore pipeline transportation segment in the 2024 Quarter (see Results of Operations below for additional details on the results of our operating segments); (ii) an increase in interest expense, net, of 10.4 million (see Results of Operations below for additional details); and (iii) an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization of 13.5 million during the 2024 Quarter (see Results of Operations below for additional details). These impacts were partially offset by higher day rates in our marine transportation segment and higher soda ash sales volumes in our Alkali Business. 
 Cash flow from operating activities was 87.3 million for the 2024 Quarter compared to 141.0 million for the 2023 Quarter. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities is primarily attributable to the decrease in our reported Segment Margin (as discussed further below). 
 Available Cash before Reserves (as defined below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures to our common unitholders was 24.5 million for the 2024 Quarter, a decrease of 64.5 million, or 72 , from the 2023 Quarter primarily as a result of: (i) a decrease in Segment Margin of 56.8 million, which is discussed in more detail below; and (ii) an increase in interest expense, net, of 10.4 million (see Results of Operations below for additional details). 
 Segment Margin (as defined below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures was 151.1 million for the 2024 Quarter, a decrease of 56.8 million, or 27 , from the 2023 Quarter. A more detailed discussion of our segment results and other costs are included below in Results of Operations. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for additional information on Segment Margin. 
 Distribution to Unitholders 
 On August 14, 2024, we paid a distribution of 0.15 per common unit related to the second quarter of 2024. With respect to our Class A Convertible Preferred Units, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of 0.9473 per preferred unit (or 3.7892 on an annualized basis) for each preferred unit held of record. These distributions were paid on August 14, 2024 to unitholders holders of record at the close of business July 31, 2024. 
 In October 2024, we declared our quarterly distribution to our common unitholders of 0.165 per unit related to the 2024 Quarter. With respect to our Class A Convertible Preferred Units, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of 0.9473 per Class A Convertible Preferred Unit (or 3.7892 on an annualized basis) for each Class A Convertible Preferred Unit held of record. These distributions will be payable November 14, 2024 to unitholders of record at the close of business on October 31, 2024.

 International Conflicts and Market Update 
 Management s estimates are based on numerous assumptions about future operations and market conditions, which we believe to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. The uncertainties underlying our assumptions could cause our estimates to differ significantly from actual results, including with respect to the duration and severity of the lasting impacts of international conflicts and the result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future as a result of or as it relates to changes in governmental policies aimed at addressing inflation, which could cause fluctuations in global economic conditions, including capital and credit markets. We will continue to monitor the current market environment and to the extent conditions deteriorate, we may identify triggering events that may require future evaluations of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, which could result in impairment charges that could be material to our results of operations. 
 Although the ultimate impacts of these international conflicts, and fluctuations in global economic conditions, including capital and credit markets, are still unknown at this time, we believe the fundamentals of our core businesses continue to remain strong and, given the current industry environment and capital market behavior, we have continued our focus on increasing liquidity and completing our major growth capital projects in order to generate future cash flows to deleverage our balance sheet as further explained in Liquidity and Capital Resources .

 Results of Operations 
 Revenues and Costs and Expenses 
 Our revenues for the 2024 Quarter decreased 93.3 million, or 12 , from the 2023 Quarter and our total costs and expenses decreased 31.8 million, or 5 , between the two periods with an overall net decrease to operating income of 61.5 million as presented on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease in our operating income during the 2024 Quarter is primarily due to: (i) lower export pricing in our Alkali Business in the 2024 Quarter; (ii) lower volumes on our offshore pipelines due to producer underperformance as a result of mechanical issues on certain wells; and (iii) an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization. These decreases were partially offset by higher day rates in our marine transportation segment and higher soda ash sales volumes in our Alkali Business. See further discussion below under Segment Margin regarding the activity in our individual operating segments. 
 A substantial portion of our revenues and costs are derived from our Alkali Business, which is included in our soda and sulfur services segment, and the purchase and sale of crude oil in our crude oil marketing business, which is included in our onshore facilities and transportation segment. We describe, in more detail, the impact on revenues and costs for each of our businesses below. 
 As it relates to our Alkali Business, our revenues are derived from the extraction of trona, as well as the activities surrounding the processing and sale of natural soda ash and other alkali specialty products, including sodium sesquicarbonate (S-Carb) and sodium bicarbonate (Bicarb), and are a function of our selling prices and volumes sold. We sell our products to an industry-diverse and worldwide customer base. Our sales prices are contracted at various times throughout the year and for different durations. Our sales prices for volumes sold internationally are contracted for the current year either annually in the prior year or periodically throughout the current year (often quarterly), and our volumes priced and sold domestically are contracted at various times and can be of varying durations, often multi-year terms. The majority of our volumes sold internationally are sold through ANSAC, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of our Alkali Business on January 1, 2023 as we became the sole member of it at that time. ANSAC promotes export sales of U.S. produced soda ash utilizing its logistical asset and marketing capabilities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to the volumes supplied by our operations and sold by ANSAC, ANSAC continued to receive a level of soda ash supply from certain former members to sell internationally, which is expected to continue in some capacity for at least the next several years. As a result of consolidating the results of ANSAC beginning on January 1, 2023, the sale of the soda ash volumes by ANSAC that were supplied by non-members are included in our consolidated results and have a proportionate effect to our revenues and costs, with little to no direct impact to our reported Net income (loss), Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. We will continue to report the sales volumes of soda ash included in the operating results table for our soda and sulfur services segment shown below as we have historically reported them for comparability purposes and due to the minimal impact these incremental sales volumes from ANSAC have on our reported Net income (loss), Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. Our sales volumes and prices can fluctuate from period to period and are dependent upon many factors, of which the main drivers are the global market and supply, customer demand, economic growth, and our ability to produce soda ash. Positive or negative changes to our revenue, through fluctuations in sales volumes or sales prices, can have a direct impact to Net income (loss), Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves as these fluctuations have a lesser impact to operating costs due to the fact that a portion of our costs are fixed in nature. Our costs, some of which are variable in nature and others are fixed in nature, relate primarily to the processing and producing of soda ash (and other alkali specialty products) and marketing, logistics and selling activities. In addition, costs include activities associated with mining and extracting trona ore, including energy costs and employee compensation. In our Alkali Business, during the 2024 Quarter, we experienced a decrease in revenues relative to the 2023 Quarter primarily due to lower pricing on our export tons, which was partially offset by higher volumes sold and higher domestic pricing. For additional information, see our segment-by-segment analysis below. 
 As it relates to our crude oil marketing business, the average closing price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX decreased to 76.43 per barrel in the 2024 Quarter, as compared to 82.25 per barrel in the 2023 Quarter. We expect changes in crude oil prices to continue to proportionately affect our revenues and costs attributable to our purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products, resulting in a minimal direct impact on Net income (loss), Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. We have limited our direct commodity price exposure related to crude oil and petroleum products through the broad use of fee-based service contracts, back-to-back purchase and sale arrangements and hedges. As a result, changes in the price of crude oil would proportionately impact both our revenues and our costs, with a disproportionately smaller impact on Net income (loss), Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. However, we do have some indirect exposure to certain changes in prices for oil and petroleum products, particularly if they are significant and extended. We tend to experience more demand for certain of our services when prices increase significantly over extended periods of time, and we tend to experience less demand for certain of our services when prices decrease significantly over extended periods of time. For additional information regarding certain of our indirect exposure to commodity prices, see our segment-by-segment analysis below and the section of our Annual Report entitled Risks Related to Our Business.

 In addition to our Alkali Business and our crude oil marketing business discussed above, we continue to operate in our other core businesses including: (i) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, which is focused on providing a suite of services primarily to integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of a billion dollars) to develop large reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii) our sulfur services business, which we believe is one of the largest producers and marketers (based on tons produced) of NaHS in North and South America; and (iii) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations (including the operations in both our onshore facilities and transportation and marine transportation segments) which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners. 
 Refiners are the shippers of a majority o f the volumes transported on our onshore crude pipelines, and refiners contracted for approximately 90 of the revenues from our marine transportation segment during the 2024 Quarter, which are used primarily to transport intermediate refined products (not crude oil) between ref ining complexes. The shippers on our offshore pipelines are mostly integrated and large independent energy companies whose production is ideally suited for the vast majority of refineries along the Gulf Coast. Their large-reservoir properties and the related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive and yet, we believe, economically viable, in most cases, even in volatile commodity price environments. Given these facts, we do not expect changes in commodity prices to impact our Net income (loss), Segment Margin or Available Cash before Reserves derived from our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations in the same manner in which they impact our revenues and costs derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products. 
 In our sulfur services business, our revenues and costs can be affected by the price movements in both caustic soda and NaHS. Average index prices for caustic soda decreased to 502 per dry short ton DST during the 2024 Quarter compared to 992 per DST during the 2023 Quarter primarily due to a downward non-market adjustment of 425 per DST to previously posted U.S. Caustic Soda Index prices. Typically, changes in caustic soda prices do not materially affect Net income (loss), Segment Margin, or Available Cash before Reserves as the pricing in many of our sales contracts for NaHS typically includes adjustments for fluctuations in commodity benchmarks (primarily caustic soda), freight, labor, energy costs and government indexes. The frequency at which those adjustments are applied varies by contract, geographic region and supply point. The mix of NaHS sales volumes to which we are able to apply such adjustments may vary due to timing or other factors such as competitive pressures. To the extent we are unable to pass these caustic soda price changes onto our customers, our results may be impacted. 
 Additionally, changes in certain of our operating costs between the respective quarters, such as those associated with our soda and sulfur services, offshore pipeline transportation and marine transportation segments, are not correlated with crude oil prices. We discuss certain of those costs in further detail below in our segment-by-segment analysis.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Offshore pipeline transportation Segment Margin for the 2024 Quarter decreased 37.1 million, or 34 , from the 2023 Quarter primarily due to several factors including: (i) an economic step-down in the rate on a certain existing life-of-lease transportation dedication; (ii) producer underperformance at two of our major host platforms; and (iii) an increase in our operating costs. At the beginning of the 2024 Quarter, we reached the 10-year anniversary of a certain existing life-of-lease transportation dedication, which resulted in the contractual economic step-down of the associated transportation rate. In addition, there was an increase in producer downtime relative to the 2023 Quarter as a result of certain sub-sea operational and technical challenges at fields connected to two of our major host platforms. The production from these wells impacted our results as they are molecules that we touch multiple times throughout our oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure. We anticipate that the operational and technical issues that were experienced in the 2024 Quarter will be resolved by the end of this year. Outside of these issues, activity in and around our Gulf of Mexico asset base continues to be robust, including incremental in-field drilling at existing fields that tie into our infrastructure. This activity is evidenced by projects such as the Warrior and Winterfell projects, which produced first oil in late June 2024 and early July 2024, respectively, and the Monument development which is currently expected to come on-line in mid to late 2026. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Offshore pipeline transportation Segment Margin for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 44.4 million, or 15 , from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to several factors including: (i) an economic step-down in the rate on a certain existing life-of-lease transportation dedication during the 2024 Quarter; (ii) producer underperformance at two of our major host platforms; and (iii) an increase in our operating costs. During the 2024 Quarter, we reached the 10-year anniversary of a certain existing life-of-lease transportation dedication, which resulted in the contractual economic step-down of the associated transportation rate. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, there was an increase in producer downtime as a result of several wells being shut in due to certain sub-sea operational and technical challenges, which extended through the 2024 Quarter due to delays in well intervention work. The production from these wells impacted our results as they are molecules that we touch multiple times throughout our oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure. 
 These decreases were partially offset by an increase in volumes during the first nine months of 2024 on our CHOPS pipeline primarily due to the Argos Floating Production System FPS ). The Argos FPS has continued to ramp up production levels and achieved production levels in excess of 120,000 barrels of oil per day in 2024. Activity in and around our Gulf of Mexico asset base continues to be robust, including incremental in-field drilling at existing fields that tie into our infrastructure. This activity is evidenced by projects such as the Warrior and Winterfell projects, which produced first oil in late June 2024 and early July 2024, respectively, and the Monument development which is currently expected to come on-line in mid to late 2026.

 (1) See discussion above in Results of Operations Revenues and Costs and Expenses regarding revenues associated with our Alkali Business. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Soda and sulfur services Segment Margin for the 2024 Quarter decreased 23.8 million, or 38 , from the 2023 Quarter primarily due to lower export pricing in our Alkali Business during the 2024 Quarter and lower NaHS and caustic soda sales volumes and sales pricing, which was partially offset by higher soda ash sales volumes in the period. 
 In our Alkali Business, the 2024 Quarter was impacted by a decline in export pricing as compared to the 2023 Quarter as global supply has continued to outpace demand in most markets. Additionally, the 2024 Quarter was negatively impacted by temporary operational issues at our Westvaco facility that led to lower production volumes and reduced operating efficiencies. Despite these operational issues, our Alkali Business experienced higher soda ash sales volumes in the 2024 Quarter as production from our expanded Granger facility came online in the fourth quarter of 2023 and has since ramped up to levels near its nameplate capacity of approximately 100,000 tons of production per month. 
 In our sulfur services business, we have experienced continued pressure on demand in South America, which has negatively impacted NaHS and caustic soda sales volumes and pricing. In addition, production was impacted by a planned outage at one of our largest and lowest cost host refineries during the 2024 Quarter. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Soda and sulfur services Segment Margin for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 92.1 million, or 42 , from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to lower export pricing in our Alkali Business and lower NaHS and caustic soda sales pricing. 
 In our Alkali Business, the first nine months of 2024 were impacted by a decline in export pricing as compared to the first nine months of 2023 as global supply has continued to outpace demand in most markets. Additionally, the first nine months of 2024 was negatively impacted by temporary operational issues at our facilities that led to lower production volumes and reduced operating efficiencies during the period. These were offset partially by higher soda ash sales volumes in the first nine months of 2024 as production from our expanded Granger facility came online in the fourth quarter of 2023 and has since ramped up to levels near its original nameplate production capacity of approximately 100,000 tons per month. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, we experienced extreme winter weather conditions that impacted our operations and certain supply functions, including rail service in and out of the Green River Basin. 
 In our sulfur services business, we have experienced continued pressure on demand in South America, which has negatively impacted NaHS and caustic soda sales pricing.

 Marine Transportation Segment 
 Within our marine transportation segment, we own a fleet of 87 barges (78 inland and 9 offshore) with a combined transportation capacity of 3.0 million barrels, 42 push/tow boats (33 inland and 9 offshore), and a 330,000 barrel capacity ocean going tanker, the M/T American Phoenix. Operating results for our marine transportation segment were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues (in thousands): Inland freight revenues 36,632 30,974 110,127 94,067 Offshore freight revenues 26,925 29,459 80,275 83,341 Other rebill revenues (1)

 (2) Utilization rates are based on a 365-day year, as adjusted for planned downtime and dry-docking. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Marine transportation Segment Margin for the 2024 Quarter increased 3.9 million, or 15 , from the 2023 Quarter primarily due to higher day rates in our inland and offshore businesses, including the M/T American Phoenix, during the 2024 Quarter. The increase in day rates more than offset the impact to Segment Margin from the increased number of regulatory dry-docking days in our offshore fleet during the 2024 Quarter. Demand for our barge services to move intermediate and refined products remained high during the 2024 Quarter due to the continued strength of refinery utilization rates as well as the lack of new supply of similar type vessels (primarily due to higher construction costs and long lead times for construction) as well as the retirement of older vessels in the market. We expect this favorable demand and supply balance to continue throughout the rest of 2024. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Marine transportation Segment Margin for the first nine months of 2024 increased 15.4 million, or 20 , from the first nine months of 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in overall day rates in our inland and offshore businesses, including the M/T American Phoenix. The increase in day rates more than offset the impact to Segment Margin from the increased number of regulatory dry-docking days in our offshore fleet during the first nine months of 2024. In addition, we have continued to see strong demand for our barge services to move intermediate and refined products keeping utilization rates high across both periods. The strong demand from our customers as well as the lack of new supply of similar type vessels and the retirement of older vessels in the market have contributed the increase in day rates discussed above. The M/T American Phoenix started a new three-and-a-half-year contract in January 2024 with a credit-worthy counterparty at the highest day rate we have received since we first purchased the vessel in 2014.

 Onshore Facilities and Transportation Segment 
 Our onshore facilities and transportation segment utilizes an integrated set of pipelines and terminals, trucks and barges to facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products on behalf of producers, refiners and other customers. This segment includes crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminals and rail unloading facilities operating primarily within the U.S. Gulf Coast crude oil market. In addition, we utilize our trucking fleet that supports the purchase and sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil. Through these assets we offer our customers a full suite of services, including the following as of September 30, 2024: 
 facilitating the transportation of crude oil from producers to refineries and from our terminals, as well as those owned by third parties, to refiners via pipelines; 
 shipping crude oil and refined products to and from producers and refiners via trucks and pipelines; 
 storing and blending of crude oil and intermediate and finished refined products; 
 purchasing/selling and/or transporting crude oil from the wellhead to markets for ultimate use in refining; 
 purchasing products from refiners, transporting those products to one of our terminals and blending those products to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers and selling those products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products) to wholesale markets; and 
 unloading railcars at our crude-by-rail terminals. 
 We also may use our terminal facilities to take advantage of contango market conditions for crude oil gathering and marketing and to capitalize on regional opportunities which arise from time to time for both crude oil and petroleum products. 
 Despite crude oil being considered a somewhat homogeneous commodity, many refiners are very particular about the quality of crude oil feedstock they process. Many U.S. refineries have distinct configurations and product slates that require crude oil with specific characteristics, such as gravity, sulfur content and metals content. The refineries evaluate the costs to obtain, transport and process their preferred feedstocks. That particularity provides us with opportunities to help the refineries in our areas of operation identify crude oil sources and transport crude oil meeting their requirements. The imbalances and inefficiencies relative to meeting the refiners requirements may also provide opportunities for us to utilize our purchasing and logistical skills to meet their demands. The pricing in the majority of our crude oil purchase contracts contains a market price component and a deduction to cover the cost of transportation and to provide us with a margin. Contracts sometimes contain a grade differential which considers the chemical composition of the crude oil and its appeal to different customers. Typically, the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price components and the grade differentials. The margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs and to capitalize on grade differentials.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Interest expense, net for the 2024 Quarter increased by 10.4 million primarily due to an increase in interest on our senior unsecured notes. The increase in interest expense associated with our senior unsecured notes was primarily related to: (i) the issuance of our 8.25 senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2029 (the 2029 Notes in December 2023, which have a higher principal and interest rate as compared to our 6.50 senior unsecured notes due October 1, 2025 (the 2025 Notes that were partially tendered in December 2023 and ultimately redeemed in January 2024; and (ii) the issuance of our 2032 Notes in May 2024, which have a higher principal and interest rate as compared to our 2026 Notes that were redeemed in June 2024. 
 These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest during the 2024 Quarter as a result of our increased capital expenditures associated with our offshore growth capital construction projects. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Interest expense, net for the first nine months of 2024 increased 27.5 million primarily due to an increase in interest on our senior secured credit facility and an increase in interest on our senior unsecured notes. The increase in interest expense associated with our senior secured credit facility is primarily due to a higher average outstanding indebtedness during the first nine months of 2024 and an increase in the SOFR rate, which is one of the main components of our interest rate, compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in interest expense associated with our senior unsecured notes was primarily related to: (i) the issuance of our 2029 Notes in December 2023, which have a higher principal and interest rate as compared to our 2025 Notes that were partially tendered in December 2023 and ultimately redeemed in January 2024; and (ii) the issuance of our 2032 Notes in May 2024, which have a higher principal and interest rate as compared to our 2026 Notes that were redeemed in June 2024. 
 These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest during the first nine months of 2024 as a result of our increased capital expenditures associated with our offshore growth capital construction projects. 
 Income tax expense 
 A portion of our operations are owned by wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries that are taxable as corporations. As a result, a substantial portion of the income tax expense we record relates to the operations of those corporations, and will vary from period to period as a percentage of our income before taxes based on the percentage of our income or loss that is derived from those corporations. The balance of the income tax expense we record relates to state taxes imposed on our operations that are treated as income taxes under generally accepted accounting principles and foreign income taxes.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 On December 7, 2023, we issued 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes, which generated net proceeds of approximately 583 million, after deducting the underwriters discount and issuance costs incurred. The net proceeds were used to purchase approximately 514 million of the 2025 Notes and pay the related accrued interest and tender premium and fees on those notes that were tendered in the tender offer that ended December 6, 2023. On December 8, 2023, we issued a notice of redemption for the remaining principal of approximately 21 million of our 2025 Notes, and discharged the indebtedness with respect to the 2025 Notes on December 28, 2023 by depositing the redemption amount with the trustee of the 2025 Notes for redemption of the 2025 Notes, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of the indenture governing the 2025 Notes. 
 On May 9, 2024, we issued 700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Notes. The issuance of our 2032 Notes generated net proceeds of approximately 688 million, net of issuance costs incurred. The net proceeds were used to redeem all of our existing 2026 Notes, 339.3 million in principal amount of which were outstanding, including the related accrued interest, and the remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of the borrowing outstanding under our senior secured credit facility and for general partnership purposes. 
 On July 19, 2024, we entered into our credit agreement to replace our Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Our credit agreement provides for a 900 million senior secured revolving credit facility that matures on September 1, 2028, subject to extension at our request for one additional year on up to two occasions and subject to certain conditions, unless: (i) if more than 150 million of our 2027 Notes remain outstanding as of October 16, 2026, the credit agreement matures on such date; and (ii) if more than 150 million of our 2028 Notes remain outstanding as of November 2, 2027, the credit agreement matures on such date. 
 The successful completion of our credit agreement (including its extended maturity and increased borrowing capacity), and the refinancing of our previously held 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes has extended our maturity runway, and has provided us an ample amount of available borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility, subject to compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement, to, amongst other things, utilize for funding the remaining growth capital expenditures estimated to be associated with our offshore growth projects discussed below under Growth Capital Expenditures . 
 We anticipate that our future internally-generated funds and the funds available under our senior secured credit facility will allow us to meet our ordinary course capital needs. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, borrowing availability under our senior secured credit facility, proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, the creation of strategic arrangements to share capital costs through joint ventures or strategic alliances and the proceeds from issuances of equity (common and preferred) and senior unsecured or secured notes. 
 Our primary cash requirements consist of: 
 working capital, primarily inventories and trade receivables and payables; 
 routine operating expenses; 
 growth capital (as discussed in more detail below) and maintenance projects; 
 interest payments related to outstanding debt; 
 asset retirement obligations; 
 quarterly cash distributions to our preferred and common unitholders; and 
 acquisitions of assets or businesses. 
 Capital Resources 
 Our ability to satisfy future capital needs will depend on our ability to raise substantial amounts of additional capital from time to time, including through equity and debt offerings (public and private), borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and other financing transactions, and to implement our growth strategy successfully. No assurance can be made that we will be able to raise necessary funds on satisfactory terms. 
 At September 30, 2024, our principal amount of debt outstanding totaled approximately 4.1 billion, consisting of 207.6 million outstanding under our senior secured credit facility (including 24.2 million borrowed under the inventory sublimit tranche), 3.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and 416.3 million of Alkali senior secured notes (of which 12.7 million is current), which are secured by the ORRI Interests. Our senior unsecured notes balance is comprised of 981.2 million of our 2027 Notes, 679.4 million of our 2028 Notes, 600.0 million of our 2029 Notes, 500.0 million of our 2030 Notes, and 700.0 million of our 2032 Notes.

 The available borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility at September 30, 2024 is 687.9 million, subject to compliance with covenants. Our credit agreement does not include a borrowing base limitation except with respect to our inventory loans. 
 Shelf Registration Statement 
 We have the ability to issue additional equity and debt securities in the future to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, particularly those related to opportunistically acquiring assets and businesses and constructing new facilities and refinancing outstanding debt. 
 We have a universal shelf registration statement (our 2024 Shelf on file with the SEC which we filed on April 16, 2024 to replace our existing universal shelf registration statement that expired on April 19, 2024. Our 2024 Shelf allows us to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities in connection with certain types of public offerings. However, the receptiveness of the capital markets to an offering of equity and/or debt securities cannot be assured and may be negatively impacted by, among other things, our long-term business prospects and other factors beyond our control, including market conditions. Our 2024 Shelf is set to expire in April 2027. 
 Cash Flows from Operations 
 We generally utilize the cash flows we generate from our operations to fund our common and preferred distributions and working capital needs. Excess funds that are generated are used to repay borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and/or to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. Our operating cash flows can be impacted by changes in items of working capital, primarily variances in the carrying amount of inventory and the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures and interest charges, and the timing of accounts receivable collections from our customers. 
 We typically sell our crude oil in the same month in which we purchase it, so we do not need to rely on borrowings under our senior secured credit facility to pay for such crude oil purchases, other than inventory. During such periods, our accounts receivable and accounts payable generally move in tandem as we make payments and receive payments for the purchase and sale of crude oil. 
 In our Alkali Business, we typically extract trona from our mining facilities, process it into soda ash and other alkali products, and deliver and sell the products to our customers domestically and internationally. When we experience any differences in timing between the extraction, processing and sales of this trona or Alkali products, including the logistics and transportation to our customers, this could impact the cash requirements for these activities. 
 The storage of our inventory of crude oil, petroleum products and alkali products can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities. In the month we pay for the stored crude oil or petroleum products (or pay for extraction and processing activities in the case of alkali products), we borrow under our senior secured credit facility (or use cash on hand) to pay for the crude oil or petroleum products (or extraction/processing of alkali products), utilizing a portion of our operating cash flows. Conversely, cash flow from operating activities increases during the period in which we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil, petroleum products or alkali products. Additionally, for our exchange-traded derivatives, we may be required to deposit margin funds with the respective exchange when commodity prices increase as the value of the derivatives utilized to hedge the price risk in our inventory fluctuates. These deposits also impact our operating cash flows as we borrow under our senior secured credit facility or use cash on hand to fund the deposits. 
 See Note 15 in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding changes in components of operating assets and liabilities during the first nine months of 2024 and the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net cash flows provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 318.0 million compared to 396.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in our reported Segment Margin in the first nine months of 2024 relative to Segment Margin in the first nine months of 2023, which was partially offset by positive changes in working capital for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Capital Expenditures and Distributions Paid to Our Unitholders 
 We use cash primarily for our operating expenses, working capital needs, debt service, acquisition activities, internal growth projects and distributions we pay to our common and preferred unitholders. We finance maintenance capital expenditures and smaller internal growth projects and distributions primarily with cash generated by our operations. We have historically funded material growth capital projects (including acquisitions and internal growth projects) with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, equity issuances (common and preferred units), the issuance of senior unsecured or secured notes, and/or the creation of strategic arrangements to share capital costs through joint ventures or strategic alliances.

 (1) Growth capital expenditures in our offshore pipeline transportation segment for 2024 and 2023 represent 100 of the costs incurred, including those funded by our noncontrolling interest holder (see further discussion below in Growth Capital Expenditures ). 
 Growth Capital Expenditures 
 On September 23, 2019, we announced the Granger Optimization Project GOP ). During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed the construction of the GOP and achieved first production. 
 During 2022, we entered into definitive agreements to provide transportation services for 100 of the crude oil production associated with two separate standalone deepwater developments that have a combined production capacity of approximately 160,000 barrels per day. In conjunction with these agreements, we are expanding the current capacity of our 64 owned CHOPS pipeline and constructing a new 100 owned, approximately 105 mile, 20 diameter crude oil pipeline, the SYNC pipeline, to connect one of the developments to our existing asset footprint in the Gulf of Mexico. We plan to be ready for the producers plan for first oil achievement, which is currently expected in the second quarter of 2025. Additionally, in 2023 and 2024, we entered into several additional definitive agreements with existing producers to further commit additional volumes transported on our offshore pipeline infrastructure. The producer agreements include long term take-or-pay arrangements and, accordingly, we are able to receive a project completion credit for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio under our credit agreement throughout the construction period. 
 We plan to fund our estimated growth capital expenditures utilizing the available borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility and our recurring cash flows generated from operations. 
 Maintenance Capital Expenditures 
 Maintenance capital expenditures incurred during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 primarily related to expenditures in our marine transportation segment to replace and upgrade certain equipment associated with our barge and fleet vessels during our planned and unplanned dry-docks and in our Alkali Business due to the costs to maintain our related equipment and facilities. Additionally, our offshore transportation assets require maintenance capital expenditures to replace, maintain and upgrade equipment at certain of our offshore platforms and pipelines that we operate. See further discussion under Available Cash before Reserves for how such maintenance capital utilization is reflected in our calculation of Available Cash before Reserves.

These distributions will be payable on November 14, 2024 to unitholders of record at the close of business on October 31, 2024. 
 
 Guarantor Summarized Financial Information 
 Our 3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes co-issued by Genesis Energy, L.P. and Genesis Energy Finance Corporation are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by the Guarantor Subsidiaries, except GA ORRI and GA ORRI Holdings and certain other subsidiaries. The remaining non-guarantor subsidiaries are indirectly owned by Genesis Crude Oil, L.P., a Guarantor Subsidiary. The Guarantor Subsidiaries largely own the assets that we use to operate our business. As a general rule, the assets and credit of our unrestricted subsidiaries are not available to satisfy the debts of Genesis Energy, L.P., Genesis Energy Finance Corporation or the Guarantor Subsidiaries, and the liabilities of our unrestricted subsidiaries do not constitute obligations of Genesis Energy, L.P., Genesis Energy Finance Corporation or the Guarantor Subsidiaries. See Note 10 in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations. 
 The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor Subsidiary and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future senior indebtedness of such Guarantor Subsidiary, and senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor Subsidiary. The guarantee of our senior unsecured notes by each Guarantor Subsidiary is subject to certain automatic customary releases, including in connection with the sale, disposition or transfer of all of the capital stock, or of all or substantially all of the assets, of such Guarantor Subsidiary to one or more persons that are not us or a restricted subsidiary, the exercise of legal defeasance or covenant defeasance options, the satisfaction and discharge of the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, the designation of such Guarantor Subsidiary as a non-Guarantor Subsidiary or as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, the release of such Guarantor Subsidiary from its guarantee under our senior secured credit facility, or liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor Subsidiary (collectively, the Releases ). The obligations of each Guarantor Subsidiary under its note guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent such note guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. We are not restricted from making investments in the Guarantor Subsidiaries and there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to make distributions to Genesis Energy, L.P. 
 The rights of holders of our senior unsecured notes against the Guarantor Subsidiaries may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. 
 The following is the summarized financial information for Genesis Energy, L.P. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions among the Guarantor Subsidiaries (which includes related receivable and payable balances) and the investment in and equity earnings from the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 General 
 To help evaluate our business, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes the non-generally accepted accounting principle non-GAAP financial measure of Available Cash before Reserves. We also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The schedules above provide reconciliations of Available Cash before Reserves to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). A reconciliation of Net Income (loss) attributable Genesis Energy, L.P. to total Segment Margin is included in our segment disclosure in Note 13 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as previously in this Item 2. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves and total Segment Margin measures are just two of the relevant data points considered from time to time. 
 When evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team have access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance; liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow expectations for us; and certain information regarding some of our peers. Additionally, our board of directors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user.

 Segment Margin 
 We define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses, and segment general and administrative expenses (all of which are net of the effects of our noncontrolling interest holders), plus or minus applicable Select Items (defined below). Although we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes where relevant and capital investment. 
 A reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. to total Segment Margin is included in our segment disclosure in Note 13 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as previously in this Item 2. 
 Available Cash before Reserves 
 Purposes, Uses and Definition 
 Available Cash before Reserves, often referred to by others as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things: 
 (1) the financial performance of our assets; 
 (2) our operating performance; 
 (3) the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry; 
 (4) the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and 
 (5) our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our preferred and common units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness. 
 Disclosure Format Relating to Maintenance Capital 
 We use a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because our maintenance capital expenditures vary materially in nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount from time to time. We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. 
 Maintenance Capital Requirements 
 Maintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances. 
 Prior to 2014, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures were (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible. An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement. 
 Beginning with 2014, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time have been and will continue to be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them. We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not to make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses. 
 In summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management s increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures, distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we believe is more useful in the determination of Available Cash before Reserves. 
 Maintenance Capital Utilized 
 We believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We define our maintenance capital utilized measure as that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter, which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projects/components. 
 Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. Because we did not initially use our maintenance capital utilized measure before 2014, our maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no new or material changes to the critical accounting estimates discussed in our Annual Report that are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company. 
 Forward Looking Statements
