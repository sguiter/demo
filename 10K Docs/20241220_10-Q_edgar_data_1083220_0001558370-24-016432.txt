 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (which included non-cash expenses of approximately million and a million non-cash gain on the divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand), and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of September 30, 2024.

 Summary of Operating Results Three months ended September 30, 2024 (the current quarter compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the prior year quarter Revenues Current quarter net revenue decreased 0.73 million to 1.91 million from 2.64 million for the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.87 million reduction in net licensing revenue, which declined from 2.38 million in the prior year quarter to 1.51 million in the current quarter, and was mainly driven by the June 30, 2024 divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand, partially offset by increased licensing revenues generated by our other brands. In the current quarter, we recognized 0.41 million of net product sales from the sale of all remaining inventory of the Longaberger Brand to a third party at cost. As of September 30, 2024, we had no remaining inventory. Prior year quarter net product sales of 0.26 million represent the direct-to-consumer sales operations related to the Longaberger Brand, prior to our outsourcing of that business in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of Goods Sold Current quarter cost of goods sold was 0.41 million, as we sold all remaining inventory related to the Longaberger Brand to a third party during the current quarter, at cost. Direct Operating Costs and Expenses Direct operating costs and expenses decreased approximately 2.79 million, from 5.62 million in the prior year quarter to 2.83 million in the current quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to the 2023 restructuring and transformation of our business operating model, along with additional cost reduction actions taken by management in the current year, which have significantly reduced the Company s payroll, operating, and overhead costs. As of the third quarter of 2024, the Company has reduced its direct operating expenses to a current run rate of approximately 11 million per annum.

Table of Contents 
 Other Operating Costs and Expenses (Income) Depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 0.77 million, from 1.68 million in the prior year quarter to 0.91 million in the current quarter. This decrease is primarily attributable to the June 30, 2024 divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand, which included trademarks related to that brand with a net book value of approximately 1.93 million at the time of the divestiture. We recognized equity method losses related to our equity investments in unconsolidated affiliates (IM Topco, LLC and Orme Live Inc.) of 0.59 million and 0.52 million for the current quarter and prior year quarter, respectively, due to the operations of those businesses and the distribution provisions applicable to each. The equity method losses for each quarter related to IM Topco, LLC consisted of 0.52 million of amortization expense of the Isaac Mizrahi intellectual property assets. We also recognized a 6.25 million non-cash charge in the current quarter to recognize the estimated value of our contingent obligation to transfer a portion of our equity ownership interests in IM Topco, LLC to WHP after March 31, 2025. This charge essentially represents a subsequent reduction of the previously-recognized gain from the 2022 sale of a majority interest in the Isaac Mizrahi Brand. Income Taxes The estimated annual effective income tax rate for the current quarter and the prior year quarter was approximately 0 for both periods, resulting in an income tax benefit of 0 for both periods. For both periods, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to the recording of a valuation allowance against the benefit that would have otherwise been recognized, as it was considered not more likely than not that the net operating losses generated during each period will be utilized in future periods. Net Loss Attributable to Xcel Brands, Inc. Stockholders We had a net loss of 9.21 million for the current quarter, compared with a net loss of 5.14 million for the prior year quarter, due to the combination of the factors outlined above. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA We had a non-GAAP net loss of approximately 1.33 million, or 0.06 per diluted share non-GAAP diluted EPS ), for the current quarter and a non-GAAP net loss of 3.05 million, or 0.15 per diluted share, for the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is a non-GAAP unaudited term, which we define as net income (loss) attributable to Xcel Brands, Inc. stockholders, exclusive of amortization of trademarks, income (loss) from equity method investments, changes in ownership interests of equity method investments, stock-based compensation and cost of licensee warrants, gains on sales of assets and investments, gain on lease termination, asset impairment charges, and income taxes (if any). Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP diluted EPS measures do not include the tax effect of the aforementioned adjusting items, due to the nature of these items and the Company s tax strategy. We had Adjusted EBITDA of approximately (1.05) million for the current quarter, compared with approximately (1.41) million for the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP unaudited measure, which we define as net (loss) income attributable to Xcel Brands, Inc. stockholders before asset impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, income (loss) from equity method investments, changes in ownership interests of equity method investments, interest and finance expenses (including loss on extinguishment of debt, if any), accretion of lease liability for exited leases, income taxes (if any), other state and local franchise taxes, stock-based compensation and cost of licensee warrants, gains on sales of assets and investments, gain on lease termination, costs of restructuring of operations, and losses from discontinued businesses. Management uses non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to identify business trends

 relating to the Company s results of operations. Management believes non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA are also useful because these measures adjust for certain costs and other events that management believes are not representative of our core business operating results, and thus, these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental information to assist investors in evaluating the Company s financial results. Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, earnings per share, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Given that non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures not deemed to be in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, our non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry, because other companies may calculate non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner than we calculate these measures. In evaluating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may or may not incur expenses similar to some of the adjustments in this report. Our presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA does not imply that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any other unusual or non-recurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP results, and not rely on any single financial measure.

This decline was primarily attributable to the 7.90 million decrease in net product sales from 8.44 million in the prior year nine months to 0.54 million in the current nine months, due to the exit from our wholesale apparel and fine jewelry sales operations and outsourcing of our Longaberger business as part of the restructuring and transformation of our business operating model in 2023. The only net product sales in the current nine months were related to the final sale of certain residual jewelry inventories and the sale of all remaining inventory related to the Longaberger brand; as of September 30, 2024, the Company has no remaining inventory. Net licensing revenues also decreased, from 7.03 million in the prior year nine months to 6.52 million in the current nine months. This decline of approximately 0.51 million was primarily attributable to the June 30, 2024 divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand, partially offset by licensing revenues from the new licensing agreements with best-in-class business partners that we entered into in 2023, most notably the Halston Master License with G-III Apparel Group, as well as significantly increased revenues generated by the C Wonder by Christian Siriano business on HSN. Cost of Goods Sold Current nine months cost of goods sold was 0.45 million, compared with 6.72 million for the prior year nine months. This decrease was driven by the aforementioned exit from our wholesale and direct-to-consumer operations as part of the 2023 business model restructuring. Direct Operating Costs and Expenses Direct operating costs and expenses decreased approximately 7.86 million from 17.77 million in the prior year nine months to 9.91 million in the current nine months. This decrease was primarily attributable to the 2023 restructuring and transformation of our business operating model, which included reductions in staffing levels as well as related reductions in other overhead costs.

 Other Operating Costs and Expenses (Income) Depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 1.22 million, from 5.26 million in the prior year nine months to 4.04 million in the current nine months. This decrease is primarily attributable to the June 30, 2024 divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand, which included trademarks related to that brand with a net book value of approximately 1.93 million at the time of the divestiture. Equity method losses related to our equity investments in unconsolidated affiliates (IM Topco, LLC and Orme Live Inc.) were 1.68 million and 1.55 million for the current nine months and prior year nine months, respectively, due to the operations of those businesses and the distribution provisions applicable to each. The equity method losses for each nine-month period related to IM Topco, LLC consisted of 1.55 million of amortization expense of the Isaac Mizrahi intellectual property assets. We also recognized a 6.25 million non-cash charge in the current nine months to recognize the estimated value of our contingent obligation to transfer a portion of our equity ownership interests in IM Topco, LLC to WHP after March 31, 2025. This charge essentially represents a subsequent reduction of the previously-recognized gain from the 2022 sale of a majority interest in the Isaac Mizrahi Brand. During the current nine months, we recognized a 3.80 million gain on the divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand. The consideration received from this transaction was non-cash in nature, and consisted of approximately 6.08 million of relief from certain accrued earn-out payments and the release of contingent obligations under contractual agreements with the buyer. The net book value of the intangible assets sold was approximately 1.93 million, and we also incurred approximately 0.35 million of legal fees in connection with the sale. Also during the current nine months, we recognized asset impairment charges of approximately 3.48 million related to our exit from and sublease of our offices at 1333 Broadway, of which approximately 3.1 million related to the operating lease right-of-use asset and approximately 0.4 million related to leasehold improvements at that location. During the prior year nine months, we recognized a gain of 0.35 million related to the sale of a limited partner ownership interest in an unconsolidated affiliate, which was entered into in 2016, and a gain of 0.44 million related to a lease termination settlement with the landlord of our former retail store location. Income Taxes The estimated annual effective income tax rate for the current nine months and the prior year nine months was approximately 0 for both periods, resulting in an income tax benefit of 0 for both periods. For both periods, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to the recording of a valuation allowance against the benefit that would have otherwise been recognized, as it was considered not more likely than not that the net operating losses generated during each period will be utilized in future periods. Net Loss Attributable to Xcel Brands, Inc. Stockholders We had a net loss of 15.31 million for the current nine months, compared with a net loss of 14.26 million for the prior year nine months, due to the combination of the factors outlined above. Non-GAAP Net (Loss) Income, Non-GAAP Diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA We had a non-GAAP net loss of approximately 3.44 million, or 0.15 per diluted share for the current nine months and a non-GAAP net loss of 8.66 million, or 0.44 per diluted share, for the prior year nine months. We had Adjusted EBITDA of approximately (2.66) million for the current nine months, compared with approximately (4.57) million for the prior year nine months.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources General As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were 0.24 million and 3.00 million, respectively. Restricted cash at September 30, 2024 (included within other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet) consisted of 0.7 million of cash deposited with Israel Discount Bank of New York as collateral for a standby letter of credit associated with a real estate lease; there was no restricted cash as of December 31, 2023. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund working capital needs, acquire new brands, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures. Our current licensing plus operating model is a working capital light business model, and generally does not require material capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, we have no significant commitments for future capital expenditures. Working Capital Our working capital (current assets less current liabilities, excluding the current portion of operating lease obligations, deferred revenue, and any contingent obligations payable in common stock) was approximately negative 0.4 million and positive 2.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Post closing of the new term loan debt in December 2024 (as described further below), the Company s working capital increased by approximately 4.5 million. Liquidity and Management s Plans We incurred a net loss attributable to Company stockholders of approximately 15.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (which included non-cash expenses of approximately 15.8 million, and a non-cash gain of approximately 3.8 million on the divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand), and had an accumulated deficit of approximately 69.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These factors, along with our current levels of cash and working capital, raise uncertainties about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. During the year ended December 31, 2023, management implemented a plan to mitigate an expected shortfall of capital and to support future operations by shifting its business from a wholesale/licensing hybrid model into a licensing plus model. These restructuring initiatives included entering into various new licensing agreements and joint venture arrangements with best-in-class business partners, and reducing the Company s payroll, overhead, and other operating costs by approximately 15 million on an annualized basis when compared to 2022. During the first nine months of 2024, management took further actions to optimize its cost structure and manage its liquidity, including entering into a divestiture transaction (see Note 3 for details) which eliminated certain operating and compensation expenses, relieved the Company of its contractual obligations to make future cash payments of approximately 1 million, and relieved the Company of a potential future contingent obligation to make future cash payments of up to approximately 11 million. As of the third quarter of 2024, the Company has reduced its direct operating expenses to a current run rate of approximately 11 million per annum. Also during the first nine months of 2024, the Company issued new shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 2 million. Further, in December 2024, the Company entered into a new term loan agreement for the aggregate amount of 10 million. Based on the aforementioned events and changes, management expects that existing cash and future operating cash flows will be adequate to meet the Company s operating needs, term debt service obligations, and capital expenditure needs, for at least the twelve months subsequent to the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; therefore, such conditions and uncertainties with respect to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as of September 30, 2024 have been alleviated.

 Commentary on the components of our cash flows for the current nine months as compared with the prior year nine months is set forth below. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 3.31 million in the current nine months, compared with approximately 2.81 million in the prior year nine months. The current nine months net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the combination of the net loss of (15.40) million plus non-cash items of approximately 11.99 million and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 0.11 million. Non-cash items were primarily comprised of approximately 6.25 million for the change in value of contingent obligations, 4.04 million of depreciation and amortization expense, 3.48 million of asset impairment charges, and our 1.68 million undistributed proportional share of net losses from equity method investees, partially offset by a (3.80) million gain on the divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily comprised of decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of approximately 0.59 million and 0.45 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in lease-related assets and liabilities of (0.71) million. The prior year nine months cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the combination of the net loss of (15.04) million plus non-cash items of approximately 7.07 million and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 5.16 million. Non-cash items were primarily comprised of 5.26 million of depreciation and amortization expense, our 1.55 million undistributed proportional share of net loss of equity method investee, and a 0.76 million charge related to the restructuring of certain contractual arrangements, partially offset by a (0.35) gain on the sale of a financial asset and a (0.44) gain on the settlement of a lease liability. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily comprised of (i) an increase in deferred revenue of approximately 4.68 million, which was mainly attributable to the upfront payment received for the Halston Master License agreement entered into during the prior year nine months, (ii) a decrease in inventory of approximately 1.85 million, driven by the sale of all of our C Wonder apparel inventory to HSN and the sale of all of our Judith Ripka fine jewelry inventory to JTV, as part of the restructuring and transformation of our business operating model. Partially offsetting these net changes in operating assets and liabilities were decreases in various operating liabilities of approximately (1.40) million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in the current nine months was comprised of purchases of furniture and fixtures totaling approximately 0.11 million. Net cash provided by investing activities in the prior year nine months was approximately 0.36 million, primarily driven by 0.45 million of proceeds received from the sale of a limited partner ownership interest in an unconsolidated affiliate, which was entered into in 2016. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in the current nine months was primarily attributable to 1.90 million of net proceeds generated by equity issuance transactions undertaken during the first quarter (as described in more detail below), partially offset by 0.50 million of scheduled principal payments made on our term loan debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in the prior year nine months was entirely attributable to proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in the amount of approximately 0.03 million Public Offering and Private Placement Transactions On March 15, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (the Representative ), as the representative of the underwriters, relating to a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the Offering of 3,284,422 shares of the Company s common stock at a price to the public of 0.65 per share.

 The closing of the Offering occurred on March 19, 2024. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately 1.7 million. Upon closing of the Offering, the Company issued the Representative certain warrants to purchase up to 182,952 shares of common stock (the Representative s Warrants as compensation. The Representative s Warrants will be exercisable at a per share exercise price of 0.8125. The Representative s Warrants are exercisable, in whole or in part, during the four and one-half-year period commencing 180 days from the commencement of sales of the shares of common stock in the Offering. In connection with the Offering, on March 14, 2024, the Company entered into subscription agreements with each of Robert W. D Loren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company; an affiliate of Mark DiSanto, a director of the Company; and Seth Burroughs, Executive Vice President of Business Development and Treasury of the Company to purchase 132,589, 132,589, and 29,464 shares, respectively (collectively, the Private Placement Shares ), at a price of 0.98 per Private Placement Share. The total number of Private Placement Shares purchased was 294,642. Net proceeds after payment of agent fees to the Representative were approximately 0.3 million. The purchase of the Private Placement Shares closed concurrently with the Offering. The aggregate number of shares of common stock issued from the Offering and the Private Placement was 3,579,064 shares and the total net proceeds received was approximately 1.9 million. Contingent Obligation Isaac Mizrahi Transaction In connection with the May 31, 2022 transaction related to the sale of a majority interest in the Isaac Mizrahi brand, we agreed with WHP (the buyer) that, in the event that IM Topco, LLC receives less than 13.3 million in aggregate royalties for any four consecutive calendar quarters over a three-year period ending on May 31, 2025, WHP would be entitled to receive from us up to 16 million, less all amounts of net cash flow distributed to WHP on an accumulated basis, as an adjustment to the purchase price previously paid by WHP. Such amount would be payable by us in either cash or equity interests in IM Topco, LLC held by us. In November 2023, this agreement was amended such that the purchase price adjustment provision was waived until the measurement period ending March 31, 2024. No amount has been recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets related to this contingent obligation. In April 2024, the Company, WHP, and IM Topco, LLC entered into an amendment to this agreement, such that the purchase price adjustment provision within the membership purchase agreement was waived until the measurement period ending September 30, 2025. Additionally, the parties agreed that if IM Topco, LLC royalties are less than 13.5 million for the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2025 or less than 18.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2025, Xcel shall transfer equity interests in IM Topco, LLC to WHP, such that Xcel s ownership interest in IM Topco, LLC would decrease from 30 to 17.5 , and WHP s ownership interest in IM Topco, LLC would increase from 70 to 82.5 . Prior to the current quarter, no amount was recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheets related to this contingent obligation. However, during the current quarter, management concluded that, based on current trends in and projections of IM Topco s royalty revenues, the Company would likely be required to make such transfer of equity interests to WHP after March 31, 2025. As such, the Company estimated and recorded a contingent obligation of 6.25 million as a reduction to the carrying value of the equity method investment in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

 Contingent Obligation Lori Goldstein Earn-Out In connection with the April 1, 2021 purchase of the Lori Goldstein trademarks, we agreed to pay the seller additional cash consideration of up to 12.5 million, based on royalties earned during the six calendar year period commencing in 2021. The Lori Goldstein Earn-Out was initially recorded as a liability of 6.6 million, based on the difference between the fair value of the acquired assets of the Lori Goldstein Brand and the total consideration paid. As of December 31, 2022, based on the performance of the Lori Goldstein Brand to date, approximately 0.2 million of additional consideration was earned by the seller, and this 0.2 million of additional consideration was paid to the seller during 2023. Based on the performance of the Lori Goldstein Brand through December 31, 2023, approximately 1.0 million of incremental additional consideration was earned by the seller, which would have been paid out in 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company paid approximately 0.3 million of the 1.0 million earned. During the current nine months, as a result of the divestiture of the Lori Goldstein Brand, the seller waived their rights with respect to the Lori Goldstein Earn-Out amounts that had been previously earned and had not yet been paid, and terminated their rights to any future payments under the Lori Goldstein Earn-Out. As a result, the Company de-recognized approximately 1.03 million of accrued Lori Goldstein Earn-Out payments and the remaining balance of approximately 5.05 million of contingent obligations recorded on the Company s balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, there are no liability amounts remaining on the Company s balance sheet related to the Lori Goldstein Earn-Out. Debt Refinancing On December 12, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new loan and security agreement with FEAC Agent, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, FEF Distributors, LLC, as lead arranger, and Restore Capital, LLC, as agent for certain lenders, pursuant to which the lenders made term loans to the Company and agreed to make additional term loans to the Company upon the satisfaction of a condition precedent described in the loan agreement . The term loans under the loan agreement are as follows: (1) a term loan in the amount of 3.95 million Term Loan A was made on the closing date, (2) a term loan in the amount of 4.0 million Term Loan B was made on the closing date, and (3) a term loan in the amount of 2.05 million Delayed Draw Term Loan Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Delayed Draw Term Loan are referred to as Term Loans which will be made upon the satisfaction of a condition precedent described in the loan agreement. The proceeds from Term Loan A and Term Loan B were used to repay the remaining balance of the Company s October 2023 term loan with IDB, as well as to pay fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with entering into the new loan agreement, and the balance may be used for working capital purposes. The proceeds from the Delayed Draw Term Loan will be deposited in a bank account to satisfy a liquidity covenant in the loan agreement. Principal amounts on Term Loans are payable on a pro rata basis in quarterly installments of 250,000 on each of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, commencing on March 31, 2026, with the unpaid balance due at the maturity date of December 12, 2028. Interest on Term Loans accrues at an annual rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for an interest period equal to three months, subject to a 2.0 floor, plus (i) 8.5 for Term Loan A and Delayed Draw Term Loan and (ii) 13.5 for Term Loan B. Interest on amounts outstanding under the Term Loans accrues daily and is payable at the end of each calendar month. The Term Loans are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, and are secured by all of the asset of the Company and such subsidiaries. The loan agreement contains various customary financial covenants and reporting requirements, as specified and defined in the loan agreement. In connection with the loan agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,456,667 shares of the Company s common stock. These warrants have an exercise price of 0.6315 per share, are immediately exercisable, and expire on December 12, 2034.

 Further, IPX Capital, LLC IPX ), a company controlled by Robert W. D Loren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company , purchased a 12.5 undivided, last-out, subordinated participation interest in Term Loan B for a purchase price of 500,000; IPX also received 153,333 of the aforementioned warrants. Also, in October 2024, IPX made a 250,000 non-interest-bearing advance to one of the Company s subsidiaries, of which 200,000 was repaid to IPX upon the closing of the December 12, 2024 debt refinancing transaction Other Factors We continue to seek to expand and diversify the types of licensed products being produced under our brands. We plan to continue to diversify the distribution channels within which licensed products are sold, in an effort to reduce dependence on any particular retailer, consumer, or market sector within each of our brands. The Halston brand, C Wonder brand, and TowerHill by Christie Brinkley brand have a core business in fashion apparel and accessories. The Ripka brand is a fine jewelry business, and the Longaberger brand focuses on home good products, which we believe helps diversify our industry focus while at the same time complements our business operations and relationships. While the 2022 sale of a majority interest in the Isaac Mizrahi brand resulted in a decrease in our licensing revenues, as that brand represented a significant portion of our historical licensing revenues, we have taken and continue to take actions to replace those revenues in the long-term with new strategic business initiatives, as we concentrate our resources on growing our brands, launching new brands, and entering into new business partnerships. We continue to seek new opportunities, including expansion through interactive television, live streaming, and additional domestic and international licensing arrangements, and acquiring and collaborating with additional brands, including the C Wonder by Christian Siriano business on HSN, and the recently-launched TowerHill by Christie Brinkley brand. During 2023, we restructured our business operations by shifting our business from a wholesale/licensing hybrid model into a licensing plus business model. These efforts included entering into new structured contractual arrangements with best-in-class business partners in order to more efficiently operate our wholesale and e-commerce businesses and reduce and better manage our exposure to operating risks. These restructuring initiatives were originally expected to provide us with approximately 15 million of cost savings on an annualized basis compared to our previous operating model. Based on additional actions taken by management during the first nine months of 2024 and the recent divestiture of the Lori Goldstein brand, the Company s direct operating costs on an annualized basis have been reduced from approximately 8 million per quarter under our previous operating model to approximately 2.5 to 3.0 million per quarter on a going-forward basis. This represents approximately 21 million of cost savings on an annualized basis compared to our cost structure in 2022. Nonetheless, we continue to face a number of headwinds in the current macroeconomic environment. Poor economic and market conditions, including the impacts of recent inflation and rising consumer debt levels, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for apparel, footwear, accessories, fine jewelry, home goods, and other consumer products, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation and/or a potential recession, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our long-term success, however, will still remain largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain our brands awareness and continue to attract wholesale and direct-to-consumer customers, and contract with and retain key licensees and business partners, as well as our and our licensees ability to accurately predict upcoming fashion and design trends within their respective customer bases and fulfill the product requirements of the particular retail channels within the global marketplace. Unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences and purchasing patterns, slowdowns in the U.S. economy, changes in the prices of supplies, consolidation of retail establishments, and other factors noted in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K could adversely affect our licensees ability to meet and/or exceed their contractual commitments to us and thereby adversely affect our future operating results. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to exercise judgment. We exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors, including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, and current and expected economic conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Because the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates. Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 19, 2024, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES A. EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES: Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on, and as of the date of such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weakness described below. The basis for the conclusion that such internal control was ineffective included the following considerations: The Company was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K within the time specified in SEC rules and forms, due to a failure to obtain audited financial statements of the Company s investment in an equity method investee. Additional procedures were required for the Company s audit, which impacted on the resources required to timely file the Company s Form 10-K. During the middle of February 2024, our equity method investee (IM Topco, LLC) engaged an independent audit firm (separate from Marcum, LLP) to conduct its audit. We agreed to pay for all fees of the audit, and on February 23, 2024, paid a retainer to the audit firm, in accordance with the engagement. The audit firm was the same firm which conducted the audit for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the same equity method investee and delivered timely such audited financial statements for such prior audit. However, the audit firm for the equity method investee has not completed the 2023 audit on a timely basis. It was determined their progress was significantly deficient, and there would not be sufficient time to engage a new audit firm to receive timely, audited financial statements of the equity method investee. The determination was made by IM Topco, LLC to terminate this firm s 2023 engagement and engage Marcum LLP to provide the 2023 audited financial statements. This engagement is separate from and independent of services that Marcum LLP provides to Xcel.

 B. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING: There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, the Company becomes involved in legal claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. The Company routinely assesses all its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability, and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable. With the exception of the matter described in detail below, in the opinion of management, based on consultations with legal counsel, the disposition of litigation currently pending against the Company is unlikely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a materially adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We operate in a highly competitive industry that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could impact our operations. The risks described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our financial condition and/or operating results. There is a high likelihood that we will be obligated to transfer an additional 12.5 of IM Topco to WHP as we do not expect IM Topco to meet revenue targets set forth in the purchase agreement. In accordance with the May 31, 2022 membership interest purchase agreement, as amended, WHP (as buyer) may be entitled to receive from Xcel 12.5 of the total outstanding equity interests of IM Topco if, during the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2025, IM Topco receives less than 13.5 million in aggregate royalties (the Purchase Price Adjustment ). Based on current trends and projections of IM Topco s revenues, the Company estimates that there is high likelihood that IM Topco s revenues will be less than the required minimum and the Company will be obligated to transfer the required membership interests to WHP in accordance with the Purchase Price Adjustment. The Company has recorded a contingent obligation of approximately 6.3 million as a reduction to the carrying value of the equity method investment as of September 30, 2024, based on the expected March 31, 2025 value of the potential transferred membership interest. If such transfer occurs, our interest in the equity of IM Topco will be reduced from 30 to 17.5 . Our existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. On December 12, 2024, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new loan and security agreement with FEAC Agent, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, FEF Distributors, LLC, as lead arranger, and Restore Capital, LLC, as agent for certain lenders, pursuant to which the lenders made term loans to us and agreed to make additional term loans to us upon the satisfaction of a condition precedent described in the loan agreement. The term loans under the loan agreement are as follows: (1) a term loan in the amount of 3.95 million Term Loan A was made on the closing date, (2) a term loan in the amount of 4.0 million Term Loan B was made on the closing date, and (3) a term loan in the amount of 2.05 million Delayed Draw Term Loan Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Delayed Draw Term Loan are referred to as Term Loans which will be made upon the satisfaction of a condition precedent described in the loan agreement. The proceeds from the Delayed Draw Term Loan were deposited in a bank account to satisfy a liquidity covenant in the loan agreement. Principal amounts on Term Loans are payable on a pro rata basis in quarterly installments of 250,000 on each of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, commencing on March 31, 2026, with the unpaid balance due at the maturity date of December 12, 2028. Interest on Term Loans accrues at an annual rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for an interest period equal to three months, subject to a 2.0 floor, plus (i) 8.5 for Term Loan A and Delayed Draw Term Loan and (ii) 13.5 for Term Loan B. Interest on amounts outstanding under the Term Loans accrues daily and is payable at the end of each calendar month.

Table of Contents 
 The Term Loans are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, and are secured by all of the assets of the Company and such subsidiaries. The loan agreement contains various customary financial covenants and reporting requirements, as specified and defined in the loan agreement, including minimum revenue requirements and an approximately 2.05 million minimum liquidity requirement. In addition, we are required to raise at least 1,500,000 of equity capital by March 31, 2025. If we do not raise the equity capital, the reserve for the liquidity covenant will increase to approximately 4.05 million and the minimum revenue requirements will increase by 12.5 . Our outstanding indebtedness, i ncluding any additional indebtedness beyond our borrowings under the loan agreement, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant adverse consequences, including: Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash resources to the payment of interest and principal, reducing money available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, international expansion, new product development, new enterprise relationships, and other general corporate purposes; Increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and market conditions; Subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing; Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options. 
 We intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our then existing cash and cash equivalents. However, we may not have sufficient funds, and may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due under the loan agreement or any other debt instruments. Failure to make payments or comply with other covenants under our existing loan agreement or such other debt instruments could result in an event of default and acceleration of amounts due, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A breach of the covenants under the loan agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. An event of default under the loan agreement could permit the lenders under the loan agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the loan agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the loan agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lender accelerates the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.

 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION In October 2024, in connection with a required increase to a standby letter of credit associated with the Company s real estate lease for offices located at 1333 Broadway, Robert W. D Loren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, provided a personal guarantee to the financial institution providing such letter of credit, in order to satisfy a portion of the associated collateral requirements for the letter of credit. In connection with the refinancing of the Company s term loan debt in December 2024, IPX Capital, LLC IPX ), a company controlled by Mr. D Loren, purchased a 12.5 undivided, last-out, subordinated participation interest in a portion of the new term loan debt for a purchase price of 500,000. As part of this refinancing transaction, IPX also received 153,333 warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, with such warrants having an exercise price of 0.6315 per share, being immediately exercisable, and expiring on December 12, 2034. Also, in October 2024, IPX made a 250,000 non-interest-bearing advance to one of the Company s subsidiaries, of which 200,000 was repaid to IPX upon the closing of the December 2024 debt refinancing transaction.
