 global economic trends and economic conditions, including heightened inflation, slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, higher interest rates, structural shifts and regulatory changes to the commercial banking systems of the U.S. and Western Europe, labor shortages, currency fluctuations and challenges in global supply chains; 
 the failure of any banks with which we and/or our borrowers have a commercial relationship could adversely affect, among other things, our borrower's ability to access deposits or obtain financing on favorable terms or at all; 
 higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve may lead to a decrease in prepayment speeds and an increase in the number of borrowers who exercise extension options, which could extend beyond the term of certain secured financing agreements we use to finance our loan investments; 
 reduced demand for office space, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or hybrid work schedules which allow work from remote locations other than the employer's office premises; 
 changes in the availability of attractive loan and other investment opportunities, whether they are due to competition, regulation or otherwise; 
 deterioration in the performance of properties securing our investments that may cause deterioration in the performance of our investments, adversely impact certain of our financing arrangements and our liquidity, and potentially expose us to principal losses on our investments;

 At each reporting date, the Company reconsiders its primary beneficiary conclusions for all its VIEs to determine if its obligation to absorb losses of, or its rights to receive benefits from, the VIE could potentially be more than insignificant, and will consolidate or not consolidate in accordance with GAAP.

A loan may be returned to accrual status if all delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current, and collectability of the remaining principal and interest payments in accordance with the loan agreement is reasonably assured. Loans that in the judgment of the Manager, are adequately secured and in the process of collection are maintained on accrual status, even if they are 90 days or more past due. 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 The Company may change its intent, or its assessment of its ability, to hold for the foreseeable future loans held for investment based on changes in the real estate market, capital markets, or when a shift occurs in the Company's approach to loan portfolio construction. Once a determination is made to sell a loan, or the Company determines it no longer has the intent and ability to hold a loan held for investment for the foreseeable future, the loan is transferred to loans held for sale. In accordance with GAAP, loans classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, net of estimated selling costs, and the loan is excluded from the determination of the CECL reserve.

 methods to estimate credit losses in its loan portfolio: (1) a model-based approach; and (2) an individually assessed approach for loans considered to be "collateral-dependent" since the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral, and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty or foreclosure is probable. 
 Once the expected credit loss amount is determined, an allowance for credit losses is established. A loan will be written off through credit loss (expense) benefit, net in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income when it is deemed non-recoverable or upon a realization event. This is generally at the time the loan is settled (including conversion to real estate owned), transferred or exchanged. Non-recoverability may also be concluded by the Company if, in its determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. This loss is equal to the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the carrying value of the asset. Factors considered by the Company in determining whether the expected credit loss is not recoverable include whether the Company determines that the loan is uncollectible, which means repayment is deemed to be delayed beyond a reasonable time, a loss becomes evident due to a borrower s lack of assets and liquidity, or a borrower s sponsor is unwilling or unable to support the loan. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans Held for Investment Model-Based Approach 
 The Company uses a model-based approach used to measure the expected lifetime allowance for credit losses related to loans which are not individually assessed. The model-based approach considers the underlying loan level cash flows and relevant historical market loan loss data. The Company licenses from Trepp, LLC historical loss information, incorporating loan performance data for over commercial real estate loans dating back to 1998, and an analytical model to compute statistical credit loss factors (i.e., probability-of-default, loss severity, and loss-given-default). These credit loss factors are utilized by the Company together with loan specific inputs such as property-level operating performance information, delinquency status, indicators of credit quality, and other credit trends and risk characteristics. Additionally, the Company considers relevant loan and borrower specific qualitative factors and incorporates its expectations about the impact of current macroeconomic and local market conditions and reasonable and supportable operating forecasts on expected future credit losses in deriving its estimate. For the period beyond which the Company is able to make reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to unadjusted historical loan loss information. 
 
 The Company uses other acceptable alternative approaches depending on, among other factors, the type of loan, underlying collateral and availability of relevant historical market loan loss data.

 Renovations and/or replacements that improve or extend the life of the REO are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes costs directly related to the pre-development, development or improvement of its REO, referred to as capital projects. Costs associated with the Company's capital projects are capitalized as incurred. Costs considered for capitalization include, but are not limited to, construction costs, interest (if applicable), real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, if appropriate. The Company capitalizes indirect costs such as personnel, office, and administrative expenses that are directly related to development projects based on an estimate of the time spent on the construction and development activities. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to prepare the asset for its intended use. The Company determines when the capitalization period begins and ends through communication with project and other managers responsible for the tracking and oversight of individual projects. In the event that the activities to ready the asset for its intended use are suspended, the capitalization period will cease until such activities are resumed. 
 REO is initially measured at fair value and is thereafter subject to an ongoing impairment analysis. Subsequent to an REO acquisition, events or circumstances may occur that result in a material and sustained change in the cash flows generated, or expected to be generated, from the property. REO is evaluated for recoverability when impairment indicators are identified. Any impairment loss and gains or losses on sale are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Revenue and expenses from REO operations are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income within Revenue from real estate owned operations and Expenses from real estate owned operations, as applicable. 
 of the senior mortgage loan that the Company originated, and retained as a loan investment a separate mezzanine loan investment secured by a pledge of the equity in the mortgage borrower. With respect to the senior mortgage loans transferred, the Company retains: no control over the mortgage loan; no economic interest in the mortgage loan; and no recourse to the purchaser or the borrower. Consequently, based on these circumstances and because the Company does not have any continuing involvement with the transferred senior mortgage loan, these syndications are accounted for as sales under GAAP and are removed from the Company s consolidated financial statements at the time of transfer. The Company s consolidated balance sheets only include the separate mezzanine loan remaining after the transfer.

 (1) In certain instances, the Company creates structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on the Company s balance sheet.

 The financial covenants and guarantees for outstanding borrowings related to the Company s secured credit agreements and secured revolving credit facility require Holdco to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. The uncertain long-term impact of global macroeconomic conditions, including heightened inflation, slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, sustained higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, labor shortages and structural shifts and regulatory changes in the banking sector, on the commercial real estate markets and global capital markets may make it more difficult to meet or satisfy these covenants, and there can be no assurance that the Company will remain in compliance with these covenants in the future. 
 Financial Covenant Compliance

 of the equity of TRSs. TRSs are subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on their taxable income. In addition, as a REIT, the Company also may be subject to a excise tax on certain transactions between it and its TRSs that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis. The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as various state and local jurisdictions. The filings are subject to normal reviews by tax authorities until the related statute of limitations expires. The years open to examination generally range from 2020 to present. 
 ASC 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company has analyzed its various federal and state filing positions and believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions are well documented and supported. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on the Company s evaluation, the Company did have any material uncertain income tax positions. 
 The Company s policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with underpayment of U.S. federal and state income taxes, if any, as a component of general and administrative expense on its consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did have interest or penalties associated with the underpayment of any income taxes. 
 The Company owns, through an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes Parent LLC ), of the common equity in Sub-REIT, which qualifies as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a separate taxpayer from both the Company and Parent LLC. Parent LLC is owned by the Company both directly and indirectly through a TRS. The Company, through Sub-REIT, issues CRE CLOs to finance on a non-recourse, non-mark-to-market basis a large proportion of its loan investment portfolio. Due to unusually low LIBOR rates between March 2020 and September 2022, coupled with high interest rate floors relating to many loans and participation interests pledged to Sub-REIT s CLOs, certain of Sub-REIT s CRE CLOs have in the past generated EII, which may be treated as UBTI. Published IRS guidance requires that Sub-REIT allocate its EII among its shareholders in proportion to its dividends paid. Accordingly, EII generated by Sub-REIT s CRE CLOs is allocated to Parent LLC. Pursuant to the Parent LLC operating agreement, any EII allocated from Sub-REIT to Parent LLC is allocated further to the TRS. Consequently, no EII is allocated to the Company and, as a result, the Company s shareholders will not be allocated any EII (or UBTI attributable to such EII) by the Company. The tax liability borne by the TRS on the EII is approximately . This tax liability is included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and balance sheets of the Company. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of federal, state, and local tax expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of federal, state, and local tax expense. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had income tax assets and a million income tax liability recorded for the operating activities of the Company s TRSs. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had income tax assets and a million income tax liability recorded for the operating activities of the Company s TRSs. 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had million of remaining capital losses that it can carry forward into future years. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company utilized million of the million of available remaining capital loss carryforwards to offset the capital gain generated from the partial sale of a REO in April 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred a capital loss of million from the sale of an acquired loan. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has million of capital losses, of which million and million will expire at the end of 2025 and 2028, respectively, if unused. 
 The Company does not expect these capital loss carryforwards to reduce the amount that the Company will be required to distribute in accordance with the requirement that the Company distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of the Company s REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain) each year to continue to qualify as a REIT.

For purposes of calculating the Manager s incentive compensation, the Management Agreement specifies that equity securities of the Company or any of the Company s subsidiaries that are entitled to a specified periodic distribution or have other debt characteristics will not constitute equity securities and will not be included in Equity for the purpose of calculating incentive compensation. Instead, the aggregate distribution amount that accrues to such equity securities during the calendar quarter of such calculation will be subtracted from Core Earnings, before incentive compensation for purposes of calculating incentive compensation, unless such distribution is otherwise excluded from Core Earnings. 
 Core Earnings, as defined in the Management Agreement, means the net income (loss) attributable to the holders of the Company s common stock and Class A common stock (in those periods in which such Class A shares were outstanding) and, without duplication, the holders of the Company s subsidiaries equity securities (other than the Company or any of the Company s subsidiaries), computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the incentive compensation, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) any unrealized gains or losses, including an allowance for credit losses, or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss or in net income and (v) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items, in each case after discussions between the Manager and the Company s independent directors and approved by a majority of the Company s independent directors.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited and audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results may differ materially from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed under the heading Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial real estate finance company externally managed by TPG RE Finance Trust Management, L.P., an affiliate of our sponsor TPG. We directly originate, acquire and manage commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments in North America for our balance sheet. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over time through cash distributions and capital appreciation. To meet our objective, we focus primarily on directly originating and selectively acquiring floating rate first mortgage loans that are secured by high quality commercial real estate properties undergoing some form of transition and value creation, such as retenanting, refurbishment or other form of repositioning. The collateral underlying our loans is located in primary and select secondary markets in the U.S. that we believe have attractive economic conditions and commercial real estate fundamentals. We operate our business as one segment. 
 We made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and we believe that our organization and current and intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. 
 We continue to evaluate the effects of macroeconomic concerns, including, without limitation: a period of sustained high interest rates; indications that short-term interest rates may decline; inflation; structural shifts and regulatory changes to the commercial banking systems of the U.S. and Western Europe; geopolitical tensions; concerns of an economic recession in the near term; and changes to the way commercial tenants use real estate, specifically office buildings. Rising interest rates, structural shifts and regulatory changes to the commercial banking systems of the U.S. and Western Europe, increased volatility in debt and equity markets, declines in commercial property values, and elevated geopolitical risk led us to continue to curtail our loan origination volume and maintain high levels of liquidity during 2023 and continuing through 2024. From January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, we originated six first mortgage transitional loans, with total commitments of 320.3 million, an initial unpaid principal balance of 306.8 million, and unfunded commitments at closing of 13.5 million. 
 For more information regarding the impact that current macroeconomic concerns have had and may have on our business, see the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 
 
 Our Manager 
 We are externally managed by our Manager, TPG RE Finance Trust Management, L.P., an affiliate of TPG.

 For a summary of certain terms of the management agreement between us and our Manager (the Management Agreement ), see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 Global economic trends and economic conditions, including heightened inflation, slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, sustained higher interest rates, indications of a future decline in short-term interest rates, currency fluctuations and challenges in the supply chain, political unrest and economic uncertainty due to terrorism or war, structural shifts and regulatory changes to the commercial banking systems of the U.S. and Western Europe, and the lingering aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and may in the future have, an adverse impact on our business, the U.S. and global economies, the real estate industry and our borrowers, and the performance of the properties securing our loans.

 Funded 7.6 million in future funding obligations associated with existing loans. 
 Received three full loan repayments of 141.1 million and partial principal payments of 8.2 million related to one loan, for total loan repayments of 149.3 million. 
 Investment Portfolio Financing Activity: 
 Increased non-recourse, non-mark-to-market asset specific financings by 72.0 million. Non-mark-to-market financing comprised 79.7 of total loan portfolio borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity: 
 Maintained substantial near-term liquidity of 357.0 million, as of September 30, 2024, comprised of: 
 226.3 million of cash-on-hand, of which 211.3 million was available for investment, net of 15.0 million held to satisfy liquidity covenants under our secured financing agreements. 
 Undrawn capacity (liquidity available to us without the need to pledge additional collateral to our lenders) of 128.1 million under secured credit agreements with four lenders, and 2.6 million under other financing arrangements. 
 We have financed our loan investments as of September 30, 2024 utilizing three CRE CLOs totaling 1.7 billion, 498.6 million under secured credit agreements with total commitments of 1.7 billion provided by four lenders, and 204.3 million under asset-specific financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, 70.2 of our borrowings were pursuant to our CRE CLO vehicles, 21.5 were pursuant to our secured credit agreements and secured revolving credit facility and 8.3 were pursuant to our asset-specific financing arrangements. Non-mark-to-market financing comprised 79.7 of total loan portfolio borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our ability to draw on our secured credit agreements and secured revolving credit facility is dependent upon our lenders willingness to accept as collateral loan investments we pledge to them to secure additional borrowings. These financing arrangements have credit spreads based upon the LTV and other risk characteristics of collateral pledged, and provide financing with mark-to-market provisions limited to collateral-specific events (i.e., "credit" marks). Borrowings under our secured revolving credit agreement are permitted with respect to collateral that satisfies pre-determined eligibility standards, and have a pre-determined advance rate (generally, 75 of the unpaid principal balance pledged) and credit spread (Term SOFR plus 2.00 ). As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under these secured credit agreements and secured revolving credit facility had a weighted average credit spread of 1.96 (1.95 for arrangements with mark-to-market provisions and 2.00 for one arrangement with no mark-to-market provisions), and a weighted average term to extended maturity assuming exercise of all extension options and term-out provisions of 2.5 years. These financing arrangements are generally 25 recourse to Holdco, with the exception of the secured revolving credit facility that is 100 recourse to Holdco.

 Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 As a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared per common share, Distributable Earnings, and book value per common share. As further described below, Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use Distributable Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current investment activity and operations. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income attributable to common stockholders of 0.23 per diluted common share, a decrease of 0.03 per diluted common share from the three months ended June 30, 2024, of which 0.05 per diluted common share relates to a decrease quarter over quarter in our credit loss benefit, which was a 0.3 million benefit during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 4.5 million benefit during the second quarter of 2024. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net interest income of 0.02 per diluted common share. 
 Distributable Earnings per diluted common share was 0.28 for three months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we declared a cash dividend of 0.24 per common share which was paid on October 25, 2024. 
 Our book value per common share as of September 30, 2024 was 11.41, a decrease of 0.45 per common share from our book value per common share as of December 31, 2023 of 11.86, primarily due to the exercise of the Warrants during the six months ended June 30, 2024, which resulted in the issuance of 2,647,059 shares of our common stock, diluting our book value by 0.38 per common share. 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income attributable to common stockholders per share and dividends declared per share (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data):

 ____________________________ 
 (1) Includes preferred stock dividends declared and paid for Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 (2) Basic and diluted earnings per common share are computed independently based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share includes the impact of participating securities outstanding. Prior to the May 8, 2024 Warrant exercise, diluted earnings per common share included any incremental shares that would be outstanding assuming the exercise of the Warrants. 
 Distributable Earnings 
 Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders, including realized gains and losses from loan write-offs, loan sales and other loan resolutions (including conversions to REO), regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in GAAP net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash stock compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iii) unrealized gains (losses) (including credit loss expense (benefit), net), and (iv) certain non-cash or income and expense items. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense from the calculation of Distributable Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We generally must distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income annually, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gains, for us to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that one of the primary reasons investors purchase our common stock is to receive our dividends. Because of our investors continued focus on our ability to pay dividends, Distributable Earnings is an important measure for us to consider when determining our distribution policy and dividends per common share. Further, Distributable Earnings helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan investment and operating activities. 
 Distributable Earnings excludes the impact of our credit loss provision or reversals of our credit loss provision, but only to the extent that our credit loss provision exceeds any realized credit losses during the applicable reporting period. 
 A loan will be written off as a realized loss when it is deemed non-recoverable or upon a realization event. Such a realized loss would generally be recognized at the time the loan receivable is settled, transferred or exchanged, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying property is foreclosed upon or sold. Non-recoverability may also be concluded by us if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. A realized loss may equal the difference between the cash or consideration received or expected to be received, and the net book value of the loan, reflecting our economics as it relates to the ultimate realization of the asset. 
 Distributable Earnings does not represent net income (loss) or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings reported by other companies.

 (1) In certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third-party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our balance sheet. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third-party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan. Total loan exposure encompasses the entire loan portfolio we originated, acquired and financed. We did not have any non-consolidated senior interests as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, total loan exposure includes one fixed rate contiguous mezzanine loan. 
 (2) Unpaid principal balance includes PIK interest of 0.2 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) Unfunded loan commitments may be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date or a force-funding date, primarily to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by our borrowers and to finance operating deficits during renovation and lease-up. 
 (4) As of September 30, 2024, all of our floating rate loans were indexed to Term SOFR. In addition to credit spread, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, purchase price premium and discount, and accrual of both extension and exit fees. All-in yield for the total portfolio assumes Term SOFR as of September 30, 2024 for weighted average calculations. 
 (5) Extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of September 30, 2024, based on the unpaid principal balance of our total loan exposure, 16.6 of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 83.4 were open to repayment without penalty. 
 (6) Except for construction loans, LTV is calculated for loan originations and existing loans as the total outstanding principal balance of the loan or participation interest in a loan (plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan or participation interest) divided by the as-is appraised value of our collateral at the time of origination or acquisition of such loan or participation interest. For construction loans only, LTV is calculated as the total commitment amount of the loan divided by the as-stabilized value of the real estate securing the loan. The as-is or as-stabilized (as applicable) value reflects our Manager s estimates, at the time of origination or acquisition of the loan or participation interest in a loan, of the real estate value underlying such loan or participation interest determined in accordance with our Manager s underwriting standards and consistent with third-party appraisals obtained by our Manager.

 During the three months ended March 31, 2024, as part of our quarterly risk rating process, we downgraded one hotel loan from "2" to "3" due to a decrease in occupancy and we downgraded one multifamily loan from "3" to "4" due to a decrease in operating performance. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we received repayment in full of five loans with a total unpaid principal balance of 211.3 million and a weighted average risk rating of 3.2 as of December 31, 2023. The five loan repayments were included within our hotel, other, and multifamily property categories. The hotel loan had a risk rating of "4", while the three multifamily loans and other loan each had a risk rating of "3" as of December 31, 2023. The three new loan investments made during the three months ended March 31, 2024 were assigned an initial risk rating of "3". 
 Loan Modification Activity 
 Loan modifications and amendments are commonplace in the transitional lending business. We may amend or modify a loan depending on the loan s specific facts and circumstances. These loan modifications typically include additional time for the borrower to refinance or sell the collateral property, adjustment or waiver of performance tests that are prerequisite to the extension of a loan maturity, modification of terms of interest rate cap agreements, and/or deferral of scheduled principal payments. In exchange for a modification, we often receive a partial repayment of principal, a short-term accrual of PIK interest for a portion of interest due, a cash infusion to replenish interest or capital improvement reserves, termination of all or a portion of the remaining unfunded loan commitment, additional call protection, and/or an increase in the loan coupon or additional loan fees. We continue to work with our borrowers to address issues as they arise while seeking to preserve the credit attributes of our loans. However, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful, and we may experience payment delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, or losses. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Our allowance for credit losses is influenced by the size and weighted average maturity date of our loans, loan quality, risk rating, delinquency status, loan-to-value ratio, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a decrease of 0.3 million and 0.5 million, respectively, in our allowance for credit losses resulting in an aggregate CECL reserve of 69.3 million at quarter-end. This decrease was primarily attributable to improved asset level performance and a decrease in the general reserve which includes macroeconomic assumptions that reflect ongoing concerns about growing geopolitical tensions, the potential impact of market volatility, the general level of interest rates and slope of the yield curve, the possibility of an economic recession, limited liquidity in the capital markets, structural shifts and regulatory changes in the banking sector and a slowdown in investment sales, and loan specific property-level performance trends such as shifting office market fundamentals and inflationary pressures that may cause operating margins to narrow. 
 While the ultimate impact of the macroeconomic outlook and property performance trends remain uncertain, we selected our macroeconomic outlook to address this uncertainty, and made specific forward-looking adjustments to the inputs of our loan-level calculations to reflect collateral operating performance, credit structure features of loan documents, variability in an economic climate marked by sustained higher interest rates, and other impacts to the broader economy.

 Investment Portfolio Financing 
 We finance our investment portfolio using secured financing agreements, including secured credit agreements, secured revolving credit facilities, mortgage loans payable, asset-specific financing arrangements, and collateralized loan obligations. In certain instances, we may create structural leverage and obtain matched-term financing through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party (a non-consolidated senior interest ). We generally seek to match-fund and match-index our investments by minimizing the differences between the durations and indices of our investments and those of our liabilities, while minimizing our exposure to mark-to-market risk.

 Secured Credit Agreements 
 As of September 30, 2024, aggregate borrowings outstanding under our secured credit agreements totaled 0.5 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the overall weighted average interest rate was the benchmark interest rate plus 1.95 per annum and the overall weighted average advance rate was 77.3 . As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average term to extended maturity of 2.6 years assuming the exercise of all extension options and term-out provisions. These secured credit agreements are generally 25.0 recourse to Holdco.

 ________________________________ 
 (1) Commitment amount represents the maximum amount of borrowings available under a given agreement once sufficient collateral assets have been approved by the lender and pledged by us. 
 (2) Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets. The funding of such amounts is generally subject to the sole and absolute discretion of each lender. 
 (3) Represents the commitment amount less the approved borrowings, which amount is available to be borrowed provided we pledge, and the lender approves, additional collateral assets. 
 (4) Each secured credit agreement interest rate is subject to Term SOFR as its benchmark interest rate. The credit spread for each arrangement is added to Term SOFR to calculate the interest rate charged for each borrowing. 
 (5) Our ability to extend our secured credit agreements to the dates shown above is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Even if extended, our lenders retain sole discretion to determine whether to accept pledged collateral, and the advance rate and credit spread applicable to each borrowing thereunder. 
 Once we identify an asset and the asset is approved by the secured credit agreement lender to serve as collateral (which lender s approval is in its sole discretion), we and the lender may enter into a transaction whereby the lender advances to us a percentage of the value of the loan asset, which is referred to as the advance rate. In the case of borrowings under our secured credit agreements that are repurchase arrangements, this advance serves as the purchase price at which the lender acquires the loan asset from us with an obligation of ours to repurchase the asset from the lender for an amount equal to the purchase price for the transaction plus a price differential, which is calculated based on an interest rate. Advance rates are subject to negotiation between us and our secured credit agreement lenders. 
 For each transaction, we and the lender agree to a trade confirmation which sets forth, among other things, the asset purchase price, the maximum advance rate, the interest rate and the market value of the asset. For transactions under our secured credit agreements, the trade confirmation may also set forth any future funding obligations which are contemplated with respect to the specific transaction and/or the underlying loan asset and loan-specific margin maintenance provisions, described below. 
 Generally, our secured credit agreements allow for revolving balances, which allow us to voluntarily repay balances and draw again on existing available credit. The primary obligor on each secured credit agreement is a separate special purpose subsidiary of ours which is restricted from conducting activity other than activity related to the utilization of its secured credit agreement and the loans or loan interests that are originated or acquired by such subsidiary. As additional credit support, our holding company subsidiary, Holdco, provides certain guarantees of the obligations of its subsidiaries. Holdco s liability is generally capped at 25 of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. However, this liability cap does not apply in the event of certain bad boy defaults which can trigger recourse to Holdco for losses or the entire outstanding obligations of the borrower depending on the nature of the bad boy default in question. Examples of such bad boy defaults include, without limitation, fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct, incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents, and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity.

Table of Contents 

 Each of the secured credit agreements have margin maintenance provisions, which are designed to allow the lender to maintain a certain margin of credit enhancement against the assets which serve as collateral. The lender s margin amount is typically based on a percentage of the market value of the asset and/or mortgaged property collateral; however, certain secured credit agreements may also involve margin maintenance based on maintenance of a minimum debt yield with respect to the cash flow from the underlying real estate collateral. In certain cases, margin maintenance provisions can relate to minimum debt yields for pledged collateral considered as a whole, or limits on concentration of loan exposure measured by property type or loan type. 
 Our secured credit agreements contain defined mark-to-market provisions that permit the lenders to issue margin calls to us in the event that the collateral properties underlying our loans pledged to our lenders experience a non-temporary decline in value or net cash flow credit marks ). In the event that we experience market turbulence, we may be exposed to margin calls in connection with our secured credit agreements. 
 The maturity dates for each of our secured credit agreements are set forth in tables that appear earlier in this section. Our secured credit agreements generally have terms of between one and three years, but may be extended if we satisfy certain performance-based conditions. In the normal course of business, we maintain discussions with our lenders to extend, amend or otherwise optimize any financing agreements related to our loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average haircut (which is equal to one minus the advance rate percentage against collateral for our secured credit agreements taken as a whole) was 22.7 compared to 22.3 as of December 31, 2023. 
 The secured credit agreements also include cash management features which generally require that income from collateral loan assets be deposited in a lender-controlled account for distribution in accordance with a specified waterfall of payments designed to keep facility-related obligations current before such income is disbursed for our own account. The cash management features generally require the trapping of cash in such controlled account if an uncured default under our borrowing arrangement remains outstanding. Furthermore, some secured credit agreements may require an accelerated principal amortization schedule if the secured credit agreement is in its final extended term. 
 Notwithstanding that a loan asset may be subject to a financing arrangement and serve as collateral under a secured credit agreement, we retain the right to administer and service the loan and interact directly with the underlying obligors and sponsors of our loan assets so long as there is no default under the secured credit agreement, and so long as we do not engage in certain material modifications (including amendments, waivers, exercises of remedies, or releases of obligors and collateral, among other things) of the loan assets without the lender s prior consent.

 Secured Revolving Credit Facility 
 On February 22, 2022, we closed a 250.0 million secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of five banks to provide interim funding of up to 180 days for newly originated and existing loans. During the fourth quarter of 2022, an additional lender was added to the facility, increasing the borrowing capacity to 290.0 million. This facility has an initial term of three years, an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 2.00 that is payable monthly in arrears, and an unused fee of 15 or 20 basis points, depending upon whether utilization exceeds 50.0 . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average unused fee was 20 and 20 basis points, respectively. This facility is 100 recourse to Holdco. As of September 30, 2024, we pledged one loan investment with a collateral principal balance of 41.3 million and had outstanding Term SOFR-based borrowings of 31.0 million. 
 Asset-Specific Financing Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three separate asset-specific financing arrangements with three third-party lenders. On December 5, 2023, we closed a 90.6 million asset-specific financing facility (the "HSBC Facility"). During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the borrowings pursuant to the HSBC facility by 72.0 million to a total of 162.6 million, with the pledge of an additional loan. The HSBC Facility provides asset-specific financing on a non-mark-to-market basis with matched term. This facility is 20 recourse to Holdco. On November 17, 2022, we closed a 23.3 million asset-specific financing arrangement with Customers Bank. The arrangement provides non-mark-to-market matched term, non-recourse financing. On June 30, 2022, we closed a 200.0 million loan financing facility (the "BMO Facility"). The BMO Facility provides asset-specific financing on a non-mark-to-market basis with matched term. This facility is 25 recourse to Holdco.

 Collateralized Loan Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three collateralized loan obligations, TRTX 2022-FL5, TRTX 2021-FL4, and TRTX 2019-FL3, totaling 1.7 billion, financing 2.3 billion, or 70.5 , of our loans held for investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our CRE CLOs provide low cost, non-mark-to-market, non-recourse financing for 70.2 of our loan portfolio borrowings. The collateralized loan obligations bear a weighted average interest rate of Term SOFR plus 2.00 , and have a weighted average advance rate of 78.0 . Each CRE CLO included a reinvestment feature that allowed us to contribute existing or new loan investments in exchange for proceeds from loan repayments held by the CRE CLOs. The last of these reinvestment windows closed in February 2024.

 (4) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized interest expense of 33.5 million, which includes 0.7 million of deferred financing cost amortization. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized interest expense of 105.4 million, which includes 3.5 million of deferred financing cost amortization. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized our eligible reinvestment feature related to TRTX 2022-FL5 14 times, recycling 255.2 million of principal repayments received. The reinvestment period for TRTX 2019-FL3 ended on October 11, 2021. The reinvestment period for TRTX 2021-FL4 ended on March 11, 2023. The reinvestment period for TRTX 2022-FL5 ended on February 9, 2024. In accordance with the TRTX 2022-FL5 indenture, prior to the end of the reinvestment period on February 9, 2024, we committed to contribute certain assets and completed the contribution process on April 12, 2024. 
 See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for details about our CRE CLO reinvestment feature. 
 
 Mortgage Loan Payable 
 Through a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary, we are the borrower under a 31.2 million mortgage loan secured by a deed of trust against an REO asset. The first mortgage loan was provided by an institutional lender, has an interest-only five-year term and bears interest at a rate of 7.7 . As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the loan was 30.7 million. 
 
 Non-Consolidated Senior Interests and Retained Mezzanine Loans 
 In certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our balance sheet. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there are no non-consolidated senior interests or retained mezzanine loans outstanding.

 Financial Covenants for Outstanding Borrowings 
 For a description of our financial covenants and guarantees for outstanding borrowings related to our secured financing agreements, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 Effective September 30, 2023, we obtained from our lenders a waiver with respect to the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant. This waiver reduced the minimum interest coverage ratio to 1.30 to 1.0 from 1.40 to 1.0 for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023. The interest coverage ratio threshold reverted to 1.40 to 1.0 for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 and thereafter. 
 We were in compliance with all financial covenants for our investment portfolio financing arrangements to the extent of outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 If we fail to satisfy any of the covenants in our financing arrangements and are unable to obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders, we would be in default under these agreements, which could result in a cross-default or cross-acceleration under other financing arrangements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable (or such amounts may automatically become due and payable), terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. A default also could significantly limit our financing alternatives, which could cause us to curtail our investment activities or dispose of assets when we otherwise would not choose to do so. Further, this could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 Floating Rate Loan Portfolio 
 Our business model seeks to minimize our exposure to changing interest rates by match-indexing our assets using the same, or similar, benchmark indices. Accordingly, rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income, subject to the impact of interest rate floors in our mortgage loan investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, 99.8 of our loan investments by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that require interest payments based on floating rates, which resulted in 0.8 billion of net floating rate exposure, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on all our floating rate loans and less than 6.0 of our floating rate liabilities. The weighted average interest rate floor on the mortgage loan investment portfolio was 1.60 and the weighted average interest rate floor on the liabilities was 0.11 as of September 30, 2024. Subject to the specific footnote disclosures in the preceding tables describing our revolving credit facilities, secured financing arrangements, asset-specific financing arrangements and CRE CLOs, and the table that follows, our liabilities are generally index-matched to each loan investment asset, resulting in a net exposure to movements in floating benchmark interest rates that varies based on the relative proportion of floating rate assets and liabilities. 
 The following table details the net floating rate exposure of our loan portfolio by unpaid principal balance as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Net exposure Floating rate mortgage loan assets (1)

 __________________________________ 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024, all of our floating rate mortgage loan assets and all of our outstanding floating rate mortgage loan liabilities were subject to Term SOFR as the benchmark interest rate.

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income increased by 1.8 million to 29.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 27.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to net repayments on our secured financing arrangements during the third quarter of 35.6 million and interest savings during the third quarter from repayments on our secured financing arrangement related to full loan repayments during the second quarter.

Table of Contents 

 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue decreased 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due primarily to a decrease in revenue from real estate owned operations of 0.6 million during the current period due to common area maintenance billings in the second quarter of 2024 and a decline in interest earned on lower cash balances of 0.3 million. 
 Other Expenses 
 Other expenses decreased 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense resulting from vesting of shares during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Credit Loss Benefit (Expense) 
 Credit loss benefit decreased by 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.3 million decrease in our allowance for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to improved asset-level performance and changes to the macroeconomic assumptions employed in determining the general CECL reserve compared to a 4.5 million decrease during the three months ended June 30, 2024. See Notes 3 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional details regarding our allowance for credit losses, risk ratings, and property type concentration risk. 
 Preferred Stock Dividends and Participating Securities Share in Earnings 
 During each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we declared and paid a cash dividend of 3.1 million related to our Series C Preferred Stock. 
 Dividends Declared Per Common Share 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we declared cash dividends of 0.24 per common share, or 19.7 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we declared cash dividends of 0.24 per common share, or 19.8 million.

Diluted earnings per common share includes the impact of participating securities outstanding. Prior to the May 8, 2024 Warrant exercise, diluted earnings per common share included any incremental shares that would be outstanding assuming the exercise of the Warrants. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income increased 16.2 million to 83.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 67.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to net repayments on our secured financing arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 555.7 million and a decrease in the number of loans on non-accrual including those on cost-recovery, which totaled eight throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to none during the comparable period. The weighted average strike interest rate on the interest rate floors embedded in our loans increased from 1.06 as of September 30, 2023 to 1.60 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue increased 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to operating revenue from an office property acquired through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure during the second quarter of 2023 and an additional three office properties and one multifamily property acquired during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 Other Expenses 
 Other expenses increased 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses from real estate owned of 20.9 million from an office property acquired through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure during the second quarter of 2023, and an additional three office properties and one multifamily property acquired during the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was offset by a decrease in management fees of 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Credit Loss Benefit (Expense) 
 Credit loss expense decreased by 173.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 0.5 million benefit to our allowance for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 172.7 million expense recognized during the comparable period. The credit loss expense decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a decrease of 1.8 million related to our net loan activity during the quarter, partially offset by an increase of 1.4 million related to macroeconomic assumptions employed in determining the general CECL reserve. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 150.6 million of realized losses from loan sales in addition to loan conversions to real estate owned. We increased our allowance for credit losses due to weakening credit indicators, rising interest rates, inflationary expectations, an uncertain macroeconomic outlook that informed a more conservative macroeconomic forecast used to estimate our potential future credit losses, weakening conditions in the capital markets and a decline in investment sales, and new loan investments offset by loan repayments in full. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional details regarding our allowance for credit losses and risk ratings. 
 Preferred Stock Dividends and Participating Securities Share in Earnings 
 During each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends of 9.4 million related to our Series C Preferred Stock. 
 Dividends Declared Per Common Share 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared cash dividends of 0.72 per common share, or 58.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared cash dividends of 0.72 per common share, or 56.9 million.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capitalization 
 We have capitalized our business to-date through, among other things, the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, issuance of Series C Preferred Stock classified as permanent equity, issuance of Series B Preferred Stock treated as temporary equity, borrowings under secured credit agreements, secured revolving credit facilities, collateralized loan obligations, mortgage loan payable, asset-specific financings, and non-consolidated senior interests. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 80.9 million shares of our common stock representing 0.9 billion of stockholders equity, and 2.5 billion of outstanding borrowings used to finance our investments and operations. 
 See Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for details regarding our borrowings under secured credit agreements, a secured revolving credit facility, asset-specific financings and collateralized loan obligations.

 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under secured credit agreements, available borrowings under our asset-specific financing arrangements, capacity in our collateralized loan obligations available for reinvestment, and a secured revolving credit facility. 
 Our current sources of near-term liquidity are set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 226,317 206,376 Secured credit agreements 128,062 24,784 Secured revolving credit facility Asset-specific financing arrangements 2,614 1,592 Collateralized loan obligation proceeds held at trustee 247,229 Total 356,993 479,981 
 Our existing loan portfolio may provide us with liquidity as loans are repaid or sold, in whole or in part, of which some proceeds may be included in accounts receivable from our servicers until released and the proceeds from such repayments become available for us to reinvest. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loan repayments (including 1.2 million of accrued PIK interest) totaled 563.2 million. We held unencumbered loan investments with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of 35.7 million that are eligible to pledge under our existing financing arrangements. We also hold five REO properties with an aggregate carrying value of 188.5 million. One of our REO properties is financed and the remaining four properties are unencumbered and thus create financing capacity. Additionally, proceeds from the sale of REO properties may provide us with liquidity. 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 In addition to our ongoing loan activity, our primary liquidity needs include interest and principal payments under our 2.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under secured credit agreements, a secured revolving credit facility, asset-specific financing arrangements, and collateralized loan obligations, the repurchase or deleveraging of loans, 122.3 million of unfunded loan commitments on our loans held for investment, dividend distributions to our preferred and common stockholders, operating expenses, and repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to a 25.0 million share repurchase program that our Board of Directors approved on April 25, 2024.

 (1) The allocation of our unfunded loan commitments for our loans held for investment portfolio is based on the earlier of the commitment expiration date and the loan maturity date. 
 (2) Collateralized loan obligation liabilities are based on the fully extended maturity of mortgage loan collateral, considering the reinvestment window of our collateralized loan obligation. 
 (3) The allocation of secured credit agreements and secured revolving credit facility is based on the extended maturity date for those secured financing agreements where extensions are at our option, subject to no default, or the current maturity date of those facilities where extension options are subject to counterparty approval. 
 (4) The allocation of asset-specific financing arrangements are based on the fully extended maturity date of the underlying mortgage loan collateral. 
 (5) Amounts include the related future interest payment obligations, which are estimated by assuming the amounts outstanding under our secured debt agreements, asset-specific financing arrangements and collateralized loan obligations and the interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024 will remain constant into the future. This is only an estimate, as actual amounts borrowed and rates will vary over time. Our floating rate loans and our related liabilities are indexed to Term SOFR. 
 With respect to our debt obligations that are contractually due within the next five years, we plan to employ several strategies to meet these obligations, including: (i) exercising maturity date extension options that exist in our current financing arrangements; (ii) negotiating extensions of terms with our providers of credit; (iii) periodically accessing the private and public equity and debt capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments or the repayment of indebtedness; (iv) the issuance of additional structured finance vehicles, such as collateralized loan obligations similar to TRTX 2022-FL5, TRTX 2021-FL4, or TRTX 2019-FL3 as a method of financing; (v) the establishment of new asset-specific financing arrangements, including matched-term note-on-note facilities; (vi) term loans with private lenders; (vii) selling loans and REO to generate cash to repay our debt obligations; (viii) encumbering REO properties to generate cash; and/or (ix) applying repayments from underlying loans to satisfy the debt obligations which they secure. Although these avenues have been available to us in the past, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to access any or all of these alternatives in the future. 
 We are required to pay our Manager a base management fee, an incentive fee, and reimbursements for certain expenses pursuant to our Management Agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our Management Agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Manager did not earn an incentive management fee. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our Management Agreement. 
 As a REIT, we generally must distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to stockholders in the form of dividends to comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In 2017, the IRS issued a revenue procedure permitting publicly offered REITs to make elective stock dividends (i.e., dividends paid in a mixture of stock and cash), with at least 20 of the total distribution being paid in cash, to satisfy their REIT distribution requirements. Pursuant to this revenue procedure, we may elect to make future distributions of our taxable income in a mixture of stock and cash.

 Our REIT taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP or our Distributable Earnings as described above. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional details. 
 
 Corporate Activities 
 Dividends 
 Upon the approval of our Board of Directors, we accrue dividends. We intend to distribute each year not less than 90 of our taxable income to our stockholders to comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Board of Directors will determine whether to pay future dividends, entirely in cash, or in a combination of stock and cash based on facts and circumstances at the time such decisions are made. 
 On September 13, 2024, our Board of Directors declared and approved a cash dividend of 0.24 per share of common stock, or 19.7 million in the aggregate, for the third quarter of 2024.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, interest income and other revenue recognition, allowance for loan losses, expense recognition, tax liability, future impairment of our investments, valuation of our investment portfolio and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, among other items. Our management bases these estimates and judgments about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. 
 If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that our judgments, estimates and assumptions could change, which may result in a change in our interest income and other revenue recognition, allowance for loan losses, expense recognition, tax liability, future write-offs of our investments, and valuation of our investment portfolio, among other effects. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting estimates could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates as described within "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Form 10-K Filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 
 Real Estate Owned 
 Upon the acquisition of a property, we assess the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, which are on a relative fair value basis. The most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market based estimates and assumptions. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 In determining the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property, we consider the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. 
 
 Acquired above and below-market leases are recorded at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for favorable leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for unfavorable leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024, on January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standard Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, and subsequent amendments, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model. The initial CECL reserve recorded on January 1, 2020 is reflected as a direct charge to our retained earnings on the consolidated statements of changes in equity. Subsequent changes to the CECL reserve are recognized through net income on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The allowance for credit losses measured under the CECL accounting framework represents an estimate of current expected losses for our existing portfolio of loans held for investment and is presented as a valuation reserve on our consolidated balance sheets. Expected credit losses related to non-cancelable unfunded loan commitments are accounted for as separate liabilities included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment, as reported in our consolidated balance sheets, is adjusted by a credit loss (expense) benefit, which is reported in earnings in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and reduced by the write-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries and additions related to purchased credit-deteriorated PCD assets, if relevant. The allowance for credit losses includes a modeled component and an individually assessed component. We have elected to not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables related to all of our loans held for investment because we write off uncollectible accrued interest receivable in a timely manner pursuant to our non-accrual policy. 
 We consider key credit quality indicators in underwriting loans and estimating credit losses, including but not limited to: the capitalization of borrowers and sponsors; the expertise of the borrowers and sponsors in a particular real estate sector and geographic market; collateral type; geographic region; use and occupancy of the property; property market value; loan-to-value LTV ratio; loan amount and lien position; debt service and coverage ratio; our risk rating for the same and similar loans; and prior experience with the borrower and sponsor. This information is used to assess the financial and operating capability, experience and profitability of the sponsor/borrower. Ultimate repayment of our loans is sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions, liquidity, LTV ratio, existence of a liquid investment sales market for commercial properties, and availability of replacement short-term or long-term financing. The loans in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio are secured by collateral of the following property types: office; life science; multifamily; hotel; industrial; mixed-use; and self storage. 
 Our loans are typically collateralized by real estate, or in the case of mezzanine loans, by a partnership interest or similar equity interest in the entity that owns the real estate securing our first mortgage loan. We regularly evaluate on a loan-by-loan basis, typically no less frequently than quarterly, the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, and the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor. We also evaluate the financial strength of loan guarantors, if any, and the borrower s competency in managing and operating the property or properties. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management personnel and evaluated by senior management, who utilize various data sources, including, to the extent available (i) periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower s exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections, (iii) sales and financing comparables, (iv) current credit spreads for refinancing and (v) other market data. 
 Quarterly, we evaluate the risk of all loans and assigns a risk rating based on a variety of factors, whereby no single factor on its own, whether quantitative or qualitative, is given more weight than others. The factors that we consider in connection with this evaluation are grouped as follows: (i) loan and credit structure, including the as-is LTV and structural features; (ii) quality and stability of real estate value and operating cash flow, including debt yield, property type, dynamics of the geography, property type and local market, physical condition, stability of cash flow, leasing velocity and quality and diversity of tenancy; (iii) performance against underwritten business plan; and (iv) quality, experience and financial condition of sponsor, borrower and guarantor(s). Based on a 5-point scale, our loans are rated 1 through 5, from least risk to greatest risk, respectively: 
 1 - Very Low Risk 
 2 - Low Risk 
 3 - Medium Risk 
 4 - High Risk/Potential for Loss A loan that has a risk of realizing a principal loss; and 
 5 - Default/Loss Likely A loan that has a very high risk of realizing a principal loss or has otherwise incurred a principal loss. 
 We generally assign a risk rating of 3 to all loans originated or acquired during the most recent quarter, except when specific circumstances warrant an exception.

 Our CECL reserve also reflects estimates of the current and future economic conditions that impact the performance of the commercial real estate assets securing the loans. These estimates include unemployment rates, inflation rates, interest rates, price indices for commercial property, current and expected future availability of liquidity in the commercial property debt and equity capital markets, and other macroeconomic factors that may influence the likelihood and magnitude of potential credit losses for our loans during their anticipated term. We license certain macroeconomic financial forecasts to inform our view of the potential future impact that broader economic conditions may have on our loan portfolio s performance. Selection of the economic forecast or forecasts used, in conjunction with loan level inputs, to determine the CECL reserve requires significant judgment about future events that, while based on the information available to us as of the balance sheet date, are ultimately unknowable with certainty. The actual economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio could vary significantly from the estimates made for the periods presented. 
 The commercial property investment sales and commercial mortgage loan markets have experienced uneven liquidity due to global macroeconomic conditions, including heightened inflation, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, sustained higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, labor shortages and structural shifts and regulatory changes in the banking sector, which continue to make it more difficult to estimate key inputs for estimating the allowance for credit losses. The amount of allowance for credit losses is influenced by the size of our loan portfolio, loan asset quality, risk rating, delinquency status, historic loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We employ two methods to estimate credit losses in our loan portfolio: (1) a model-based approach and (2) an individually assessed approach for loans considered to be "collateral-dependent" as the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty or foreclosure is probable. Estimates made by us are necessarily subject to change due to the limited number of observable inputs and uncertainty regarding the global macroeconomic conditions described above. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further discussion of our methodologies. 
 Significant judgment is required when estimating future credit losses and, as a result, actual losses over time could be materially different. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a decrease of 0.3 million and 0.5 million, respectively, to our allowance for credit losses. The credit loss allowance was 69.3 million as of September 30, 2024.

 _______________________________ 
 Numbers presented may not foot due to rounding. 
 (1) First mortgage loans are whole mortgage loans unless otherwise noted. 
 (2) Date loan was originated or acquired by us. The origination or acquisition date is not updated for subsequent loan modifications. 
 (3) Represents unpaid principal balance net of unamortized costs. 
 (4) In addition to the interest rate, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, purchase price premium and discount, and accrual of both extension and exit fees. All-in yield for our loan assets and total loan portfolio excludes the applicable floating benchmark interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and excludes the impact of our interest rate floors and borrower interest rate caps. 
 (5) Extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of September 30, 2024, based on unpaid principal balance, 16.6 of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 83.4 were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty. 
 (6) Except for construction loans, LTV is calculated for loan originations and existing loans as the total outstanding principal balance of the loan or participation interest in a loan (plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan or participation interest) divided by the as-is appraised value of our collateral at the time of origination or acquisition of such loan or participation interest. For construction loans only, LTV is calculated as the total commitment amount of the loan divided by the as-stabilized value of the real estate securing the loan. The as-is or as-stabilized (as applicable) value reflects our Manager s estimates, at the time of origination or acquisition of the loan or participation interest in a loan, of the real estate value underlying such loan or participation interest determined in accordance with our Manager s underwriting standards and consistent with third-party appraisals obtained by our Manager. 
 (7) For a discussion of risk ratings, please see Notes 2 and 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 (8) Represents the weighted average of the credit spread as of September 30, 2024 for the loans, 99.7 of which are floating rate. 
 (9) The loan is comprised of a first mortgage loan of 245.0 million and a contiguous mezzanine loan of 11.3 million, both of which we own. The first mortgage loan carries an interest rate of S+3.40 and the mezzanine loan has a fixed 8.0 PIK interest rate. 
 (10) Calculated as the ratio of unpaid principal balance as of September 30, 2024 to the as-is appraised value at origination, to reflect the sale by us in August 2020 of the contiguous mezzanine loan with an unpaid principal balance of 46.4 million and a commitment amount of 50.0 million as of sale date. 
 (11) This loan is comprised of a first mortgage loan of 75.5 million and a contiguous mezzanine loan of 82.0 million, both of which we own. Each loan carries the same interest rate. 
 (12) This loan represents a 41.2 pari passu participation interest in a first mortgage loan, that was originated by a third party on August 31, 2021 and acquired by us on September 1, 2022. 
 (13) This loan was originated by a third party on June 9, 2021 and acquired by us on September 1, 2022.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Investment Portfolio Risks 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our business model seeks to minimize our exposure to changing interest rates by matching duration of our assets and liabilities and match-indexing our assets using the same, or similar, benchmark indices. Accordingly, rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income, subject to the impact of interest rate floors embedded in substantially all of our loans. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate floor for our loan portfolio was 1.60 . As of September 30, 2024, 99.8 of our loans by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest, subject to the impact of embedded interest rate floors, and were financed with liabilities that require interest payments based on floating rates. As of September 30, 2024, less than 6.0 of our floating rate liabilities contain an interest rate floor greater than zero. The weighted average interest rate floor for our floating rate mortgage loan liabilities was 0.11 as of September 30, 2024. 
 The following table illustrates the impact on our interest income and interest expense, for the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024, of an immediate increase or decrease in the underlying benchmark interest rate of 25, 50 and 75 basis points on our existing floating rate loans held for investment portfolio and related liabilities (dollars in thousands):

 __________________________ 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024, all of our floating rate mortgage loan assets and all of our floating rate mortgage loan liabilities were subject to Term SOFR as the benchmark interest rate. 
 (2) Floating rate liabilities include secured credit agreements, a secured revolving credit facility, asset-specific financing arrangements, and collateralized loan obligations. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our loans are also subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and other investments depend upon the sponsors ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, the asset management team reviews our portfolio and maintains regular contact with borrowers, co-lenders and local market experts to monitor the performance of the underlying collateral, anticipate borrower, property and market issues and, to the extent necessary or appropriate, enforce our rights as the lender. 
 In addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate market, including variances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control. We seek to manage these risks through our underwriting and asset management processes. 
 Prepayment Risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, causing the return on certain investments to be less than expected. Generally, declining interest rates result in increasing prepayment speeds. As we receive prepayments of principal on our assets, any premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums, which reduces the interest income earned on the assets, and accelerates the accretion into interest income of purchase discounts, which increases interest income. Increasing prepayment speeds may expose us to the risk that we cannot reinvest loan repayment proceeds promptly in suitable loan investments or other investments, which may cause investment income to decline.

Table of Contents 

 Extension Risk 
 Our Manager computes the projected weighted average life of our assets based on assumptions regarding the pace at which individual borrowers will prepay the mortgages or extend. If prepayment speeds decrease in a rising interest rate environment or extension options are exercised, the life of our loan investments could extend beyond the term of the secured debt agreements we use to finance our loan investments, except for our CRE CLOs for which the obligation to repay liabilities is tied to the repayment of underlying loans held by the CRE CLO trust. We expect that higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to rein in inflation may lead to a decrease in prepayment speeds and an increase in the number of our borrowers who exercise extension options. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In some situations, we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. 
 Non-Performance Risk 
 In addition to the risks related to fluctuations in cash flows and asset values associated with movements in interest rates, there is also the risk of non-performance on floating rate assets. In the case of a significant increase in interest rates, the additional debt service payments due from our borrowers may strain the operating cash flows of the collateral real estate assets and, potentially, contribute to non-performance or, in severe cases, default. This risk is partially mitigated by various factors we consider during our underwriting and loan structuring process, including but not limited to, establishing interest reserves in our loans and requiring substantially all of our borrowers to purchase an interest rate cap contract for all, or substantially all, of the initial term of our loan. 
 Loan Portfolio Value 
 We may in the future originate loans that earn a fixed rate of interest on unpaid principal balance. The value of fixed rate loans is sensitive to changes in interest rates. We generally hold all of our loans to maturity, and do not expect to realize gains or losses on any fixed rate loan we may hold in the future, as a result of movements in market interest rates during future periods. 
 Real Estate Risk 
 The market values of commercial mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. 
 Operating and Capital Market Risks 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings including margin calls, fund and maintain investments, pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs. Our liquidity risk is principally associated with our financing of longer-maturity investments with shorter-term borrowings in the form of secured credit agreements. We are subject to margin call risk under our secured credit agreements. In the event that the value of our assets pledged as collateral decreases due to an other-than-temporary decline in the value of the collateral securing our pledged loan, margin calls relating to our secured credit agreements could increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Additionally, if one or more of our secured credit agreement counterparties chooses not to provide ongoing funding, we may be unable to replace the financing through other lenders on favorable terms or at all. As such, we provide no assurance that we will be able to roll over or replace our secured credit agreements as they mature from time to time in the future. We maintain frequent dialogue with the lenders under our secured credit agreements regarding our management of their collateral assets. 
 In some situations, we have in the past, and may in the future, decide to sell assets to adjust our portfolio construction or maintain adequate liquidity. Market disruptions may lead to a significant decline in transaction activity in all or a significant portion of the asset classes in which we invest and may at the same time lead to a significant contraction in short-term and long-term debt and equity funding sources. A decline in market liquidity of real estate-related investments, as well as a lack of availability of observable transaction data and inputs, may make it more difficult to sell assets or determine their fair values. As a result, we may be unable to sell investments, or only be able to sell investments at a price that may be materially different from the fair values presented. Also, in such conditions, there is no guarantee that our borrowing arrangements or other arrangements for obtaining leverage will continue to be available or, if available, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us.

 Capital Markets Risk 
 We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under secured credit agreements, secured revolving credit facilities, collateralized loan obligations, mortgage loans, term loans, or other debt instruments or arrangements. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of capital we raise. 
 Global macroeconomic conditions, including, without limitation, heightened inflation, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, sustained higher interest rates, structural shifts and regulatory changes to the commercial banking systems of the U.S. and Western Europe, currency fluctuations, and labor shortages, have contributed to increased volatility in public debt and equity markets, increased cost of funds and reduced availability of efficient debt capital, factors which caused us to moderate our investment activity in 2023 and throughout 2024, and may cause us to restrain our investment activity in the future. 
 Counterparty Risk 
 The nature of our business requires us to hold our cash and cash equivalents with, and obtain financing from, various financial institutions. This exposes us to the risk that these financial institutions may not fulfill their obligations to us under these various contractual arrangements. We seek to mitigate this exposure by depositing our cash and cash equivalents and entering into financing agreements with what we believe to be high credit-quality institutions. 
 The nature of our loans and other investments also exposes us to the risk that our counterparties do not make required interest and principal payments on scheduled due dates. We seek to manage this risk through a comprehensive credit analysis prior to making an investment, rigorous monitoring of the underlying collateral during the term of our investments, and active asset management to protect our security interest in our collateral. 
 Currency Risk 
 We may in the future hold assets denominated in foreign currencies, which would expose us to foreign currency risk. As a result, a change in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on the valuation of our assets, as well as our income and distributions. Any such changes in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the measurement of such assets or income for the purposes of our REIT tests and may affect the amounts available for payment of dividends on our common stock. 
 We intend to hedge any currency exposures in a prudent manner. However, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amount of payments received on the related investments and/or unequal, inaccurate or unavailability of hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 We may hedge foreign currency exposure on certain investments in the future by entering into a series of forwards to fix the U.S. dollar amount of foreign currency denominated cash flows (interest income, rental income and principal payments) we expect to receive from any foreign currency denominated investments. Accordingly, the notional values and expiration dates of our foreign currency hedges would approximate the amounts and timing of future payments we expect to receive on the related investments.
