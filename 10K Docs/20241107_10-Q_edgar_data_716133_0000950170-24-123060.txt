million was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the write-off of certain fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets that will no longer be utilized as a result of the Company's decision in the third quarter to no longer pursue an ancillary product offering.

million related to the physical loss and damage claims and recorded the amount to "Other income, net" on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s Hawaiian Telcom subsidiary, along with many other parties, including governmental entities, landowners, utilities and other telecommunication providers, has been named as a defendant in multiple civil lawsuits brought by individual plaintiffs, a putative class, and subrogation plaintiffs in state and federal court in Hawaii arising out of the August 2023 windstorm and wildfires on the island of Maui. Among other things, the lawsuits allege that the defendants were responsible for, and/or were negligent in failing to prevent, the wildfires that led to severe destruction of property and loss of life. Hawaiian Telcom has denied any responsibility for the damages caused by the wildfires. The parties to the litigations, including Hawaiian Telcom, have engaged in confidential mediation and discussions regarding a global settlement of the litigations. On August 2, 2024, the defendants, individual plaintiffs, and class plaintiffs entered into a term sheet that contemplates a global resolution of all claims arising out of the August 2023 windstorm and wildfires on Maui that does not include any admission of liability in which the defendants would collectively pay an aggregate of billion. The settlement also would resolve all claims among the defendants. Hawaiian Telcom s contribution is a total of million and includes the million previously contributed for the One Ohana Fund. Settlement payments are expected to be made no earlier th an the fourth quarter of 2025 following necessary judicial review and approvals. However, until final settlement documents are signed by all the parties to the term sheet, there can be no assurances that a settlement will be completed, or that Hawaiian Telcom will be able to settle the lawsuits against it on the terms set forth in the term sheet . If the settlement is not completed, Hawaiian Telcom intends to vigorously defend the lawsuits in which it is named as defendant. As a result, the Company concluded that, with the agreement to the term sheet related to the August 2023 wildfires on Maui, the global settlement was probable, and the related loss was reasonably estimable. Accordingly, the Company recognized an incremental liability of million recorded to Other Noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024. This charge is offset by an insurance receivable included in Other noncurrent assets as of June 30, 2024. The Company recorded a general claims liability of million related to the matter as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the general liability of million related to this matter remains recorded in "Other noncurrent liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a general liability recorded related to this matter of million, of which million was recorded in "Other current liabilities" and million was recorded in "Other noncurrent liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 an offsetting receivable of million associated with amounts expected to be reimbursed by insurance has been recorded in "Other noncurrent assets," in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had recorded million to "Other noncurrent assets" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Legal expenses of million related to this matter have been recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income and Operating Taxes million. The tax benefit reported is lower than the million benefit expected at the statutory rate due most notably to additional federal and state valuation allowances recorded against net operating loss deferred tax assets. The tax benefit reported in the three months ended September 30, 2024 for continuing operations is lower than the tax benefit in the comparable period of 2023 for continuing operations, despite a higher loss before tax, due to additional valuation allowances recorded against net operating loss deferred tax assets.

million, despite a loss before tax of million, due most notably to amounts recorded related to the accounting for the planned divestiture of the Disposal Group. A discrete tax expense item of million has been recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for continuing operations to record a deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the difference between book basis and tax basis of the Disposal Group. In addition, million of tax expense, of which million was discrete, was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to increase valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. In the comparable period of 2023, the tax effect of the difference between book basis and tax basis of the Disposal Group was not yet reported.

million. The Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, although there can be no assurance that the Purchase Agreement will close by that date. Management evaluated the criteria to report a disposal group as held for sale and concluded that all of the criteria were met as of February 2024. As a result, the Company reported, and continues to report, the assets and the liabilities that are included in the Disposal Group as held for sale and the operations as discontinued starting in the first quarter of 2024. The revenue and operating income contributed by Hawaii operations and certain Communications customers, as well as the associated assets and liabilities, that were previously reported in the IT Services and Hardware Segment that will be retained by the continuing operation and excluded from the Disposal Group have been reported in the Network segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. All depreciation and amortization expense associated with intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right of use assets associated with the Disposal Group ceased as of February 2, 2024.

million, consisting of million in cash and million in contingent consideration. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company remitted the million of contingent consideration. The Company accounted for the Bridgewired fiber asset acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805-10-55 Business Combinations because the assets acquired do not include an assembled workforce, and the gross value of the assets acquired meets the screen test in ASC 805-10-55-5A related to substantially all of the fair value being concentrated in a single asset or group of assets (i.e., the fiber infrastructure assets) and, thus, the assets are not considered a business. The fiber network assets will help to support and expand the Company's existing network. The assets are recorded as network equipment in Property, plant and equipment, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Acquisition of Ohio Transparent Telecom Inc. On April 17, 2023 ("OTT Acquisition Date"), the Company acquired of Ohio Transparent Telecom Inc. ("OTT"), a private company that provides network security, data connectivity, and unified communications solutions to commercial and enterprise customers across multiple sectors throughout Ohio and Michigan for a n aggregate purchase price of million, consisting of million in cash and million in contingent consideration. The services and solutions provided by OTT will complement the services offered by Agile, which the Company acquired in the second quarter of 2022. The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on estimated fair values at the OTT Acquisition Date. The allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflects various fair value estimates and analyses, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists. The determination of the final purchase price allocation to specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed is complete. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded goodw ill of million attributable to an acquired workforce with industry expertise in addition to other expected synergies with Agile. The amount of goodwill related to this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes. Acquisition of Lawrenceburg Fiber Assets In the first quarter of 2023, the Company acquired fiber network assets from the City of Lawrenceburg for an aggregate purchase price of million consisting of million in cash and million in contingent consideration. The Company accounted for the Lawrenceburg fiber asset acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805-10-55 Business Combinations because the assets acquired do not include an assembled workforce, and the gross value of the assets acquired meets the screen test in ASC 805-10-55-5A related to substantially all of the fair value being concentrated in a single asset or group of assets (i.e., the fiber infrastructure assets) and, thus, the assets are not considered a business. The fiber network assets will help to support and expand the Company's existing network. The assets are recorded as network equipment in Property, plant and equipment, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

and automatically renew on a month-to-month basis. Customers are invoiced on a monthly basis for services rendered. Contracts for projects that are included within the Other revenue stream are typically short in duration and less than one year. Contracts associated with the SEA-US cable system typically range from to and payment is prepaid. The Company has elected the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-32-18 that allows an entity to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects that the period of time between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for such good or service will be one year or less. Customers are typically billed immediately upon the rendering of services or the delivery of products. Payment terms for customers are between and days. Subsequent to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom Holdco., Inc. ("Hawaiian Telcom"), the Company began recognizing a financing component associated with the up-front payments for services to be delivered under indefeasible right of use ("IRU") contracts for fiber circuit capacity. The IRU contracts typically have a duration ranging from to . Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, or a series of distinct goods or services, and is the unit of account defined in ASC Topic 606. The transaction price identified in the contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract modifications for changes to services provided are routine throughout the term of our contracts. In most instances, contract modifications are for the addition or reduction of services that are distinct, and price changes are based on the stand-alone selling price of the service and, as such, are accounted for on a prospective basis as a new contract. Goods and services are sold individually, or a contract may include multiple goods or services. For contracts with multiple goods and services, the transaction price identified in the contract is allocated to each performance obligation using the stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Performance obligations are satisfied either over time as services are performed or at a point in time. Substantially all of our service revenue is recognized over time. For services transferred over time, the Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize revenue based on amounts invoiced to the customer as the Company has concluded that the invoice amount directly corresponds with the value of services provided to the customer. Management considers this a faithful depiction of the transfer of control as services are provided evenly over the month and are substantially the same over the life of the contract. As the Company has elected the practical expedients detailed at ASC 606-10-50-13, revenue for these unsatisfied performance obligations that will be billed in future periods has not been disclosed.

million. In the third quarter of 2024 the Company was awarded a contract of million to subsidize broadband expansion in Southwest Ohio. The revenue is expected to be recognized in 2026 and 2027. Certain IRU contracts extend for periods of up to years and are invoiced at the beginning of the contract term. The revenue from such contracts is recognized over time as services are provided over the contract term. ended December 31, 2024

Thereafter 

Network The Company has identified four distinct performance obligations in the Network segment, namely Data, Video, Voice and Other. For each of the Data, Video and Voice services, service is delivered to the customer continuously and in a substantially similar manner for each period of the agreement, the customer takes full control over the services as the service is delivered, and as such, Data, Video and Voice are identified to be a series of distinct services. Services provided by the Network segment can be categorized into three main categories that include Strategic, Legacy and Other. The Strategic and Legacy categories may include one or more of the aforementioned performance obligations. Data services include internet access, digital subscriber lines, ethernet, routed network services, SONET (Synchronous Optical Network), dedicated internet access, wavelength, digital signal, IRU revenue and revenue associated with the SEA-US cable system. Video services are offered through our fiber network to residential and commercial customers based on various standard plans with the opportunity to add premium channels. To receive video services, customers are required to use the Company's set top boxes that are billed as part of the monthly recurring service. Set top boxes are not considered a separate performance obligation from video because the equipment is necessary for the service to operate and the customer has no alternative use for the equipment. Voice services include traditional and fiber voice lines, switched access, digital trunking, consumer and business long distance calling, and, as a result of the Purchase Agreement, certain communications services including data and VoIP services, tailored solutions that include converged IP communications of data, voice and mobility applications, MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) and conferencing services. Services and products not included in Data, Voice or Video are included in Other revenue and are comprised of wire care, time and materials projects, advertising, management of distributed antenna systems, certain pass through fees such as franchise fees and regulatory fees, subsidized fiber build projects and other fees that are generally nonrecurring in nature. As a result of the Purchase Agreement, Other revenue also includes revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom for the sale of hardware and maintenance contracts as well as installation projects and cloud services which include storage, SLA-based monitoring and management, cloud computing and cloud consulting. The sale of hardware and maintenance contracts is recognized at a point in time while transfer of control of the other services and products is evaluated on an individual project basis and can occur over time or at a point in time. The Company uses multiple methods to determine stand-alone selling prices in the Network segment. For Internet products categorized as Strategic, included within the Data performance obligation, and Video, market rate is the primary method used to determine stand-alone selling prices. For Enterprise Fiber products categorized as Strategic, included within the Data performance obligation, and Voice, Legacy Data and Other performance obligations, stand-alone selling prices are determined based on a list price, discount off of list price, a tariff rate, a margin percentage range, or a minimum margin percentage. For the sale of hardware, the Company evaluated whether it is the principal or the agent. The Company has concluded it acts as an agent because it does not control the inventory before it is transferred to customers, it does not have the ability to direct the product to anyone besides the purchasing customer, and it does not integrate the hardware with any of its own goods or services. Based on this assessment, the performance obligation is to arrange a sale of hardware between the vendor and the customer. In the instance where there is an issue with the hardware, the Company coordinates with the manufacturer to facilitate a return in accordance with the standard manufacturer warranty. Hardware returns are not significant to the Company. For hardware sales, revenue is recognized net of the cost of product and is recognized when the hardware is either shipped or delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract. For certain projects within Voice and Other, revenue is recognized when the customer communicates acceptance of the services performed. For contracts with freight on board shipping terms, management has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good, and, therefore, has not evaluated whether shipping and handling activities are promised services to its customers.

million incremental increase to the existing Term B-2 Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (the Incremental Term B-2 Loans and (ii) the extension of the maturity date for the commitments under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility to . The Incremental Term B-2 Loans are part of the same class of Loans as the existing Term B-2 Loans and have the same terms as such Term B-2 Loans. The proceeds of the Incremental Term B-2 Loans were used (a) to repay the outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) to repay a portion of borrowings under the Company s accounts receivable securitization facility, (c) to pay fees, expenses and other transaction costs related to Amendment No. 3 and the transactions contemplated thereby and (d) for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The other material terms, conditions and covenants of the Credit Agreement were unchanged by Amendment No. 3. As a result of Amendment No.3, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of million related to the Incremental Term B-2 Loans and capitalized the amounts as a reduction to the outstanding debt balance. In addition, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of million relat ed to the extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to August 2028 and capitalized the amounts to "Other noncurrent assets" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. In June 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the "Amendment No. 4") to the Credit Agreement to provide for a reduction in the interest rate margin applicable to the Term B-3 Loans under the Credit Agreement. The other material terms, conditions and covenants of the Credit Agreement were unchanged by Amendment No. 4. As a result of Amendment No. 4, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of million related to the Term B-3 Loans and capitalized the amounts as a reduction to the outstanding debt balance. The May and June 2024 amendments were accounted for as modifications of the original Term Loan B-2 and Revolving Credit Facility. Accordingly, no loss was recorded and new financing costs deferred are being amortized over the new and amended maturities of the term loan and revolver. The Company had million of outstanding borrowings on the Credit Agreement s revolving credit facility, leaving million available for borrowings as of September 30, 2024. T he revolving credit facility matures in , and the Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans and Term B-3 Loans under the Credit Agreement mature in . Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the Network Receivables Facility, leaving million remaining availability on the total borrowing capacity of million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the CBTS Receivables Facility, leaving million remaining availability on the total borrowing capacity of million. The maximum borrowing limit for loans and letters of credit under the Network Receivables Facility and the CBTS Receivables Facility is million and million, respectively, in the aggregate. The available borrowing capacity on each facility is calculated monthly based on the quantity and quality of outstanding accounts receivable, and thus may be lower than the maximum borrowing limit. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company executed an amendment to the CBTS Receivables Facility to extend the renewal date of the facility to April 2025 and replace CDOR, the benchmark rate of interest for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, with the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average ("CORRA"). As a result of the amendment, borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars under the CBTS Receivables Facility will bear interest based on CORRA plus . All other material terms and conditions of the CBTS Receivables Facility were unchanged by the amendment. In October 2024, the Company executed an amendment to the Network Receivables Facility that extended the renewal date of the facility to April 2025. All other material terms and conditions of the Network Receivables Facility were unchanged by the amendment. The Network Receivables Facility and the CBTS Receivables Facility have a termination date in January 2026. Under the Network Receivables Facility and the CBTS Receivables Facility, certain U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, as originators, sell their respective trade receivables on a continuous basis to Cincinnati Bell Funding LLC CBF ), Cincinnati Bell Funding Canada Ltd. ("CBFC"), or CBTS Funding LLC CBTSF ), wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. Although CBF, CBFC and CBTSF are wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Company, CBF, CBFC and CBTSF are legally separate from the Company and each of the Company s other subsidiaries. Upon and after the sale or contribution of the accounts receivable to CBF, CBFC or CBTSF, such accounts receivable are legally assets of CBF, CBFC and CBTSF and, as such, are not available to creditors of other subsidiaries or the parent company. The CBTS Receivables Facility includes an option for CBTSF to sell, rather than borrow against, certain receivables on a non-recourse basis. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance for accounts receivable sold.

The interest rate swaps expire in . In the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements to limit exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt. The interest rate caps each have a cap rate of with notional amounts of million and million and deferred premiums of million and million, respectively. The deferred premiums will be paid on a monthly basis over the term of the respective interest rate cap. The interest rate caps expire in . The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are impacted by the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has agreements with its derivative financial instrument counterparties that contain provisions providing that if the Company defaults on the indebtedness associated with its derivative financial instruments, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative financial instruments obligations. In addition, the Company minimizes nonperformance risk on its derivative instruments by evaluating the creditworthiness of its counterparties, which are limited to major banks and financial institutions. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and records all mark-to-market adjustments directly to Other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values of the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are based on well-recognized financial principles and available market data.

Disclosure on Financial Instruments The carrying values of the Company's financial instruments approximate the estimated fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, except for the Company's long-term debt and other financing arrangements. 

Other financing arrangements 

The fair value of our long-term debt was based on closing or estimated market prices of the Company s debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which is considered Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the other financing arrangements was calculated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates current borrowing rates for obligations of similar duration, which is considered Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, the current borrowing rate was estimated by applying the Company's credit spread to the risk-free rate for a similar duration borrowing.

noncontributory defined benefit plans and a postretirement health and life insurance plan in Cincinnati (collectively, the "Cincinnati Plans"), and one noncontributory defined benefit plan for union employees and two postretirement health and life insurance plans for Hawaiian Telcom employees (collectively, the "Hawaii Plans"). In the third quarter of 2024, the Company purchased a group annuity contract to transfer a portion of its pension liability and related responsibility for benefit payments of certain participants and beneficiaries within our existing defined benefit plans. Additionally, lump sum payments of million resulting in a reduction of the benefit obligation of million were made in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a pension settlement gain of million in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the annuity purchases and the lump sum payments to the plan participants exceeding the sum of the service cost and the interest cost component of the net pension cost for each of the pension plans. In the second quarter of 2024, the Hawaii defined benefit plan for union employees made lump sum payments of million resulting in a reduction of the benefit obligation of million. The Company recorded a pension settlement gain of million in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of the lump sum payments to the plan participants exceeding the sum of the service cost and the interest cost component of the net pension cost. On December 31, 2023, the cash balance pension plan for nonunion employees ("HTMPP") under the Hawaii plans was merged into the management pension plan ("CBMPP") under the Cincinnati Plans. Pension plan assets and liabilities in the HTMPP were transferred to the CBMPP and remeasured at December 31, 2023. In accordance with ASC 715, only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization, which was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Introduction 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis section provides an overview of Cincinnati Bell Inc. s financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes as well as the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Results for interim periods may not be indicative of results for the full year or any other interim period. 
 Sale of IT Services Business 
 On February 2, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with TowerBrook Capital Partners ("TowerBrook") in which TowerBrook will acquire the CBTS and OnX businesses from the Company for a purchase price of 670.0 million (the "Divestiture"). The Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, although there can be no assurance that the Purchase Agreement will close by that date. 
 altafiber Brand 
 In March 2022, the Company announced that we would begin doing business as altafiber in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana as we continue to expand our geographic reach and invest in our fiber network that delivers broadband connectivity. The branding change will not impact our Hawaiian Telcom business. 
 Executive Summary 
 Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ("altafiber," "Cincinnati Bell," "we," "our," "us" or the "Company") provide integrated communications that keep consumer and enterprise customers connected with each other and with the world. Through our Network segment, the Company provides Data, Video, and Voice solutions to consumer and enterprise customers over an expanding fiber network and a legacy copper network. 
 Consolidated revenue totaling 274.7 million and 819.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 million and decreased 5.4 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Strategic revenue increased 16.6 million and 43.5 million, respectively, compared to the comparable periods in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the Strategic Internet subscriber base. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Strategic revenue growth more than offset Legacy decline of 14.5 million compared to the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Legacy revenue decline of 44.3 million and decreased Other revenue of 4.6 million, compared to the comparable period in the prior year, more than offset Strategic revenue growth. Other revenue decreased primarily due to Hawaii hardware sales and revenue associated with nonrecurring subsidized fiber build projects. 
 27 

Operating loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.3 million and 12.3 million, respectively, compared to operating loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 15.3 million and 62.5 million, respectively. Lower operating loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 is primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization expenses due to certain assets that were given a shorter useful life when recorded at fair value on the Company's merger date, September 7, 2021, and were fully depreciated by March 31, 2023, as well as declining amortization expense on certain intangibles. Operating loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes an asset impairment charge of 3.1 million related to assets that will no longer be utilized by the business related to an ancillary product offering that the Company decided to no longer pursue in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Interest expense increased 3.5 million and 14.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to interest expense incurred on the Incremental Term B-2 Loans entered into in the second quarter of 2024. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 are also impacted by the Term B-3 Loans entered into in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by decreased borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility due 2028 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Other components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the annual remeasurement of the pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations that resulted in decreased expense due to lower interest cost on projected benefit obligations and increased benefit from expected return on plan assets as well as a settlement gain recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Settlement gain is the result of the Company purchasing a group annuity contract and transferring a portion of its pension liability and the related responsibility for benefit payments within existing defined benefit plans as well as lump sum payments. 
 Other expense (income), net totaled expense of 20.4 million and income of 16.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to recording losses associated with the Company's interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements of 20.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and gains of 6.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a patronage distribution of 6.1 million from one of the syndicated lenders of the Term B-1 Loans and Term B-3 Loans in the Company's Credit Agreement and received insurance reimbursements of 3.0 million related to the physical loss and damage claims filed as a result of the wildfires in Hawaii. 
 Other expense (income), net totaled income of 14.1 million and 38.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to recording gains associated with the Company's interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements of 14.1 million and 33.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a patronage distribution of 5.0 million from one of the syndicated lenders of the Term B-1 Loans and Term B-3 Loans in the Company's Credit Agreement. 
 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes totaled 71.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulting in an increase in the loss of 26.7 million compared to the same period in 2023 as the decrease in operating loss was more than offset by the unfavorable change to other expense (income), net and higher interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes totaled 125.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting in a decrease in the loss of 18.8 million compared to the same period in 2023 as the decrease in operating loss and favorable change to other (expense) income, net more than offset higher interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for continuing operations was a benefit of 1.0 million. The tax benefit reported is lower than the 14.9 million benefit expected at the statutory rate due most notably to additional federal and state valuation allowances recorded against net operating loss deferred tax assets. The tax benefit reported in the three months ended September 30, 2024 for continuing operations is lower than the tax benefit in the comparable period of 2023 for continuing operations, despite a higher loss before tax, due to additional valuation allowances recorded against net operating loss deferred tax assets. 
 The income tax provision recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for continuing operations was an expense of 30.2 million, despite a loss before tax of 125.0 million, due most notably to amounts recorded related to the accounting for the planned divestiture of the Disposal Group. A discrete tax expense item of 17.1 million has been recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for continuing operations to record a deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the difference between book basis and tax basis of the Disposal Group. In addition, 44.5 million of tax expense, of which 20.3 million was discrete, was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to increase valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. In the comparable period of 2023, the tax effect of the difference between book basis and tax basis of the Disposal Group was not yet reported.

Network 
 The Network segment provides products and services that are categorized as Strategic, Legacy or Other. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company realigned the classification of products and services to these categories within the Network segment to better align revenue across geographies as well as reclass certain nonrecurring revenue to Other. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC ("CBT"), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier ("ILEC") for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for over 150 years. In 2022, the Company announced that we will be doing business as "altafiber" and started our network expansion outside of this territory to provide fiber services to adjacent markets. Voice and data services that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC ("CBET"), a subsidiary of CBT. On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full-service provider of communications services and products in the state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of over 140 years as Hawaii s communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii s major islands, with recent expansion of its video service from Oahu to all neighboring islands. On May 2, 2022, the Company acquired Agile, based in Canton, Ohio. Agile leases wireless infrastructure assets to third parties and provides connectivity through hybrid fiber wireless data networks primarily to customers in Ohio and Pennsylvania. On April 17, 2023, the Company acquired Ohio Transparent Telecom Inc. ("OTT"). OTT provides network security, data connectivity, and unified communications solutions to commercial and enterprise customers across multiple sectors throughout Ohio and Michigan. 
 As a result of the Purchase Agreement, revenue contributed by Hawaii operations and certain Communications revenue previously reported in the IT Services and Hardware segment are now reported in the Network segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Strategic products include internet access for speeds that meet or exceed 100 megabits per second and Enterprise Fiber, each categorized below as Data, as well as video. The Company is able to deliver speeds of up to one gigabit per second to nearly 80 of the Cincinnati ILEC operating territory and approximately 58 of Hawaii s total addressable market. Enterprise Fiber products include metro-ethernet, dedicated internet access, wavelength, IRU contracts, connectivity services provided by Agile, and wireless backhaul to macro-towers and small cells. Hawaiian Telcom Enterprise Fiber revenue also includes revenue from the SEA-US cable system. As enterprise customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the preferred method of transport due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection. 
 Legacy products include internet access for speeds of less than 100 megabits per second, traditional voice lines, consumer and business long distance, switched access, digital trunking, DSL, DS0, DS1, DS3 and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return. As a result of the Purchase Agreement, Legacy products also include certain communications services including data and VoIP services, tailored solutions that include converged IP communications of data, voice and mobility applications, MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) and conferencing services. 
 Other revenue is comprised of wire care, time and materials projects, advertising, management of distributed antenna systems, certain pass through fees such as franchise fees and regulatory fees, other fees that are not billed on a monthly recurring basis, and subsidized fiber build project revenue related to extending the Company s fiber network in the Greater Cincinnati territory subsidized through our UniCity program and in Hawaii subsidized through a customer contract. As a result of the Purchase Agreement, Other revenue also includes revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom for the sale of hardware and maintenance contracts as well as installation projects and cloud services which include storage, SLA-based monitoring and management, cloud computing and cloud consulting.

Strategic 
 Strategic revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 16.6 million and 43.5 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the increase in the subscriber base for internet. The internet subscriber base continues to increase as we focus attention on growing the strategic internet subscriber base adding 28,100 strategic internet subscribers in Cincinnati and 13,000 strategic internet subscribers in Hawaii in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In Hawaii, we continue to build fiber at an accelerated pace which enabled us to pass 15,800 and 45,000 FTTP addresses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In Cincinnati, we passed 5,300 and 23,200 FTTP addresses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily to multi-dwelling units and in markets adjacent to Cincinnati. The Average Revenue Per User ARPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased for internet in both Cincinnati and Hawaii compared to the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to price increases and more customers subscribing to higher broadband tiers. 
 Enterprise Fiber revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.0 million and 3.4 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increased revenue in Hawaii of 2.3 million and 5.9 million, respectively, associated with an IRU contract and the SEA-US cable system. In addition, revenue was favorably impacted in each geography as a result of customers migrating from legacy product offerings to higher bandwidth fiber solutions as evidenced by the 24 and 31 increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively. In Cincinnati, further increases in revenue were contributed by Agile of 1.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by decreased revenue as a result of pricing pressures to provide higher speeds at a lower cost. 
 Legacy 
 Legacy revenue decreased 14.5 million and 44.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the decline in voice lines and internet subscribers. Voice lines declined 8 in both Cincinnati and Hawaii as the traditional voice lines become less relevant. Legacy internet subscribers continue to decrease in Cincinnati and Hawaii as subscribers demand the higher speeds that can be provided by fiber. In addition, declines in DS1, DS3 and digital trunking have contributed to the Legacy revenue decline for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 as customers migrate away from these solutions to fiber-based solutions. 
 Other 
 Other revenue decreased 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year as decreased revenue from subsidized fiber build projects of 2.5 million was partially offset by increased revenue from miscellaneous billing fees of 1.0 million. 
 Other revenue decreased 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to decreased revenue from subsidized fiber build projects of 6.1 million and Hawaii hardware sales of 5.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from professional services projects of 4.0 million, miscellaneous billing increases of 1.7 million, and nonrecurring rent revenue billing adjustments of 1.0 million.

Network, continued 
 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of services and products decreased 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in network related expenses of 1.9 million related to the decommissioning of certain copper assets as customers continue to migrate from copper-based services to fiber-based services. These decreases were partially offset by increases in operating taxes of 1.4 million due to higher regulatory fees. 
 Cost of services and products decreased 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to decreases in network related expenses of 4.3 million and operating materials of 2.2 million, which more than offset increases in operating taxes of 3.4 million and contract services costs of 1.6 million due to similar trends that impacted the quarter. The increase in contract services costs are due to higher utilization of outside contractors on certain specialized projects including the expansion of our fiber network. 
 SG A expenses increased 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in the prior year primarily due to increases in contract services costs, software development expenses and bad debt expense partially offset by decreased advertising costs due to reduced marketing campaigns and promotional events. 
 SG A expenses decreased 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as favorable advertising expenses of 2.9 million due to similar trends that impacted the quarter and decreased payroll costs of 1.8 million were partially offset by increases in contract services costs of 2.0 million and software development expenses of 1.2 million. The decrease in payroll related costs is primarily due to headcount reductions made during restructuring initiatives that were executed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Increased contract services costs is due to legal expenses and general liability insurance expenses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the wildfires in Hawaii that exceeded the favorable insurance adjustment recorded in the period while software development expenses increased due to higher software support fees. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 8.1 million and 53.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to certain assets that were given a shorter useful life when recorded at fair value on the Company's merger date, September 7, 2021, and were fully depreciated by March 31, 2023 in addition to declining amortization expense on certain intangibles. 
 Restructuring and severance related charges of 0.7 million related to contract terminations and impairment of assets charges of 3.1 million related to fixed assets that will no longer be utilized by the business were recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024. These charges were recorded as a result of the Company decision to no longer pursue an ancillary product offering in the third quarter of 2024.

Capital expenditures in Cincinnati are incurred to expand our fiber network, upgrade and increase capacity for our networks, and to maintain our fiber and copper networks. The Company is focused on building FTTP addresses, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we passed 5,300 and 23,200 FTTP addresses, respectively, primarily in markets adjacent to Cincinnati as well as multi-dwelling units. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is able to deliver internet speeds up to one gigabit or more to 814,800 residential and commercial addresses, or nearly 80 of our ILEC operating territory in Cincinnati. 
 
 Cincinnati construction capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 33.2 million and 63.4 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to passing fewer doors in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Cincinnati installation capital expenditures increased 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher costs to install. 
 
 Enterprise Fiber capital expenditures in Cincinnati are related to success-based fiber builds, including associated equipment, for enterprise and carrier projects to provide ethernet services as well as network refresh projects that ensure we continue to grow our capacity and services within the network core. Cincinnati Enterprise Fiber capital expenditures increased 1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased capital expenditures of 4.7 million relating to network capacity upgrades, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures contributed by Agile of 3.1 million. Cincinnati Enterprise Fiber capital expenditures increased 5.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased network capacity upgrades that impacted the quarter and increased capital expenditures contributed by Agile of 1.4 million. Cincinnati capital expenditures classified as Other are related to IT projects, cable and equipment maintenance and capacity additions, real estate upgrades and maintenance, plus other minor capital purchases. 
 
 Hawaii construction capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 5.8 million and 9.2 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the timing of capital expenditures, which does not necessarily coincide with the timing of when addresses become available. Hawaii installation capital expenditures decreased 5.0 million and 8.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the timing of expenditures for customer premise equipment CPE utilized for installations and lower costs to install in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Enterprise Fiber capital in Hawaii is primarily driven by new ethernet customers as well as upgrades to Ethernet Bandwidth for large carriers across the network due to significant contracts signed in 2022 and 2023. Hawaii capital expenditures classified as Other include IT projects, real estate projects, road jobs or plant damage projects, and network upgrades or optimization projects.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 487.4 million and 2,093.8 million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding capital leases and other financing arrangements of 9.5 million that are reported as held for sale at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s primary source of cash is generated by operations. The Company generated 185.7 million and 59.2 million of cash flows from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 303.2 million of short-term liquidity, comprised of 4.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, 2.3 million of cash and cash equivalents included in "Current assets held for sale from discontinued operations," 280.0 million of undrawn capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility due 2028, 9.4 million available under the Network Receivables Facility and 6.9 million available under the CBTS Receivables Facility. 
 The Network Receivables Facility and CBTS Receivables Facility permit maximum borrowings of up to 55.0 million and 225.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowings of 20.6 million and 25.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Network Receivables Facility on a borrowing capacity of 55.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowings of 208.4 million and 0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the CBTS Receivables Facility on a borrowing capacity of 215.5 million. 
 Capacity on the Network Receivables Facility and the CBTS Receivables Facility is calculated and will continue to be calculated based on the quantity and quality of outstanding accounts receivables. Therefore if the Company experiences declines in revenue or extends discounts to customers, the capacity could be negatively impacted and reduce our short term liquidity. While we expect to continue to renew the Network Receivables Facility and CBTS Receivables Facility, we would be required to use cash, our Revolving Credit Facility due 2028, or other sources to repay any outstanding balances on the facilities if they were not renewed. 
 In May 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the "Amendment No. 3") to the Credit Agreement to provide for (i) a 300 million incremental increase to the existing Term B-2 Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (the Incremental Term B-2 Loans and (ii) the extension of the maturity date for the commitments under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility to August 2028. The Incremental Term B-2 Loans are part of the same class of Loans as the existing Term B-2 Loans and have the same terms as such Term B-2 Loans. The proceeds of the Incremental Term B-2 Loans were used (a) to repay the outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) to repay a portion of borrowings under the Company s accounts receivable securitization facility, (c) to pay fees, expenses and other transaction costs related to Amendment No. 3 and the transactions contemplated thereby and (d) for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The other material terms, conditions and covenants of the Credit Agreement were unchanged by Amendment No. 3. 
 In June 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the "Amendment No. 4") to the Credit Agreement to provide for a reduction in the interest rate margin applicable to the Term B-3 Loans under the Credit Agreement. The other material terms, conditions and covenants of the Credit Agreement were unchanged by Amendment No. 4. 
 One of the syndicated lenders of the Term B-1 Loans and Term B-3 Loans in the Credit Agreement is a cooperative bank owned by its customers. Annually, this bank distributes patronage in the form of cash and stock in the cooperative based on the Company s average outstanding loan balance. The Company will recognize the patronage, generally as declared, in Other income, net. The stock component will be recognized at its stated cost basis. The Company received 6.1 million and 5.0 million in patronage dividends in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Company s primary uses of cash are for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service and, to a lesser extent, to fund pension and retiree medical obligations. The Company believes that cash on hand, operating cash flows, its Revolving Credit Facility due 2028, its Network Receivables Facility and CBTS Receivables Facility, and the expectation that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations as they mature and come due, should allow the Company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants and ratios.

Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 185.7 million, an increase of 126.5 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to changes in the amount of accounts receivable sold on the CBTS Receivables Facility which resulted in increased cash flows of 40.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 in addition to increased cash inflow due to improved working capital associated with the Disposal Group and 18.0 million of realized gains on the Company's interest rate hedges and caps, an increase of 6.0 million compared to same period in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by higher interest payments of 15.5 million primarily due to higher interest rates and restructuring payments of 12.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 associated with initiatives executed in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to payments of 1.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 415.2 million, a decrease of 78.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to the decrease in capital expenditures primarily associated with extending the Company's fiber network, decrease in acquisition of assets and insurance reimbursements of 3.0 million received in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the physical loss and damage claims filed as a result of the wildfires in Hawaii. 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 230.4 million primarily due to the issuance of 300.0 million of Incremental Term B-2 Loans which was partially offset by net payments on the Revolving Credit Facility due 2028 and receivables facilities of 32.5 million and 16.6 million, respectively and required payments totaling 11.7 million on the Term B-1, B-2 and B-3 Loans. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 432.4 million primarily due to a capital contribution from Parent of 400.0 million, the issuance of 200.0 million of Term B-3 Loans and net borrowings on the receivables facilities of 58.9 million. These increases were partially offset by net payments on the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 of 187.0 million and the repayment of the remaining 22.3 million outstanding principal amount of its 7 1 / 4 Notes due 2023 upon the maturity date of the notes in the second quarter of 2023.

Regulatory Matters 
 Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a complete description of regulatory matters. There are no material changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Contingencies 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various regulatory and tax proceedings, lawsuits, claims and other matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been made for all such asserted and unasserted claims in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments. 
 The Company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 The adoption of new accounting standards did not have a material impact on the Company s financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Furthermore, accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Leg al Proceedings 
 Cincinnati Bell and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Liabilities are established for legal claims when losses associated with the claims are judged to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many lawsuits and arbitrations, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of the liability until the case is close to resolution, in which case a liability will not be recognized until that time. Based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, available insurance coverage and recognized liabilities, the Company believes that except as otherwise described in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q the eventual outcome of all claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a comprehensive listing of the Company s risk factors. There are no material changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Eq uity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None. 
 Item 3. Defaults u pon Senior Securities

 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure 
 None.
