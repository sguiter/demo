units, including
 units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, at per unit (the Units ),
which is discussed in Note 4, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement of private units (the Private Units at a price of 
per Private Unit in a private placement, generating gross proceeds to the Company of , of which has not been funded
and was recorded as subscription receivable, which is described in Note 5. 

Transaction costs amounted to consisting
of of underwriting commissions, of deferred underwriting commissions, and of other offering costs (including
 of offering costs reimbursed by the underwriters) and was allocated between Class A common stock subject to possible redemption,
Public Warrants, Private Placement Shares, and Private Placement Warrants. 

The Company must complete one or more initial
Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined
below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the
signing a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete such Business
Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete
a Business Combination successfully. 

Following the closing of the IPO on November 19,
2021, per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Units was deposited
into a trust account (the Trust Account ), located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company
acting as trustee, which may only be invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16)
of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. To mitigate the risk that
the Company might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, on December 28, 2023 we instructed
the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing
demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or our liquidation. Except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay tax obligations and up to to pay
dissolution expenses, the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Shares will not be released from the Trust Account until the
earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the Company s redemption of of the outstanding public shares if
it has not completed a Business Combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which the Company completes a Business Combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration
to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

per Public Share. 

All of the Public Shares contain a redemption
feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder
vote or tender offer in connection with the initial Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

In accordance with SEC and its guidance on redeemable
equity instruments, which has been codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require common stock subject to
redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares were issued with Public Warrants, the initial carrying
value of common stock classified as temporary equity was then allocated proceeds determined in accordance with FASB ASC 470-20. The Public
Shares are subject to FASB ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option
to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable
that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the
redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of
each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately as they occur, measured at the end of each reporting
period. 

The initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and
directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights
with respect to any shares of Class B common stock, par value (the Founder Shares ), Private Placement Shares and
Public Shares they hold in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with
respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares they hold in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to any Founder Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period
or during any Extension Period (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any
Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame). 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable
to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective
target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business
Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the
actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per
Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any
claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account
(whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of
the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to
reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy
its indemnity obligations, and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the
Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.

, of which was funded on April 2, 2024, and was
funded on April 10, 2024. On April 10, 2024, the Company remitted to Internal Revenue Service for its income tax liability and
 (net of accrued interest) to Delaware Department of State for its franchise tax liability. The Sponsor s working capital
loan also replenished the Company s operating account to maintain the remaining difference of between amounts withdrawn
from the Trust Account and remitted to the tax authorities, which will be used solely for payment of its income and Delaware franchise
tax obligations. The Company continues to incur further tax liabilities and intends to cover such liabilities from the funds in its operating
account and, if necessary, from additional financing from the Sponsor, without additional withdrawals from the Trust Account, until the
excess of the funds withdrawn from the Trust Account over the amounts remitted to the government authorities is cured. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank
account and working capital deficit of approximately million. of the amount of cash on hand as of June 30, 2024 relate to
the amounts that were withdrawn from the Trust for payment of income and Delaware Franchise Taxes and can not be used for any other purpose. 

In addition, the Company has in a
subscription receivable, which will be used to satisfy the Company s liquidity needs. The Company s liquidity needs prior
to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the cash contribution of from the Sponsor to purchase
Founder Shares (as defined in Note 6), and an advance from the Sponsor of approximately (see Note 6). The Company repaid 
on November 19, 2021 and the remaining remains outstanding and is due on demand. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial
Public Offering, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public
Offering, over-allotment and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. Over this time period, the Company will be using
the funds outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business
Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target
business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction
costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans, as defined below (see Note 6). As of June 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the liquidity condition and the mandatory
liquidation date raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made
to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after November 19, 2024 upon the approval
of the extension of the liquidation date at the special shareholder meeting on May 17, 2024. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company
intends to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal excise
tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded
foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its
stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased
at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the
fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition,
certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority
to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any share redemption or other
share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject
to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination,
extension vote or otherwise will depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases
in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and
amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection
with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and
other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder,
the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available
on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. 

On April 20, 2023, the Company s stockholders

a liability can range from probable to remote. A contingent liability must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate
treatment. Management has evaluated the requirements of the IR Act and the Company s operations at the end of the reporting period

days after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination and months from the closing of the IPO and will
expire after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier
upon redemption or liquidation. 

The Company is not registering the shares of Class
A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, the Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file
with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants
and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified
in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not
effective by the th business day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there
is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement,
exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding
the above, if the Company s shares of Class A common stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national
securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities
Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis 
in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to
file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, the Company will use its best efforts
to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding
warrants: 

in whole and not in part; at a price of per warrant; upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption (the 30-day redemption period); and if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

If the Company calls the warrants for redemption
as described above, the management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless
basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the management
will consider, among other factors, the Company s cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect
on the stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants. In such
event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied
by the excess of the fair market value (as defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market
value. The fair market value shall mean the average last reported sale price of shares of the Class A common stock for the
 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. 

The Company accounts for the warrants
that would be issued in connection with the IPO (including the Public Warrants included in the Units and the Private
Placement Warrants included in the Private Units) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that
the warrants meet the criteria for equity treatment due to the existence of provisions whereby adjustments to the exercise price of the
warrants is based on a variable that is an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed option and no circumstances under
which the Company can be forced to net cash settle the warrants.

on May 20, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar
business combination with one or more businesses. 

On November 19, 2021, we consummated our IPO of
30,000,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 300 million. 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we
consummated the private placement of 1,350,000 private units for an aggregate purchase price of 13,500,000. 

Upon the closing of our IPO on November 19, 2021,
 306,000,000 10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the sale of private shares
were placed in the Trust Account. 

If we are unable to complete the initial business
combination on or before the current termination date or and extended date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of
winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding public
shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us but net of taxes payable (and less up to 100,000 of interest
to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public
stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable
law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and
our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to
provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
our initial business combination will be successful. 

Recent Developments

of the Company to convert its shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis
at any time and from time to time at the election of the holder. The newly issued Class A common stock would not have any redemption rights

the warrants of the Company. Pursuant to Rule 15c2-11 (the Exchange Act ), the submission of Form 211 to the FINRA OTC Compliance
Unit enables broker-dealers to initiate or resume trading quotes on the pink sheets by OTC Markets Group Inc. for securities
not listed on the New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. The securities are expected to be quoted on the Pink Sheets,
but there can be no assurance if or when this will occur. 

On May 17, 2024, the Company held a special meeting
of its stockholders (the May 17 Special Meeting ). At the May 17 Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved

was 10,901,760 and 6,646,080 as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

SEE ID Business Combination Agreement

parties, including, among others, a registration statement of Holdings becoming effective and approval of the Business Combination by
the stockholders of ShoulderUp and SEE ID. 

Results of Operations 

Our entire activity from inception up to June
30, 2024, was for our formation and preparation for our IPO, and subsequent to the IPO, identifying a target company for a business combination.
We will not generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024,
we had net loss of approximately 0.2 million, which consisted of the general and administrative expenses of approximately 330,000,
change in fair value of derivative liability of approximately 24,000, franchise tax expense of approximately 1,400 and income tax expense
of approximately 49,000, offset by income from investments held in the Trust Account and operating account of approximately 230,000. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023,
we had net income of approximately 855,000, which consisted of income from investments held in the Trust Account and operating account
of approximately 1.5 million, offset by general and administrative expenses of approximately 272,000, franchise tax expense of approximately
 50,000, change in fair value of derivative liability of 30,000 and income tax expense of approximately 308,000. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, we
had net loss of approximately 0.6 million, which consisted of the general and administrative expenses of approximately 690,000, change
in fair value of derivative liability of approximately 272,000, franchise tax expense of approximately 51,000 and income tax expense
of approximately 93,000, offset by income from investments held in the Trust Account and operating account of approximately 492,135. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had
net income of approximately 3.2 million, which consisted of income from investments held in the Trust Account and operating account
of approximately 4.8 million, offset by general and administrative expenses of approximately 478,000, franchise tax expense of approximately
 100,000, change in fair value of derivative liability of 30,000 and income tax expense of approximately 987,000. 

Liquidity and Going Concern Consideration 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 290,466
in its operating bank account and working capital deficit of approximately 4.6 million. The amounts of cash on hand as of June 30, 2024
relate to the amounts that were withdrawn from the Trust for payment of income and Delaware Franchise Taxes and can not be used for any
other purpose. 

In addition, we have 600,000 in subscription
receivable, which will be used to satisfy our liquidity needs. Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering
were satisfied through the cash contribution of 25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase Founder Shares, and an advance from the Sponsor of
approximately 29,000. We repaid 24,000 on November 19, 2021 and the remaining 5,000 remains outstanding and is due on demand. Subsequent
to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of
the Initial Public Offering, over-allotment and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. Over this time period, the Company
will be using the funds outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial
Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

Of the net proceeds from the IPO and associated
Private Placements, 306,000,000 of cash was placed in the Trust Account and 1,656,890 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account
and was available for the Company s working capital purposes. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with
a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans, as defined below. As of June 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working
Capital Loans. On April 2, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note to the Sponsor for working capital needs in the amount of 275,000,
of which 175,000 was funded on April 2, 2024, and 100,000 was funded on April 10, 2024. 

22 

Assessment of Going Concern Considerations 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the liquidity condition, mandatory liquidation
and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have
been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate November 19, 2024. The unaudited
Condensed Consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. The Company intends to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. Over this time period,
the Company will be using the funds outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, and completing the proposed Business
Combination with SEE ID pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. 

Franchise and Income Tax Withdrawals from Trust
Account 

Since completion of its IPO on November 19, 2021,
and through December 31, 2023, the Company withdrew 2,636,344 from the Trust Account to pay its liabilities related to the income and
Delaware franchise taxes. Through December 31, 2023, the Company remitted 2,224,486 to the respective tax authorities, which resulted
in remaining excess of funds withdrawn from the Trust Account, but not remitted to the government authorities of 411,858. Additionally,
as of June 30, 2024, the Company had accrued but unpaid income tax liability of 132,576 and unpaid liability for the Delaware franchise
tax of 48,800, As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 290,466 in its operating account and inadvertently used 76,954 of the funds withdrawn
from the Trust Account for payment of other operating expenses not related to taxes. Based on review of the circumstances above, management
determined that this use of funds was not in accordance with the Trust Agreement. 

On April 2, 2024, the Sponsor committed to providing
the Company a working capital loan in the amount of 275,000, of which 175,000 was funded on April 2, 2024, and 100,000 was funded on
April 10, 2024. On April 10, 2024 the Company remitted 261,072 to Internal Revenue Service for its income tax liability and 38,800 (net
of accrued interest) to Delaware Department of State for its franchise tax liability. The Sponsor s working capital loan also replenished
the Company s operating account to maintain the remaining difference of 71,985 between amounts withdrawn from the Trust Account
and remitted to the tax authorities, which will be used solely for payment of its income and Delaware franchise tax obligations. The Company
continues to incur further tax liabilities and intends to cover such liabilities from the funds in its operating account and, if necessary,
from the proceeds from the promissory note to Sponsor, without additional withdrawals from the Trust Account, until the excess of the
funds withdrawn from the Trust Account over the amounts remitted to the government authorities is cured. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of these unaudited Condensed Consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The only
item that involves critical accounting estimates is non-redemption agreements derivative liability. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have
concluded that as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the following material weaknesses
identified in our internal controls over financial reporting identified as of December 31, 2023, which remained non remediated as of
June 30, 2024: 

a material weakness
 in internal controls related to failures in reporting period closing that could lead to misstatement of the Company s liabilities
 arising from complex financial instruments; 

a material weakness in internal controls related to the compliance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement related to the use of funds withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of tax liabilities. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes to our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

23 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Except as set forth below, as of the date of this
Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect
on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
may also impair our business or results of operations. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company,
we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for
us to complete a business combination. 

A company that, among other things, is or holds
itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or
holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, as amended, or the Investment
Company Act. Since we will invest the proceeds held in the Trust Account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act.
To this end, the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only in United States government securities within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule
3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act. To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes
of the Investment Company Act, on December 28, 2023 we instructed the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account
and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation
of our initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, we
would likely receive less interest on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders
will receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. 

If we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete
a business combination, including: 

restrictions on the nature of our investments; and 

restrictions on the issuance of securities. 

In addition, we may have imposed upon us certain
burdensome requirements, including: 

registration of an investment company; 

adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and 

adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and 

adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and 

reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. Compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On November 19, 2021, we sold 30,000,000 units,
including 3,500,000 units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, at a purchase price of 10.00
per unit in our initial public offering (the IPO ). Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated
the private placement of 1,350,000 private shares for an aggregate purchase price of 13,500,000 (the Private Placement ).
Following the closing of the IPO and the Private Placement on November 19, 2021, 306,000,000 10.20 per unit) from the net proceeds
of the sale of the units in the IPO and the sale of the private placement units was deposited into our trust account (the Trust
Account ), and 1,656,890 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account and is available for the Company s working capital
purposes. Transaction costs (other than deferred underwriting commissions) amounted to 6,620,368 consisting of 5,300,000 of underwriting
commissions, and 1,320,368 of other offering costs (including 795,000 of offering costs reimbursed by the underwriters). 

The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account
are invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
