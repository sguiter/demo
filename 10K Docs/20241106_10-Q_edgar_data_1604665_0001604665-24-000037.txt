 common units representing limited partner interests. 
 In connection with the IPO, the Partnership acquired a limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo") and a interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo GP LLC ("OpCo GP"), which is the general partner of OpCo. OpCo owns ethylene production facilities and common carrier ethylene pipeline (collectively, the "Contributed Assets"). Since the IPO, the Partnership has periodically purchased additional limited partner interest in OpCo. Most recently, on March 29, 2019, the Partnership purchased an additional newly-issued limited partner interest in OpCo for approximately , resulting in an aggregate limited partner interest in OpCo, effective January 1, 2019. The remaining limited partner interest in OpCo is owned by Westlake Corporation. 
 limited partner interest and the entire non-economic general partner interest in OpCo. The remaining limited partner interest in OpCo is owned directly by Westlake, which has no rights to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of OpCo. As a result of the fact that substantially all of OpCo's activities are conducted on behalf of Westlake, and the fact that OpCo exhibits disproportionality of voting rights to economic interest, OpCo was deemed to be a variable interest entity. The Partnership, through its ownership of OpCo's general partner, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of OpCo, and it also has the obligation or right to absorb losses or receive benefits from OpCo that could potentially be significant to OpCo. As such, the Partnership was determined to be OpCo's primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates OpCo's results of operations and financial position. The Partnership's operations consist exclusively of the variable interest entity's operations and, as such, no additional variable interest entity disclosures are considered necessary. Westlake's retained interest of is recorded as noncontrolling interest in the Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 
 In the opinion of the Partnership's management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair statement of the Partnership's financial position as of September 30, 2024, its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the changes in its cash position for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Results of operations and changes in cash position for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that will be realized for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 or any other interim period. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

As a result of the Partnership's decision to postpone the previously announced maintenance turnaround at the Petro 1 facility from the third quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, OpCo's production is anticipated to result in "excess quantities" of ethylene for the current contract year. Therefore, Net sales Westlake was reduced by during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with charges to Westlake, under the Ethylene Sales Agreement, for certain non-variable costs of production subject to reimbursement related to the "excess quantities".

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Westlake Chemical Partners LP's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"), as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this report to "we," "our," "us" or like terms, refer to Westlake Chemical Partners LP (the "Partnership"), Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo") and Westlake Chemical OpCo GP LLC ("OpCo GP"). References to "Westlake" refer to Westlake Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries other than the Partnership, OpCo GP and OpCo. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please read "Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of limitations inherent in such statements. 
 Partnership Overview 
 We are a Delaware limited partnership formed by Westlake to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. On August 4, 2014, we closed our initial public offering (the "IPO") of 12,937,500 common units. In connection with the IPO, we acquired a 10.6 interest in OpCo and a 100 interest in OpCo GP, which is the general partner of OpCo. On April 29, 2015, we purchased an additional 2.7 newly-issued limited partner interest in OpCo, resulting in an aggregate 13.3 limited partner interest in OpCo effective April 1, 2015. The 12,686,115 subordinated units of the Partnership, all of which were previously owned by Westlake, were converted into common units of the Partnership on August 30, 2017. On September 29, 2017, we completed a secondary public offering of 5,175,000 common units and purchased an additional 5.0 newly-issued limited partner interest in OpCo, resulting in an aggregate 18.3 limited partner interest in OpCo effective July 1, 2017. On March 29, 2019, we completed a private placement of 2,940,818 common units and used the net proceeds to purchase an additional 4.5 interest in OpCo, effective January 1, 2019, resulting in us owning an aggregate 22.8 limited partner interest in OpCo. 
 Currently, our sole revenue generating asset is our 22.8 limited partner interest in OpCo, a limited partnership formed by Westlake and us in anticipation of the IPO to own and operate an ethylene production business. We control OpCo through our ownership of its general partner. Westlake retains the remaining 77.2 limited partner interest in OpCo as well as a significant interest in us through its ownership of our general partner, 40.1 of our limited partner units (consisting of 14,122,230 common units) and our incentive distribution rights. OpCo's assets include (1) two ethylene production facilities ("Petro 1" and "Petro 2" and, collectively, "Lake Charles Olefins") at Westlake's Lake Charles, Louisiana site; (2) one ethylene production facility ("Calvert City Olefins") at Westlake's Calvert City, Kentucky site; and (3) a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline (the "Longview Pipeline") that runs from Mont Belvieu, Texas to Westlake's Longview, Texas facility. 
 How We Generate Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily by selling ethylene and the resulting co-products we produce. OpCo and Westlake have entered into an ethylene sales agreement (the "Ethylene Sales Agreement") pursuant to which we generate a substantial majority of our revenue. The Ethylene Sales Agreement is a long-term, fee-based agreement with a minimum purchase commitment and includes variable pricing based on OpCo's actual feedstock and natural gas costs and estimated other costs of producing ethylene (including OpCo's estimated operating costs and a five-year average of OpCo's expected future maintenance capital expenditures and other turnaround expenditures based on OpCo's planned ethylene production capacity for the year), plus a fixed margin per pound of 0.10 less revenue from co-products sales. Pursuant to the Ethylene Sales Agreement, Westlake's obligation to pay for the annual minimum commitment (95 of OpCo's budgeted ethylene production), which is measured on an annual basis, is not reduced for a force majeure event lasting fewer than 45 consecutive days. In the event of a force majeure event, we recognize buyer deficiency fees representing fixed margin and unavoided operating and maintenance capital expenditures and maintenance expenses per pound of volume committed by Westlake during the force majeure period. In the event Westlake purchases less than its annual commitment, we recognize buyer deficiency fees representing fixed margin and all expenses and expenditures incurred per pound of volume committed but not taken by Westlake. Payment for the buyer deficiency fee is scheduled to be received by the Partnership after the conclusion of the year. 
 Westlake has an option to take 95 of volumes in excess of the minimum commitment on an annual basis under the Ethylene Sales Agreement if we produce more than our planned production. Under the Ethylene Sales Agreement, the price for the sale of such excess ethylene to Westlake is based on a formula similar to that used for the minimum purchase commitment, with the exception of certain fixed costs. Under the Ethylene Sales Agreement, if we produce more than our planned production in a contract year, we reimburse Westlake for certain non-variable costs that were charged on excess quantities of ethylene produced and sold to Westlake. Such reimbursement is scheduled to be paid by the Partnership after the conclusion of the year.

Table of Contents 

In addition, under the Ethylene Sales Agreement, if production costs billed to Westlake on an annual basis are less than 95 of the actual production costs incurred by OpCo during the contract year, OpCo is entitled to recover the shortfall in such production costs (proportionate to the volume sold to Westlake) in the subsequent year ("Shortfall"). The Shortfall is generally recognized during the period in which the related operating, maintenance or turnaround activities occur.

 Our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and turnaround costs. Our operating expenses are comprised primarily of feedstock costs and natural gas, labor expenses (including contractor services), utility costs (other than natural gas) and turnaround and maintenance expenses. With the exception of feedstock (including natural gas) and utilities-related expenses, operating expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of production volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the circumstances, particularly maintenance and turnaround activities. Our maintenance capital expenditures and turnaround costs are comprised primarily of maintenance of our ethylene production facilities and the amortization of capitalized turnaround costs. These capital expenditures relate to the maintenance and integrity of our facilities. We capitalize the costs of major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected facility. We plan to commence the next planned maintenance turnaround at Petro 1 in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and turnaround costs are built into the price per pound of ethylene charged to Westlake under the Ethylene Sales Agreement. Because the expenses other than feedstock costs and natural gas are based on forecasted amounts and remain a fixed component of the price per pound of ethylene sold under the Ethylene Sales Agreement for any given 12-month period, our ability to manage operating expenses, maintenance expenditures and turnaround costs may directly affect our profitability and cash flows. The impact on profitability is partially mitigated by the fact that we generally recognize any Shortfall as revenue in the period such costs and expenses are incurred. We seek to manage our operating and maintenance expenses on our ethylene production facilities by scheduling maintenance and turnarounds over time to avoid significant variability in our operating margins and minimize the impact on our cash flows, without compromising our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. In addition, we reserve cash on an annual basis from what we would otherwise distribute to minimize the impact of turnaround costs in the year of incurrence. The purchase price under the Ethylene Sales Agreement is not designed to cover capital expenditures for expansions.

MLP Distributable Cash Flow and EBITDA 
 The body of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is commonly referred to as "GAAP." For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that (1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or (2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. We use the non-GAAP measures of MLP distributable cash flow and EBITDA to analyze our performance. We define distributable cash flow as net income plus depreciation, amortization and disposition of property, plant and equipment, less contributions for turnaround reserves, maintenance capital expenditures and mark-to-market adjustment on derivative contracts. We define MLP distributable cash flow as distributable cash flow less distributable cash flow attributable to Westlake's noncontrolling interest in OpCo and distributions attributable to the incentive distribution rights holder. MLP distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We use each of MLP distributable cash flow and EBITDA to analyze our performance. Fees for a buyer deficiency and Shortfall are included in net income in the periods in which they are recognized. MLP distributable cash flow and EBITDA are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded partnerships; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
 MLP distributable cash flow is not a substitute for the GAAP measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities. MLP distributable cash flow has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA is not a substitute for the GAAP measures of net income, income from operations and net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, it should be noted that companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented for us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes. Reconciliations for each of MLP distributable cash flow and EBITDA are included in the " Results of Operations" section below.

Net sale s for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 47.7 million as compared t o net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to lower ethylene sales prices to Westlake, partially offset by higher ethylene and co-products sales volumes and prices to third parties and higher ethylene sales volumes to Westlake during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared t o the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 Net Sales. Total net sales decreased by 44.7 million, or 13.9 , to 277.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 321.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net sales in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to lower ethylene sales volumes and prices to Westlake in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher ethylene and co-products sales volumes and prices to third parties. Lower average sales prices in the third quarter of 2024 contributed to a 15.1 decrease in net sales compared to the third quarter of 2023. Higher sales volumes in the third quarter of 2024 contributed to a 1.2 increase in net sales compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to 116.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 93.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin percentage in the third quarter of 2024 was 42.2 , as compared to 28.9 for the third quarter of 2023. The higher gross profit margin was primarily due to lower ethane feedstock costs and natural gas prices in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was also positively affected by insurance recoveries of approximately 6.2 million related to the settlement of a business interruption claim associated with Hurricane Laura, which impacted OpCo's Petro 1 and Petro 2 facilities in the second half of 2020 and impacted production in the subsequent periods. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.6 million, or 9.0 , to 7.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 6.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to a higher provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Interest Expense Westlake. Interest expense of 6.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased from 6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 mainly due to higher interest rates on the debt balance outstanding in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Other Income, net . Other income, net remained consistent at 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2023.

MLP Distributable Cash Flow. MLP distributable cash flow increased by 4.3 million to 17.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 13.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior-year period, was primarily attributable to increased earnings at OpCo and lower maintenance capital expenditures, partially offset by higher reserves for future turnarounds. 
 EBITDA. EBITDA increased by 23.4 million to 139.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 115.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher ethylene and co-products sales volumes and prices to third parties and lower ethane feedstock costs and natural gas prices in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by lower ethylene sales volumes and prices to Westlake. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was also positively impacted by insurance recoveries of approximately 6.2 million related to the settlement of a business interruption claim associated with Hurricane Laura, which impacted OpCo's Petro 1 and Petro 2 facilities in the second half of 2020 and impacted production in the subsequent periods. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Sales. Total net sales decreased by 47.7 million, or 5.3 , to 845.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 893.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower ethylene sales prices to Westlake, partially offset by higher ethylene sales volumes to Westlake and higher ethylene and co-products sales volumes and prices to third parties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as co mpared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower average sales prices in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 contributed to a 7.9 decrease in net sales compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The higher sales volumes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 contributed to a 2.6 increase in net sales as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to 320.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 286.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Gross profit margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.9 , as compared to 32.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher sales prices and volumes to third parties and lower ethane feedstock costs and natural gas prices in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses of 21.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comparable to selling, general and administrative expenses of 21.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

 Other Income, net . Other income, net increased by 0.7 million to 3.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher interest earned on the balance with Westlake under the Investment Management Agreement due to higher market interest rates as well as a higher average amount of cash invested in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 MLP Distributable Cash Flow. MLP distributable cash flow increased by 5.7 million to 51.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 46.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior-year p eriod, was primarily attributable to increased earnings at OpCo, partially offset by higher reserves for future turnarounds. 
 EBITDA. EBITDA increased by 36.9 million to 386.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 349.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher ethylene and co-products sales volumes and prices to third parties, higher ethylene sales volumes to Westlake and lower ethane feedstock costs and natural gas prices during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by lower ethylene sales prices to Westlake.

CASH FLOW DISCUSSION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities provided cash of 352.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 344.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The 8.2 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to lower cash used for turnaround activity compared to the first nine months of 2023. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for the purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, net Westlake, accounts receivable, net third parties, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets less accounts payable Westlake, accounts payable third parties and accrued and other liabilities, provided cash of 1.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 39.5 million of cash provided in the first nine months of 2023, resulting in an overall unfavorable change of 38.3 million. The unfavorable change in working capital was mainly attributable to unfavorable changes in net accounts receivable Westlake, accounts payable third parties and accrued and other liabilities. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable, net Westlake was primarily due to a smaller buyer deficiency fee and Shortfall collected in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by changes in the payable with Westlake due to fluctuating ethane feedstock costs. Unfavorable changes in accounts payable third parties and accrued and other liabilities were due to the timing of payment of accruals and the impact of the Calvert City Olefins turnaround activities on these balances in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 50.5 million as compared to net cash used for investing activities of 53.1 million in the first nine months of 2023, resulting in an overall favorable change of 2.6 million in investing cash flows. During the first nine months of 2024, there were net investments with Westlake of 15.0 million under the Investment Management Agreement, whereas during the first nine months of 2023, there were net investments with Westlake of 19.1 million under the Investment Management Agreement. Capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2024 were slightly higher than the first nine months of 2023. For both the comparative periods, these capital expenditures were primarily related to projects to increase production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance costs and safety and environmental projects at our facilities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 300.4 million as compared to net cash used for financing activities of 290.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. The cash outflows in the first nine months of 2024 were related to distributions of 250.6 million to the noncontrolling interest retained in OpCo by Westlake and of 49.8 million to unitholders by the Partnership. The cash outflows in the first nine months of 2023 were related to distributions of 240.3 million to the noncontrolling interest retained in OpCo by Westlake and of 49.8 million to unitholders by the Partnership. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity and Financing Arrangements 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, entered in October 2018 and amended in February 2020, among the Partnership and various investment banks, the Partnership may offer and sell the Partnership's common units from time to time to or through the investment banks, as the Partnership's sales agents or as principals, having an aggregate offering amount of up to 50.0 million (the "ATM Program"). The Partnership intends to use the net proceeds of sales of the common units, if any, for general partnership purposes, which may include the funding of potential drop-downs and other acquisitions. No common units had been issued under the ATM Program as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the terms of our cash distribution policy, we expect that we will distribute to our partners most of the excess cash generated by our operations. To the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flow to fund capital expenditures, we expect to fund them primarily from external sources, including borrowing directly from Westlake, as well as future issuances of equity interests or debt. 
 The Partnership maintains separate bank accounts, but Westlake continues to provide treasury services on our behalf under the Omnibus Agreement. Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, the OpCo Revolver, the MLP Revolver and, if necessary and possible under then current market conditions, the issuance of additional equity interests or debt. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions. Westlake may also provide other direct and indirect financing to us from time to time, although it is not obligated to do so.

Table of Contents 

In order to fund non-annual turnaround expenditures, we cause OpCo to reserve an amount for turnaround costs during each twelve-month period designed to cover future turnaround activities. Each of OpCo's ethylene production facilities requires turnaround maintenance approximately every five years. By reserving additional cash annually, we intend to reduce the variability in OpCo's cash flow. Although we had previously planned to commence the next maintenance turnaround at the Petro 1 ethylene unit in the third quarter of 2024, we made the decision to defer the planned turnaround in order to maintain production and capitalize on higher average third-party ethylene sales prices during the second half of 2024. We expect to commence the next planned maintenance turnaround at Petro 1 in the first quarter of 2025. Westlake's purchase price for ethylene purchased under the Ethylene Sales Agreement includes a component (adjusted annually) designed to cover, over the long term, substantially all of OpCo's turnaround expenditures. 
 Our cash is generated from cash distributions from OpCo. OpCo is a restricted subsidiary under certain indentures governing Westlake's senior notes, and these restrictions limit OpCo's ability to, among other things, incur additional debt. Westlake's credit facility and various indentures do not prevent OpCo from making distributions to us. 
 We, OpCo and Westlake are parties to an Investment Management Agreement that authorizes Westlake to invest the Partnership's and OpCo's excess cash with Westlake for durations of up to a maximum of nine months. Per the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, cash invested with Westlake earns a market return plus five basis points and Westlake provides daily availability of the invested cash to meet any liquidity needs of the Partnership or OpCo. 
 On October 30, 2024, the board of directors of Westlake Chemical Partners GP LLC, our general partner, approved a quarterly distribution of 0.4714 per unit payable on November 27, 2024 to unitholders of record as of November 12, 2024, which equates to a total amount of approximately 16.6 million per quarter, or approximately 66.4 million per year in aggregate, based on the number of common units outstanding on September 30, 2024. We do not have a legal or contractual obligation to pay distributions on a quarterly basis or any other basis at our minimum quarterly distribution rate or any other rate. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Westlake has historically funded expansion capital expenditures related to Lake Charles Olefins and Calvert City Olefins. No such funding was required by OpCo during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Total capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 35.5 million and 34.0 million, respectively. We expect that Westlake will loan additional cash to OpCo to fund its expansion capital expenditures in the future, but Westlake is under no obligation to do so. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 60.2 million. In addition, we have cash invested under the Investment Management Agreement (as described below) and a revolving credit facility with Westlake available to supplement cash if needed, as described under "Indebtedness" below. 
 In August 2017, the Partnership, OpCo and Westlake executed the Investment Management Agreement that authorizes Westlake to invest the Partnership's and OpCo's excess cash with Westlake for durations of up to a maximum of nine months. Per the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Partnership earns a market return plus five basis points and Westlake provides daily availability of the invested cash to meet any liquidity needs of the Partnership or OpCo. The Partnership had 109.5 million of cash invested under the Investment Management Agreement at September 30, 2024. 
 Indebtedness 
 OpCo Revolver 
 In connection with the IPO, OpCo entered into a 600.0 million revolving credit facility with an affiliate of Westlake, as amended in June 2017, September 2018 and July 2022 (the "OpCo Revolver") that may be used to fund growth projects and working capital needs. The OpCo Revolver is scheduled to mature on July 12, 2027. On July 12, 2022, OpCo entered into the Second Amendment (the "OpCo Revolver Amendment") to the OpCo Revolver. The OpCo Revolver Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date to July 12, 2027 and provided for the replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("SOFR"). Borrowings under the OpCo Revolver bear interest at a variable rate of either (a) SOFR plus the Applicable Margin plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment or, if SOFR is no longer available, (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin minus 1.0 . The Applicable Margin under the OpCo Revolver is 1.75 . As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the OpCo Revolver totaled 22.6 million and bore interest at SOFR plus the Applicable Margin and credit spread adjustment, which is accrued in arrears quarterly.

 In 2015, we entered into a senior, unsecured revolving credit agreement with an affiliate of Westlake, as amended in August and November 2017, March 2020 and July 2022 (the "MLP Revolver"). The MLP Revolver has a borrowing capacity of 600.0 million and is scheduled to mature on July 12, 2027. On July 12, 2022, the Partnership entered into the Fourth Amendment (the "MLP Revolver Amendment") to the MLP Revolver. The MLP Revolver Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date to July 12, 2027 and provided for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate. Borrowings under the MLP Revolver bear interest at a variable rate of either (a) SOFR plus the Applicable Margin plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment or, if SOFR is no longer available, (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin minus 1.0 . The Applicable Margin under the MLP Revolver varies between 1.75 and 2.75 , depending on the Partnership's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The MLP Revolver provides that we may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. The MLP Revolver requires that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of either (1) during any one-year period following certain types of acquisitions (including acquisitions of additional interests in OpCo), 5.50:1.00 or less, or (2) during any other period, 4.50:1.00 or less. The MLP Revolver also contains certain other customary covenants. The repayment of borrowings under the MLP Revolver is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the MLP Revolver totaled 377.1 million and bore interest at SOFR plus the Applicable Margin and credit spread adjustment, which is accrued in arrears quarterly. We intend to use the MLP Revolver to purchase additional limited partnership interests in OpCo in the future, in the event OpCo desires to sell such additional interests to us, for other acquisitions and for general partnership purposes. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 None.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain of the statements contained in this report are forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "believes," "intends," "may," "should," "could," "anticipates," "expects," "will" or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategies or trends. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements relate to matters such as: 
 the amount of ethane that we are able to process, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating difficulties; 
 the volume of ethylene that we are able to sell; 
 the price at which we are able to sell ethylene; 
 industry market outlook, including prices and margins in third-party ethylene and co-products sales; 
 widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis; 
 the impact of ongoing supply chain constraints caused by the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine; 
 the parties to whom we will sell ethylene and on what basis; 
 volumes of ethylene that Westlake may purchase, in addition to the minimum commitment under the Ethylene Sales Agreement; 
 timing, funding and results of capital expenditures; 
 our intended quarterly distributions and the manner of making such distributions; 
 our ability to meet our liquidity needs; 
 timing of and amount of capital expenditures; 
 our At-the-Market program and the use of any net proceeds from any sales under that program; 
 our and OpCo's ability to extend our credit agreements with Westlake; 
 potential loans from Westlake to OpCo to fund OpCo's expansion capital expenditures in the future; 
 expected mitigation of exposure to commodity price fluctuations; 
 turnaround activities (such as our plan to commence Petro 1 turnaround in the first quarter of 2025) and the variability of OpCo's cash flow; 
 receipt of any buyer deficiency fee and Shortfall under the Ethylene Sales Agreement; 
 compliance with present and future environmental regulations and costs associated with environmentally related penalties, capital expenditures, remedial actions and proceedings, including any new laws, regulations or treaties that may come into force to limit or control carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions or to address other issues of climate change; 
 our ability to receive indemnification from Westlake for environmental and other losses; and 
 effects of pending legal proceedings.

Table of Contents 

We have based these statements on assumptions and analysis in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe were appropriate in the circumstances when the statements were made. Forward-looking statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such statements. These statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including those described under "Risk Factors" in the 2023 Form 10-K and the following: 
 general economic and business conditions, including inflation, interest rates and possible recession; 
 the cyclical nature of the chemical industry; 
 the availability, cost and volatility of raw materials and energy; 
 lower crude oil prices reducing the cost advantage of ethane-based ethylene producers; 
 actions taken by Westlake; 
 uncertainties associated with the United States and worldwide economies, including those due to political tensions and conflict in the Middle East and elsewhere, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; 
 uncertainties associated with pandemic infectious diseases; 
 uncertainties associated with climate change; 
 the potential impact on demand for ethylene due to initiatives such as recycling and customers seeking alternatives to polymers; 
 current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the United States and regulatory actions and political unrest in other countries, including environmental regulations; 
 industry production capacity and operating rates; 
 the supply/demand balance for our products; 
 competitive products and pricing pressures; 
 instability in the credit and financial markets; 
 access to capital markets; 
 terrorist acts; 
 operating interruptions (including leaks, explosions, fires, weather-related incidents, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, spills and releases and other environmental risks); 
 changes in laws or regulations; 
 technological developments; 
 information systems failures and cyberattacks; 
 our ability to implement our business strategies; and 
 creditworthiness of our customers. 
 Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Any of the factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance, and our actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward-looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels. Every forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 A substantial portion of the Partnership's products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. However, our direct exposure to commodity price risk is limited to approximately 5.0 of our total ethylene production, which is the portion sold to third parties. We believe we have substantially mitigated our indirect exposure to commodity price fluctuation during the term of the Ethylene Sales Agreement through the minimum purchase commitment and the cost-plus based pricing. Additionally, we may use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and ethylene associated with the production and sales to third parties. We did not have any open derivative position at September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our outstanding debt, all of which is variable rate debt. At September 30, 2024, we had variable rate debt of 399.7 million outstanding, all of which was owed to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Westlake. On July 12, 2022, OpCo entered into the OpCo Revolver Amendment. The OpCo Revolver Amendment, among other things, provided for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate. Borrowings under the OpCo Revolver bear interest at a variable rate of either (a) SOFR plus the Applicable Margin plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment or, if SOFR is no longer available, (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin minus 1.0 . The Applicable Margin under the OpCo Revolver is 1.75 . On July 12, 2022, the Partnership entered into the MLP Revolver Amendment. The MLP Revolver Amendment, among other things, provided for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate. Borrowings under the MLP Revolver bear interest at a variable rate of either (a) SOFR plus the Applicable Margin plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment or, if SOFR is no longer available, (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin minus 1.0 . The Applicable Margin under the MLP Revolver varies between 1.75 and 2.75 , depending on the Partnership's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The weighted average variable interest rate of our debt as of September 30, 2024 was 7.2 . We will continue to be subject to interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate debt as well as the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced. A hypothetical increase in our average interest rate on variable rate debt by 100 basis points would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 4.0 million, of which 3.8 million would relate to the MLP Revolver and 0.2 million would relate to the OpCo Revolver based on the September 30, 2024 debt balance. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective with respect to (i) the accumulation and communication to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we submit under the Exchange Act, and (ii) the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of such information within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings
