Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 The Company is subject to several risks associated with companies at a similar stage, including dependence on key individuals, competition from similar products and larger companies, volatility of the industry, ability to obtain adequate financing to support growth, the ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel to manage the anticipated growth of the Company, and general economic conditions including the current macro-economic conditions impacting the banking and financial markets.

 million, calculated, in part, based on the value of eligible accounts receivable assigned to Spectrum as security for advances under the Spectrum Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2024 , there w ere million o f advances outstanding under the Spectrum Loan Facili ty. At September 30, 2024 , thousand of excess collateral was due from Spectrum, which is included in accounts receivable on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5 for additional discussion on the Spectrum Loan Facility. 

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Co mpany had and thousand, respectively, of revenue from contracts with customers to be recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer. Certain nonrecurring engineering service revenues are recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did not have any contractual liabilities where performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there was rev enue recognized from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. 
 
 The costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling of materials used in its products are classified as cost of revenue in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. Any incidental items that are immaterial in the context of a sale to a customer are recognized as expense. 

and weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were and weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All warrants, options, and unvested restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for the periods presented. 

The following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of basic shares for th e three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 unaudited ), as th ey would be anti-dilutive: 

Common stock warrants 
 Restricted stock units 
 Stock options 

shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance, of which, shares have been designated as Series A convertible preferred stock , par value per share, which have a stated value of per share and are initially convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. Holders of the Series A convertible preferred stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the Company s common stockholders. The Company applies the accounting standards for distinguishing liabilities from equity when determining the classification and measurement of its preferred stock. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable preferred shares (including preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as stockholders equity. 
 
 The Company evaluates its convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with Topic 815 of the FASB ASC. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record embedded conversion options and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. The Company primarily uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the fair value of its warrants including those issued in connection with preferred stock. The Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulations include subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. 

million which was funded by cash on hand. The Company acquired all previously released components as well as new cores under development at Gallium Semiconductor. Additionally, all associated intellectual property (IP) has been transferred to the Company as part of this portfolio acquisition. By integrating these assets, the Company intends to significantly enhance its ongoing efforts to develop and commercialize a new line of GaN devices tailored for wireless infrastructure, military, and satellite communications applications. The Company did not acquire any employees or facilities. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC Topic 805. The Company recorded a definite-lived developed technology intangible asset of million that will be amortized over years. 
 
 shares of preferred stock raising million, net of transaction expenses. Additionally, the Company amended its loan facility (the 'Salem Loan Facility') with Salem Investment Partners V, Limited Partnership ('Salem') to (i) reduce the outstanding principal balance from million to million, (ii) extend the maturity date from January 31, 2026 to December 31, 2028, and (iii) reduce the interest rate from (comprising payment-in-kind (deferred) and cash) to cash. 
 
 Management has assessed the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the financial statement issuance date for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on the actions described above, management has determined the Company has alleviated the substantial doubt previously disclosed and has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations for the next twelve months. Based on cash on hand as of the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued, the Company believes it has sufficient cash to fund operations for at least twelve months after the issuance date.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360 - 10, Property, Plant, and Equipment. ASC 360 - 10 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals.

The Credit Agreement also allowed for additional borrowing in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) of the net amount of eligible inventory (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (ii) , and (iii) of th e purchased accounts receivable outstanding under the related Assignment of Accounts and Security Agreement (the AR Agreement ).

The term of the facility automatically renews for an additional two -year period unless either party provides at least 60 days notice prior to the expiration date. The term automatically renewed on June 1, 2024. In the event of an early termination of the AR Agreement by the Company or resulting from the Company s default or other circumstances impacting the Company (including bankruptcy, reorganization, sale of assets, and cessation of business), the Company will be required to pay a prepayment fee. 
 
 The Company s obligations under the Spectrum Loan Facility are secured by first -priority liens on essentially all of the Company s assets; provided, however, that the Company is permitted to grant purchase money security interests on certain equipment, furniture and similar tangible assets financed by a third party. 
 
 In addition to annual facility fees of and other quarterly and transaction fees payable to Spectrum, interest accrues on amounts owed under the Spectrum Loan Facility at the prime rate as quoted by the Wall Street Journal plus , but in no event lower than .

As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and restrictions.

Salem Loan Facility 
 
 On August 11, 2022, the Company entered into the Salem Loan Facility.

The Company agreed to issue up to an additional shares of common stock in the event Salem advanced the additional million. 
 
 On May 1, 2023, Salem made an additional advance of million to the Company. At the same time, the Company agreed to increase the interest rate for the Salem Loan Facility from to per annum, with payable monthly and payable either monthly or at maturity, with the outstanding principal and interest due in August 2027. In conjunction with the additional advance of million, the Company paid Salem a closing fee of thousand and issued shares of common stock to Salem. The million advance was allocated between notes payable, common stock and additional paid-in capital based on the relative fair value of the underlying common stock and had an approximate effective interest rate of . If the Company repays the loan during the first three years of the term, it is required to pay a prepayment premium equal to (i) of the prepaid principal during year 1, (ii) of the prepaid principal during year 2, and (iii) of the prepaid principal during year 3. The Salem Loan Facility contained customary affirmative and negative covenants that imposed restrictions on the Company s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes and changes in the nature of the Company s business, the purchase or redemption of any Company stock, and the declaration or payment of any dividends on the Company's stock. On June 30, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its agreement with Salem that delayed the application of one of the financial covenants. 
 
 On August 14, 2023, Salem made an additional advance of million to the Company. The interest rate for the advance was per annum, with principal and interest due in August 2027. In conjunction with this advance, the Company incurred cash closing costs of thousand, including a closing fee of thousand, and issued shares of common stock to Salem. The million advance was allocated between notes payable, common stock and additional paid-in capital based on the relative fair value of the underlying common stock and an approximate effective interest rate of .

The additional advances have an interest rate of per annum, with payment of interest deferred until the April 30, 2024 maturity date. The Company determined that the A R Loan Agreement represented a debt modification and, accordingly, no extinguishment accounting was required. As a result of prospectively revising the amortization of existing debt discount of previous advances, new approximate effective interest rates between and were established on the previous advances. The A R Agreement provides that the Company must maintain compliance with certain net cash flow and liquidity requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in full compliance with all covenants, representations, and warranties set forth in the A R Loan Agreement.

AMB Investments, LLC owns a participation interest in those advances, giving it a pecuniary interest in approximately million of the Salem Loan Facility and shares of common stock issued to Salem in connection with the advances made in the second half of 2023. Director, Gary Smith is President of AMB Investments, LLC. 
 
 On March 28, 2024, Salem extended the maturity date of the Salem Loan Facility from April 30, 2024 to January 31, 2026.

In addition the Company paid Salem an aggregate fee of in connection with the revisions and of outstanding paid-in-kind interest was exchanged for shares of common stock and five -year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with the closing of a private placement offering in late March and early April, 2024 (' the 2024 Private Placement') referenced in Note 6. The Company determined that the maturity extension and revisions should be accounted for as troubled debt restructuring pursuant to ASC 470. As a result of the troubled debt restructuring, (i) a new effective interest rate of was established, and (ii) the aggregate of of fees paid to the lender was recorded as debt discount to be amortized over the remaining term of the debt, and (iii) additional debt discount in the amount of was recorded and to be amortized over the remaining term of the debt, which represents the difference between of paid-in-kind interest exchanged for common stock and warrants with an aggregate fair value of in connection with the 2024 Private Placement. 
 
 On August 2, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the "Salem Amendment") with Salem. Pursuant to the Salem Amendment, which became effective on August 5, 2024, the Company paid down the principal balance on the Salem Loan Facility from million to million. Additionally, the maturity date was extended from January 31, 2026 to December 31, 2028 and the interest rate was reduced from (comprising payment-in-kind (deferred) and cash) to cash. The Company determined that the Salem Amendment should be accounted for as a debt extinguishment which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the amount financed under the Salem Loan Facility approximates its fair value as the interest rate is equal to the Company's market rate for equivalent financing terms. 

As of September 30, 2024, the total amount the Company has financed under the Salem Loan Facility is:

Convertible Notes Payable 
 
 In July 2023, the Company entered into note purchase agreements with certain accredited investors pursuant to which the Company issued unsecured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of (the "Convertible Notes"), which mature on December 31, 2024 the Maturity Date ). Of such aggregate principal amount, the Company issued Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of to the Company s Chief Executive Officer (in the principal amount of and his family members (in the aggregate principal amount of ). Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of accrue interest at a simple rate of per annum, payable at maturity, and one Convertible Note in the principal amount of accrues interest at a simple rate of per annum, payable at maturity. Upon the issuance of equity securities pursuant to which the Company receives aggregate gross proceeds of at least million (the Next Equity Financing ), the Convertible Notes will automatically convert into the same equity securities issued in such Next Equity Financing at a conversion price equal to the lowest per share purchase price of equity securities issued in the Next Equity Financing. Further, in the event of a change of control of the Company, each convertible note will, at the election of the holder, either be: (a) repaid in cash at an amount equal to the sum of (i) the outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest due on such Convertible Note plus (ii) an additional amount equal to of such outstanding amount due; or (b) converted into shares of the Company s common stock equal to the outstanding balance of the Convertible Note (including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon) divided by per share. At any time on or after the Maturity Date but prior to the date the Convertible Note is repaid by the Company, at the election of the holder thereof, such holder s Convertible Note will convert into that number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole share) obtained by dividing x the outstanding principal balance and unpaid accrued interest of such Convertible Note on the date of such conversion by (y) per share. 

The Company analyzed the embedded features of the Convertible Notes and determined that the Convertible Notes contained (i) an automatic conversion pursuant to which the holders may elect to convert their Convertible Notes into shares of the Company s common stock at a price of per share which did not require bifurcation, (ii) a redemption feature pursuant to an event of a Next Equity Financing which did not require bifurcation, (iii) a put option triggered upon a change of control with a fair value of which was bifurcated from the debt host and recorded with a credit to derivative liabilities and a debit to debt discount, and (iv) an automatic conversion pursuant to which the Convertible Notes may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock at a price of per share upon a change of control which did not require bifurcation. Including the impact of the embedded features, Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of have an approximate effective simple interest rate of per annum, and one Convertible Notes in the principal of has an approximate effective simple interest rate of per annum. The debt discount was being amortized over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and the derivative liabilities are marked-to-market at each reporting date. See Note 8 Derivative Liabilities for additional details. 
 
 On March 28, 2024, all of the Convertible Notes, including accrued interest, were converted into equity in connection with the 2024 Private Placement referenced in Note 6.

The Company was responsible for paying interest-only payments to the financing company related to the furniture procurement order (interest on principal of thousand) placed in April 2022 prior to the first scheduled principal financing payment, which occurred in August 2022 thousand). The Company made interest-only payments to the financing company related to the furniture procurement order through August 2022 in the amount of thousand. The total scheduled principal and interest payments to be made after September 30, 2024 related to the April 2022 furniture financing are thousand.

 Upon the closing of the Merger and the private placement offering in 2021 (the 2021 APO ), there were shares of common stock issued and outstanding: (i) shares of common stock issued in the Merger in exchange for the capital stock and convertible debt of Guerrilla RF Operating Corporation, (ii) shares of common stock held by pre-merger stockholders of Laffin Acquisition Corp., our predecessor, (iii) an aggregate of shares of common stock issued in the 2021 APO, and (iv) an aggregate of 45,834 shares of common stock issued to the placement agent and its affiliates in connection with the 2021 APO. The aggregate gross proceeds from the 2021 APO was million before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of approximately million. 
 
 On December 30, 2022, the Company completed the initial closing of a private placement (the 2022/23 PIPE as it entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the Unit Purchase Agreement with investors (the Purchasers pursuant to which the Company sold units (the Units ), each Unit consisting of share of the Company s common stock and warrant to purchase one -half of a share of common stock. The purchase price of each Unit was per Unit, resulting in gross proceeds at this initial closing of approximately million before the deduction of estimated offering expenses of approximately .

 See Note 5 Debt Salem Loan Facility and Convertible Notes Payable for details regarding common stock issued in connection with debt. 

Common Stock Warrants 
 
 As mentioned above, on February 28, 2023, the Company completed the 2022/23 PIPE. Each Unit sold in the 2022/23 PIPE included one warrant to purchase one -half of a share of common stock. Thus, Units sold in the 2022/23 PIPE included warrants to purchase shares, which warrants were issued upon the final closing of the 2022/23 PIPE. The warrant shares comprise purchaser warrant shares and placement agent warrant shares, each exercisable for a period of five years beginning six months following the final closing of the 2022/23 PIPE. The 2024 Units sold in the 2024 Private Placement included warrants to purchase a total of shares of common stock, which warrants were issued upon the final closing of the 2024 Private Placement. Each warrant is exercisable for a period of five years beginning six months following the final closing of the 2024 Private Placement. On August 5, 2024, the Company completed a private placement (the North Run Private Placement ), which included the issuance of warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share. Each warrant is exercisable for a period of five and a half years beginning on the closing date of the North Run Private Placement and were determined to be classified as liabilities on the issuance date and as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of outstanding common stock warrants is . See Note 8 Fair Value Measurement Warrant Liabilities for additional details regarding the Company s outstanding warrants. 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 
 The Company s Board of Directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each series. There was and issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company completed the North Run Private Placement, selling (i) an aggregate of shares of Series A convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares ), which are initially convertible into shares (the Conversion Shares of the Company s common stock, and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share (the 'North Run Warrants') for an aggregate gross purchase price of million. The securities were sold to NR-PRL Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of North Run Capital, LP (the Buyer pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into by the Company and the Buyer on August 2, 2024 the Purchase Agreement ). The net proceeds from the North Run Private Placement was approximately million after transaction expenses. 
 
 For so long as the Buyer of the Preferred Shares beneficially owns at least of the Conversion Shares underlying the Preferred Shares issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the Buyer Ownership Condition ), the Company may not, without the consent of Buyer, create, authorize, or issue shares of capital stock that are senior or pari passu to the Preferred Shares; incur aggregate indebtedness for borrowed money (subject to certain exceptions) in excess of million; change its line of business; or amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the special rights, powers and preferences of the Preferred Shares. In addition, the Purchase Agreement provides that, for so long as the Buyer Ownership Condition is satisfied, the Company may not, without the consent of Buyer, issue more than of its outstanding shares of common stock as of August 2, 2024 subject to exceptions for stock plans and acquisitions) or within 120 days of the closing of the offering issue any equity securities (subject to exceptions for stock plans and acquisitions). 
 
 The Purchase Agreement required that the Board of Directors of the Company increase the size of the Board from eight to ten directors and appoint each of Thomas B. Ellis and Todd B. Hammer (the Board Designees to the Board effective immediately following the closing of the offering. The Purchase Agreement further provides that, at any stockholders meeting at which directors are to be elected and for so long as the Buyer satisfies the Buyer Ownership Condition, the Board will nominate and recommend the reelection of any Board Designees whose terms of office expire at such stockholder meeting. 
 
 Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed that for so long as the Buyer Ownership Condition is satisfied, the Buyer will have a right to participate on a pro rata basis in equity financings or issuances of securities convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable into equity securities of the Company or any subsidiaries (including debt securities with an equity component), subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 The Series A convertible preferred stock is subject to automatic redemption for cash upon a Fundamental Transaction by the Company, which includes a merger, sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company, recapitalization, or the sale of more than of the voting stock of the Company which results in the Series A convertible preferred stock being classified as temporary equity. In such event, the redemption price would be equal to the greater of the stated value of the Series A convertible preferred stock or the consideration per share of common stock in the Fundamental Transaction (or in the absence of such consideration, the volume-weighted average price of the Company s common stock immediately preceding the closing of the Fundamental Transaction). Additionally, after analyzing the cashless exercise provision within the North Run Warrants, the Company has determined that the North Run Warrants are classified as liabilities to be carried at fair value (See Note 8 Fair Value Measurement Warrant Liabilities for additional details). As a result, the Company allocated the gross proceeds and offering costs to the Preferred Shares and the North Run Warrants on a fair value basis. As a result, the Company recorded approximately million of gross proceeds, which was partially offset by thousand of offering costs, with a credit to temporary equity to account for the Preferred Shares. Additionally, the Company initially recorded a warrant liability of approximately million to account for the North Run Warrants, and expensed approximately thousand of offering costs which were allocated to the North Run Warrants. The Company has not made any adjustments to the carrying value of the Series A convertible preferred stock to reflect the redemption value of the shares upon a change of control because the Company has determined that a change of control event is not probable of occurring. 

shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan. Subsequently, stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares available under the 2014 Plan to shares. Exercise prices range from to per share, depending on the date of the award. No further awards may be made under the 2014 Plan. 
 
 In 2021, the Board adopted the Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan ), which authorizes the award of stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance awards, cash awards, and stock bonus awards. The Company initially reserved shares of common stock, plus any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2014 Plan on the effective date of the 2021 Plan, for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan will increase automatically on January 1 each year until 2031 by the number of shares equal to the lesser of of the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31, or a number as may be determined by our Board. 
 
 The general purpose of the 2014 Plan and the 2021 Plan is to allow the Company to attract and motivate key employees and directors to align their interests with those of the Company s shareholders. 
 
 Stock Option Awards 
 
 The Company measures the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account inputs such as the exercise price, the value of the underlying ordinary shares at the grant date, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The fair value of each grant of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was determined using the methods and assumptions discussed below: 

The expected term of employee options is determined using the simplified method, as prescribed in the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to the Company s lack of sufficient historical data. 

The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the publicly traded common stock of a peer group of companies. 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected term. 

The expected dividend yield is because the Company has not historically paid and does not expect to pay a dividend on its common stock for the foreseeable future.

Legal 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become involved in legal disputes. In the opinion of management, any potential liabilities resulting from any disputes would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. As a re sult, liability r elated to any such disputes has been recorded at September 30, 2024 , or December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 
 From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may indemnify other parties when it enters into contractual relationships, including members of the Board of Directors, employees, customers, lessors, lenders, and parties to other transactions with the Company. In addition, the Company may agree to hold other parties harmless against specific losses, such as those that could arise from a breach of representation, covenant, or third -party infringement claims. It may not be possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under such indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Management believes any liability arising from these agreements will not be material to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result, liability f or these agreements has been recorded at September 30, 2024 , or December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Employment Agreement 
 
 The Company has entered into an employment agreement with one executive. This employment agreement was entered into effective as of January 1, 2020 and automatically renews annually. The Company desired the assurance of the executive's continued association and services to retain the executive's experience, skills, abilities, background, and knowledge. The employment is at-will, and the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. The terms of the agreement stipulate compensation, benefits, specific restrictive covenants, and Company obligations upon termination of the employment agreement, including severance pay calculated as twelve monthly payments of the executive's monthly base salary. 
 
 Salary Deferral Program 
 
 In 2023, the Company introduced a voluntary salary deferral program in order to facilitate increased employee ownership in the Company, whereby all employees were offered the opportunity to defer a portion of their salaries, in anticipation of some or all of the deferred payments being invested in a future capital raise. Beginning June 28, 2023, Ryan Pratt, Mark Mason, John Berg, and Kellie Chong elected to defer approximately , , , and , respectively, of their salaries as participants in the program along with a number of other employees. The Company subsequently terminated this program and effective September 4, 2023, the Company s entire executive management team, including Ryan Pratt, CEO and Chairman of the Company, John Berg, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason, the Company s Chief Operating Officer, and Kellie Chong, the Company s Chief Business Officer, voluntarily reduced their salaries by as part of a plan by the Company to reduce expenses. Following the closing of the 2024 Private Placement, the Board of Directors reinstated the salaries of the management team, effective January 1, 2024. The voluntary salary deferred payments were repaid to employees in March 2024 in accordance with the term of the deferral program. 

to pre-tax income primarily due to a valuation allowance. 
 
 The computation of the annual estimated effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and significant judgment including, but not limited to, the expected operating income for the year and permanent differences. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is obtained, additional information becomes known, or the tax environment changes. 
 
 In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management must determine that there will be sufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets. Based upon the historical and anticipated future losses, management has determined that the deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold for realizability. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the Company s net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which differences are expected to reverse. 
 
 Potential 382 Limitation 
 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company had federal NOL and R D credit carryforwards of approximately and , respectively, which are generally available to offset future taxable income subject to any future "ownership change." 
 
 The Company s ability to utilize its net operating loss ("NOL") and research and development ("R D") credit carryforwards may be substantially limited due to ownership changes that could occur in the future, as provided under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , as amended (the "Code"), as well as similar State provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three -year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percent of a company's outstanding stock by certain stockholders or public groups. 
 
 If the Company experiences an ownership change, utilization of the NOL or R D credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation, which is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term, tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. The Section 382 limitation is a limitation on the amount of a new loss corporation s post-change year taxable income that can be offset by the old loss corporation s pre-change NOLs. Any such limitation may result in the expiration of a portion of the Company's NOL or R D credit carryforwards before utilization. Any carryforwards that expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance. 
 
 In 2022 , the Company's tax advisors completed a study to assess whether one or more ownership changes had occurred since the Company became a loss corporation under the definition of Section 382 . At that time, it was determined that the Company had not experienced any "ownership changes" since 2014 . As a result of the North Run Private Placement the Company is completing an updated study to determine if an ownership change has occurred. Any carryforward limitations may result in the expiration of a portion of the NOL or R D credit carryforwards before utilization. Until the Section 382 study is completed, no amounts are being considered as an uncertain tax position or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit under ASC- 740. Any carryforwards that expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance. Due to the existence of the Company's full deferred tax valuation allowance, it is not expected that any potential limitation will have an impact on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.

THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 34.4 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher demand for our wireless infrastructure products (up 277 compared to the prior year period). Other products also contributed to growth, including our catalogue products and our wireless audio products (up 90 and 300 , respectively from the year ago period). In the third quarter of 2024, the Company also experienced significant growth in international sales (up 183 compared to the prior year period). US sales also grew, but at a slower pace (up 14.3 compared to the prior year period). In the third quarter of 2024, new customer sales contributed significantly to the increased demand for our products, with new customer sales up 193 from the third quarter of 2023. Existing customer sales were essentially flat when compared to the third quarter of 2023 up less than 1 over the same period. 
 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 65.3 of revenues as compared to 55.7 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company's contribution margin of 77.2 increased from 71.3 in the year ago quarter, as a result of changes in product mix and a shift to higher margin wireless infrastructure products. Over these same periods, overhead spending remained at 0.5 million, and as a percentage of sales it decreased significantly from 15.7 in the third quarter of 2023 to 11.9 in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Operating loss was 2.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 3.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease in operating loss was primarily due to higher revenues and gross profits which grew at a significant pace while total operating expenses stayed consistent at 5.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Relative to total revenue, operating expenses decreased as a percentage (123 in the third quarter of 2024 vs. 166 in the third quarter of 2023). R D costs decreased 10 when compared to the prior year period. Sales and marketing increased 21 , while administrative costs were reduced by 5 . 
 
 Loss on debt extinguishment was 1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. This loss was a result of the Salem Amendment on August 5, 2024, and is non-recurring. 
 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities was 2.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. Due to the increase in the stock price of the Company's common stock between August 5, 2024 and September 30,2024 there was a remeasurement of the Historical Warrants and the North Run Warrants. 
 
 Net loss per share was 0.71 and 0.62 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Key Metrics (Non-GAAP Measures) 
 
 These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Company results as reported under GAAP. The Company compensates for such limitations by relying primarily on GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only as supplemental data. In addition, because these non-GAAP measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these measures, as defined by us, may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 
 We regularly review the followin g key metrics to mea sure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess working capital needs.

Number of products released: The total number of distinct new products released into production (products that have completed design, quality, and supply chain readiness) during the period. 
 
 Number of total products: The cumulative number of production-released products since our inception through the end of the period. 
 
 Number of products with lifetime revenue exceeding 100 thousand: The number of products that have achieved the threshold of cumulative sales of 100,000 since our inception through the end of the period. 
 
 Product backlog : The amount of product sales that have been committed to by customers, but have not yet been completed, shipped, or invoiced. The Company's product backlog can be materially impacted by supply chain constraints, a shift in customer ordering patterns whereby customers place orders in anticipation of extended product delivery lead times, or other customer order delivery request modifications. Furthermore, because the Company partners closely with a number of its customers to produce high-performance, quality components that are often designed into customers end products, immediate substitution of the Company s products is neither typically desired by customers nor necessarily feasible. As such, the Company has not historically experienced significant order cancellations, and the Company does not expect significant order cancellations in the future. The Company closely monitors product backlog and its potential impact on the Company s financial performance. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We derive our revenue from sales of high-performance RF semiconductor products. We design, integrate, and package differentiated, semiconductor-based products that we sell to customers through our direct sales organization, a network of independent sales representatives, and distributors. We generate revenue from customers located within and outside the U.S. In addition to sales to customers, we generate royalty revenue under a royalty agreement with one semiconductor manufacturer. 
 
 Direct Product Costs and Gross Profit 
 
 Direct Product Costs. Our direct product costs consist of actual direct product expenses, salaries and related expenses, overhead, third-party services vendors, and depreciation expense related to the equipment and information technology costs incurred directly in the Company s revenue-generating activities. 
 
 Gross Profit. Our gross profit is calculated by subtracting our cost of revenues from revenues. Gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total revenues. Our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period as revenues fluctuate due to the mix of products we sell to customers, royalty revenue volume, operational efficiencies, and changes to our technology expenses and customer support. 

29

Table of Contents 

We plan to focus on and grow the sales volume of new and existing products with the highest gross margin. We intend to continue investing additional resources in our engineering and design capabilities, which drive our research and development efforts and, in turn, drive additional revenue streams and enable us to improve our gross margin over time. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenues in the future. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses consist primarily of research and development expenses (R D), sales and marketing expenses, and employee compensation costs for operations management, finance, accounting, information technology, compliance, and human resources personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include non-personnel costs, such as facilities, legal, accounting, and other professional fees, and other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, but we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percent of revenues in the coming years. 
 
 R D expenses consist of costs for the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our products and are generally expensed as incurred. These costs consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and share-based compensation for our product development personnel. Research and development expenses also include training costs, product management, third-party partner fees, and third-party consulting fees. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, but as a percent of revenues, R D expenses are expected to decrease. 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs related to sales and marketing, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and share-based compensation, costs of general marketing activities and promotional activities, travel-related expenses, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include costs for advertising and other marketing activities. Advertising is expensed as incurred. As we expand our sales and marketing efforts, we expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars. 
 
 Non-income taxes include excise taxes, sales and use taxes, capital stock and franchise taxes, and property taxes. Capital stock and franchise taxes are taxes that states charge the Company for the privilege of incorporating or doing business in a state. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on our debt obligations, our factoring arrangement expense, the non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of common shares issued to certain of our debtholders, and lease expense related to our capital leases.

Revenues increased 1.2 million to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The i ncrease in revenues was attributable to a 0.9 million increase in wireless infrastructure product shipments as product ramp for new customers drove volume up. Revenues were also impacted by increased demand from our international customers, which increased to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 0.4 million in the prior year period. Automotive sales declined from 1.7 million in the year ago period to 1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. All other products increased 0.9 million over the prior year period which include our Catalogue products that are used in numerous applications by our customers.

Table of Contents 

We generate revenue from customers located within and outside the U.S. While we have several large customers, we define major customers as those responsible for more than 10 of Guerrilla R F s annual product shipment revenue. Using this definition, Guerrilla RF had one major customer, RFPD, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. RFPD, a large product distributor serving numerous end-user customers, generated 73 and 79 of product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Our existin g product sales increased from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of increased sales from new and existing design wins that ramped in 2024. We also continue to grow our business through the acquisition of new customers. Sales to new customers grew 193 to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 International shipments grew substantially at 183 fro m 0.4 million to 1.1 milli on (approximately 25 of the third quarter of 2024 sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Direct product costs increased 0.1 million to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 5 increase in direct product cost was driven by a sales volume increase of 62 . Increases in direct product costs were less than increases in revenues as changes in product mix resulted in lower costs relative to revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 55.7 for the third quarter of 2023, to 65.3 for the third quarter of 2024 driven in part by higher contribution margins from product mix shifts but as importantly from leverage off of fixed overhead costs which improved margins 380 basis points. Product mix contributed heavily to the improvement in overall gross margins. Products that have costs relative to sales of less than 20 (or 80 + contribution margins) grew 69 from the year ago period, while products with costs relative to sales of greater than 35 (or 65 or lower contribution margins) declined 39 . Overall contribution margins improved 590 basis points from the year ago period. 
 
 In addition to the impact of improved contribution margins due to product mix on gross profit and gross margin, improved leverage off of fixed overhead costs improved gross margin percentages by 380 basis points as revenues increased from the year ago period of 34 while the absolute change in dollars spend on fixed overhead were flat at 0.5 million. As a result, the gross margin loss decreased from 157 basis points to 119 basis points. 
 
 Overall direct product costs due to sales volume increase 34 or 0.5 million, had no change in fixed costs and decreased relative to the prior year period due to improved product mix by 29 or 0.4 million), for a net increase of 5 .

Interest expense decreased 0.3 million to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was attributable to a significant paydown of two debt facilities. On August 5, 2024 the Company paid down the Salem Loan Facility by 7.5 million, leaving a remaining balance of 4.5 million. In addition, the Company utilized less of its asset-based loan, during the third quarter 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the amount drawn under the Spectrum Loan Facility was 0.5 million compared to 1.0 million on September 30, 2023. 
 
 The loss on debt extinguishment increased by 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was the result of the Salem Amendment mentioned in Note 5. 
 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities increased by 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Due to the increase in the stock price of the Company's common stock between August 5, 2024 and September 30,2024 there was a remeasurement of the Historical Warrants and the North Run Warrants, which are accounted for as liabilities and carried at fair value at September 30, 2024.

Revenues increased 5.3 million to 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in revenues was attributable to a 4.0 million increase in wireless infrastructure product shipments as programs at new customers drove volume up. Revenues were also impacted by increased demand from to our international customers, which more than doubled to 3.0 million. Our catalogue products also enjoyed healthy increases growing by 62 to 2.1 million. Repeaters/DAS revenue increased 0.7 million to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by declines in automotive products which decreased 0.8 million, or 16.1 , to 4.3 million.

 Nonproduct (royalty and non-recurring engineering ("NRE")) revenues were down 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to September 30, 2023 , at essentially 0. 
 
 International shipments grew substantially, increasing 109 from 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (approximately 19 of the total third quarter 2024 product sales).

Direct product costs increased 1.1 million to 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The 25 increase in direct product costs was driven by a sales volume increase of 52 . Increases in direct product costs were less than increases in revenues as changes in product mix resulted in lower costs relative to revenue. 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 57.2 for the nine months ended September 2023, to 64.6 for the nine months ended September 2024, driven by higher contribution margins from product mix shifts, as well as improved leverage off of fixed overhead costs. Product mix contributed heavily to the improvement in overall gross margins. Products that have costs relative to sales of less than 20 (or 80 + contribution margins) grew 196 from the year ago period, while products with costs relative to sales of greater than 35 (or 65 or lower contribution margins) declined 16 . Overall contribution margins improved 290 basis points from the year ago period. 
 
 In addition to the impact of improved contribution margins due to product mix on gross profit and gross margin, improved leverage off of fixed overhead costs improved gross margin percentages by 450 basis points as revenues increased from the year ago period of 25 while the absolute change in dollars spend on fixed overhead were nearly flat at 1.7 million or 0.1 million higher than the prior year period of 1.6 million. As a result, the gross margin loss decreased from 150 basis points to 110 basis points. 
 
 Overall direct product costs that were due to sales volume increases of 52 or 2.2 million were offset by lower direct product costs due to mix for net increase of 25 , 1.1 million while there was no change in fixed costs.

Interest expense increased 1.5 million to 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was attributable to reductions in the Company's two principal loan facilities. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company paid down 7.5 million of the 12 million balance of the Salem Loan Facility, greatly reducing interest expense, beginning in August 2024. In addition, the Company utilized less of its asset-based loan. As of September 30, 2024, the amount drawn under the Spectrum Loan Facility was 0.5 million compared to 1.0 million on September 30, 2023. 
 
 The loss on debt extinguishment increased by 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was the result of the Salem Amendment mentioned in Note 5. 
 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities increased by 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was the result of the remeasurement of the Historical Warrants and the North Run Warrants that are accounted for as liabilities and carried at fair value at September 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary source of liquidity has been cash raised from private placements and debt financing. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash resources of 11.3 million. We also have two loan facilities, one of which is for up to 3.75 million with a specialty lender (referred to as the Spectrum Loan Facility, described in Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements), and the other of which is for up to 4.5 million with a different lender (referred to as the Salem Loan Facility, also described in Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). As of September 30, 2024, we had drawn down 0.5 million under the Spectrum Loan Facility and 4.5 million under the Salem Loan Facility. On March 28, 2024 we completed the initial closing of the 2024 Private Placement of approximately 5 million, raising net cash proceeds of approximately 3 million, after deduction of expenses and the conversion of existing debt. On April 7, 2024, we completed a second closing, raising additional net cash proceeds of approximately 0.1 million after deduction of expenses. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company completed the North Run Private Placement, raising cash proceeds of approximately 21.6 million, net of transaction expenses. Additionally, on August 2, 2024, the Company initiated the amendment of the Salem Loan Facility to (i) reduce the outstanding principal balance from 12.0 million to 4.5 million, (ii) extend the maturity date from January 31, 2026 to December 31, 2028, and (iii) reduce the interest rate from 14 (comprising 3 payment-in-kind (deferred) and 11 cash) to 12 cash. The amendment was effective on August 5, 2024 after the principal balance was reduced from 12.0 million to 4.5 million by using a portion of the proceeds from the North Run transaction. 
 
 The Company believes that its existing cash following the North Run Private Placement will provide sufficient resources to support operations and cover existing contractual obligations and other obligations that may arise through the next twelve months and beyond. 
 
 We have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and have an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024 of 55.4 million. We expect losses and negative cash flows to continue in the near term, primarily due to continued investment in research and development, sales and marketing efforts, and increased administration expenses as our Company grows. We plan to continue to invest in the implementation of our long-term strategic plan and we anticipate that we will continue to narrow cash burn from historical levels so that over time cash reserves will provide the necessary working capital to operate the Company.

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash used in operating activities was 3.8 million and 11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to our net loss of 12.3 million, including non-cash items of 8.0 million, and an increase in working capital of 0.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-cash items that were a part of the net operating loss included depreciation and amortization of 1.1 million, stock-based compensation of 1.2 million, change in fair value of warrant liabilities and derivative liabilities of 2.5 million, loss on the extinguishment of debt of 1.5 million and non-cash and accretion of notes payable of 1.7 million. 
 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was principally due to our net loss of 12.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, non-cash items that were a part of the net operating loss included depreciation of 1.2 million and stock-based compensation of 0.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, decreases in accounts payable of 1.8 million and increases to accounts receivable of 0.4 million partially contributed to the cash used in operating cash flow as noted above. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 674 thousand and 138 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash used in investing activities resulted from the purchase of intangible assets in the second quarter of 2024 and from capital expenditures on property and equipment for all periods presented. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 15.0 million was primarily attributable to net proceeds of 24.6 million from private placement equity financings in the second and third quarter of 2024 along with significant debt repayments made in the third quarter of 2024 of 8.4 million. A total of 1.2 million, related to principal payments on finance leases and repayment of financed insurance premiums, also contributed to the net cash provided. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 7.9 million was primarily attributable to net private placement offering proceeds of 5.4 million and 3.8 million of additional debt financing including the existing asset based line. Additional contributors to the net cash provided by financing activities were principal payments on finance leases of 0.8 million and repayments of finance insurance premiums of 0.4 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements involve revenue recognition, the valuation of our stock-based compensation, including the underlying estimated fair value of our common stock, derivative liabilities, warrant liabilities, lease accounting, and income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets . Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future consolidated financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. 
 
 Other than as described under Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements and as described above, the Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024, have not materially changed. 
 
 We believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we think are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 
 We recognize the grant-date fair value of share-based awards issued as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. To date, we have not issued awards where vesting is subject to performance or market conditions. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the time of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the use of inputs and assumptions such as the fair value of the underlying common stock, exercise price of the option, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and dividend yield, the most critical of which is the estimated fair value of our common stock. 
 
 The estimated fair value of each grant of stock options awarded during fiscal 2024 and 2023 was determined using the following methods and assumptions: 

Fair value of common stock . M arket trading value. 

Expected term. Due to the lack of a large public market for the trading of our common stock and the lack of sufficient company-specific historical data, the expected term of employee stock options is determined using the simplified method, as prescribed in SAB No.107 ("SAB 107"), Share-Based Payment, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. 

37

Table of Contents 

Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected term. 

Expected volatility. The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of peer companies within our industry which were commensurate with the expected term assumption, as described in SAB 107. 

Dividend yield. We assume a dividend yield of 0 because we have never paid, and for the foreseeable future do not expect to pay, a dividend on our common stock. 

The inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different inputs and assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards. 
 
 The Option Price Method, or OPM, treats common stock as call options on a company s enterprise value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences of the preferred stock. The OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the price of the call option. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is so difficult to predict that forecasts would be highly speculative. 
 
 Our common stock became quoted on the OTCQX, an OTC Markets Group trading platform, on May 13, 2022. We began using our quoted common stock price as a fair value estimation factor to value our common stock once it achieved sufficient trading volume during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we are no longer an emerging growth company, or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. We have not elected to early adopt certain new accounting standards, as described in Note 2 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result, our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as set forth in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 None.
