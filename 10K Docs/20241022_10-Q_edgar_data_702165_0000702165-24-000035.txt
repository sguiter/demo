 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and subsidiaries (collectively, NS, we, us, and our) financial position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our results of operations, comprehensive income and changes in stockholders equity for the third quarters and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, and our cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). 
 
 These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

 Chemicals Metals and construction Automotive Merchandise Intermodal Coal Total 
 
 We recognize the amount of revenues to which we expect to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. A performance obligation is created when a customer under a transportation contract or public tariff submits a bill of lading to us for the transport of goods. These performance obligations are satisfied as the shipments move from origin to destination. As such, transportation revenues are recognized proportionally as a shipment moves, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. These performance obligations are generally short-term in nature with transit days averaging approximately one week or less for each commodity group. The customer has an unconditional obligation to pay for the service once the service has been completed. Estimated revenues associated with in-process shipments at period-end are recorded based on the estimated percentage of service completed. We had no material remaining performance obligations at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 We may provide customers ancillary services, such as switching, demurrage and other incidental activities, under their transportation contracts. The revenues associated with these distinct performance obligations are recognized when the services are performed or as contractual obligations are met. These revenues are included within each of the commodity groups and represent approximately of total Railway operating revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023.

 Performance Share Units 
 
 PSUs provide for awards based on the achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals at the end of a cycle and are settled through the issuance of shares of Common Stock. All PSUs will earn out based on the achievement of performance conditions and some will also earn out based on a market condition. The market condition fair value was measured on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. PSUs were earned or paid out during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023.

 In the first quarter of 2024, we commenced voluntary and involuntary separation programs to reduce our management workforce. Through these programs, approximately management employees were separated from service by May 2024. Restructuring and other charges reflects separation payments and other benefits to the impacted management employees and amounted to million for the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of these separation programs on our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, as further discussed in Note 12.

 During the third quarters and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, dividend equivalent payments were made to certain holders of stock options and RSUs. For purposes of computing basic earnings per share, dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and RSUs were deducted from net income to determine income available to common stockholders. For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, we evaluate on a grant-by-grant basis those stock options and RSUs receiving dividend equivalent payments under the two-class and treasury stock methods to determine which method is more dilutive for each grant. For those grants for which the two-class method was more dilutive, net income was reduced by dividend equivalent payments to determine income available to common stockholders. The dilution calculations exclude options having exercise prices exceeding the average market price of Common Stock as follows: million in the third quarters and first nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 mile railway line that extends from Cincinnati, Ohio to Chattanooga, Tennessee from the Cincinnati Southern Railway (CSR) for billion (of which billion was paid in 2023). We previously operated this line subject to an operating lease agreement, which was terminated upon the close of the transaction. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired in the transaction.

The term of our accounts receivable securitization program expires in May 2025. Amounts received under this facility are accounted for as borrowings. We had amounts outstanding under this program and our available borrowing capacity was million at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Our accounts receivable securitization program was supported by million and million in receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included in Accounts receivable net .

 During the first quarter of 2024, we commenced voluntary and involuntary separation programs to reduce our management workforce. Through these programs, approximately management employees were separated from service by May 2024. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits , we evaluated whether a curtailment of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans had occurred. While the reduction in our workforce did t result in

 railcars, of which were non-Company-owned tank cars containing hazardous materials. Fires associated with the derailment threatened certain tank cars. There was concern that the pressure inside of the tank cars carrying vinyl chloride was rising and that the pressure relief devices were no longer functioning properly, which would have posed the risk of a catastrophic explosion. As a consequence, on February 6, 2023, the local incident commander (the East Palestine Fire Chief) in consultation with the incident command that included, among others, federal, state and local officials and Norfolk Southern opted to conduct a controlled vent and burn of derailed tank cars, all of which contained vinyl chloride. This procedure involved creating holes in the tank cars to drain the vinyl chloride into adjacent trenches that had been dug into the ground where the vinyl chloride was ignited and burned. Any remaining materials released from the derailment or during the vent and burn have been or are being remediated. The February 3rd derailment, the associated fire, and the resulting vent and burn of the tank cars containing vinyl chloride on February 6th is hereinafter referred to as the Incident. 
 
 In response to the Incident, we have been working to clean the site safely and thoroughly, including those activities described in the Environmental Matters section below with respect to potentially impacted air, soil and water and to monitor for any impact on public health and the environment. We are working with federal, state, and local officials to mitigate impacts from the Incident, including, among other efforts, conducting environmental monitoring and clean-up activities (as more fully described below), operating a family assistance center to provide financial support to affected members of the East Palestine and surrounding communities, and committing additional financial support to the community .

million and million, respectively, which are discussed in further detail below. These amounts represent the difference between the recognized expense and cash expenditures (net of insurance recoveries) related to the Incident as of each respective date. From the inception of the Incident, we have recognized a total of billion in net expenses directly attributable to the Incident, which included million of insurance recoveries from claims made under our insurance policies. We have also recorded a deferred tax asset of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to the Incident expecting that certain expenses will be deductible for tax purposes in future periods or offset with insurance recoveries. 
 
 Certain costs incurred thus far and related to the Incident may be recoverable under our insurance policies in effect at the date of the Incident or from third parties. Any additional amounts recoverable under our insurance policies or from third parties will be reflected in future periods in which recovery is considered probable. For additional information about our insurance coverage, see Insurance below. 
 
 Environmental Matters In response to the Incident, we have been working with federal, state, and local officials such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Ohio EPA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and the Columbiana County Health District to conduct environmental response and remediation activities, some of which have concluded and some which are continuing, including but not limited to, excavating and disposing of potentially affected soil (based on sampling results), air monitoring, indoor air quality screenings, municipal water and private water well testing, residential, commercial, and agricultural soil sampling, surface water and groundwater sampling, re-routing a local waterway around the affected site, and capturing and shipping stormwater that enters the impacted derailment site to proper disposal facilities. The U.S. EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) on February 21, 2023, containing various requirements, including the submission of numerous work plans to assess and remediate various environmental media and performance of certain removal actions at the affected site. On February 24, 2023, we submitted to the U.S. EPA our Notice of Intent to Comply with the UAO. We continue to conduct environmental assessment and remediation activities pursuant to the UAO and the directives issued thereunder, including sampling and excavating soil (if needed based on sampling results) at the affected site, including areas beneath our tracks. On October 18, 2023, the U.S. EPA issued a second unilateral order under Section 311(c) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), requiring preparation of additional environmental work plans to address local waterways. We timely submitted our Notice of Intent to Comply with the CWA order and continue to complete environmental assessment and remediation as required by the U.S. EPA, as well as state agencies, in compliance with the CWA order. Once approved by the court, the proposed Consent Decree (discussed below) will supersede the UAO and CWA Order. 
 
 We are also subject to the following legal proceedings that principally relate to the environmental impact of the Incident: 
 
 The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil complaint on behalf of the U.S. EPA (the DOJ Complaint) in the Northern District of Ohio (Eastern Division) seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for alleged violations of the CWA and cost recovery under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The Ohio Attorney General (AG) also filed a lawsuit (the Ohio Complaint) in the Northern District of Ohio (Eastern Division) seeking damages for a variety of common law and environmental statutory claims under CERCLA and various state laws. The DOJ and Ohio AG cases have been consolidated for discovery purposes. We have filed an answer, and discovery is ongoing in the Ohio AG case. On 
 
 18 

million through November 30, 2023 as well as additional oversight costs from December 1, 2023 until the remediation is complete. The proposed Consent Decree also requires the Company to pay a civil penalty of million for alleged violations of the CWA. Other provisions of the proposed Consent Decree relate to injunctive relief for safety, community support, and environmental support, which provisions, if approved by the court, will be in effect between to . The proposed Consent Decree was subject to a mandatory public comment period, which ended on August 2, 2024, and DOJ filed a motion on October 10, 2024 seeking entry of the Consent Decree. The Ohio AG did not join this settlement and its claims remain outstanding and are proceeding. 
 
 In accordance with FASB ASC 410-30 Environmental Liabilities, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had recognized probable and reasonably estimable liabilities in connection with the foregoing environmental matters of million and million, respectively, and which are primarily included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognized million and million of expense during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. We made million and million in payments during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to these matters. Our current estimate includes ongoing and future environmental cleanup activities and remediation efforts, governmental oversight costs (including those incurred by the U.S. EPA and the Ohio EPA), and other related costs, including those in connection with the proposed DOJ Consent Decree (including civil penalties related to alleged violations of the CWA). Our current estimates of future environmental cleanup and remediation liabilities related to the Incident may change over time due to various factors, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of required future cleanup and removal activities (including those resulting from soil, water, and sediment remediation activities that are currently being, and will continue to be, conducted at the site), and the extent and duration of governmental oversight, amongst other factors. As clean-up efforts progress and more information is available, we will review these estimates and revise as appropriate. Since the date of the Incident, we have recognized a total of billion in expenses related to environmental matters, of which million has been paid. 
 
 Legal Proceedings and Claims (Non-Environmental) To date, numerous non-environmental legal actions have commenced with respect to the Incident, including those more specifically set forth below. 
 
 There is a consolidated putative class action pending in the Northern District of Ohio (Eastern Division) (the Ohio Class Action) in which plaintiffs allege various claims, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, and nuisance, and seeking as relief compensatory and punitive damages, medical monitoring and business losses. The putative class is defined by reference to a class area covering a -mile radius. On July 12, 2023, we filed a third-party complaint bringing in multiple parties involved in the Incident. Fact discovery ended on February 5, 2024. The Court denied in part and granted in part all motions to dismiss, as to the plaintiffs case and as to our third-party complaint, on March 13, 2024. On April 9, 2024, we announced that we reached an agreement in principle to settle the Ohio Class Action for million. The settlement agreement does not resolve, and expressly preserves, our third-party claims in the third-party complaint. The court granted final approval of the settlement on September 27, 2024, which was subsequently appealed to the Sixth Circuit. The settlement agreement will resolve all class action claims within a -mile radius from the derailment and, for those residents who choose to participate, personal injury claims within a -mile radius from the derailment. We made a partial payment of the 
 
 19 

million and the remaining balance could be paid as early as November 8, 2024; however, that payment, including timing, is dependent upon resolution of any appeals to the settlement. 
 
 Another putative class action is pending in the Western District of Pennsylvania, brought by Pennsylvania school districts and students. On August 22, 2023, Pennsylvania school districts and students filed a putative class action lawsuit alleging negligence, strict liability, nuisance, and trespass, and seeking damages and health monitoring. On December 8, 2023, the school districts amended their complaint to add additional companies as defendants in the action. On February 23, 2024, we and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss and those motions are fully briefed and currently pending before the court. Combined with the Ohio Class Action, these lawsuits are collectively referred to herein as the Incident Lawsuits. 
 
 In accordance with FASB ASC 450, Contingencies, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accruals for probable and reasonably estimable liabilities principally associated with the Incident Lawsuits and related contingencies of million and million, respectively. For the reasons set forth below, our estimated loss or range of loss with respect to the Incident Lawsuits may change from time to time, and it is reasonably possible that we will incur actual losses in excess of the amounts currently accrued and such additional amounts may be material. While we continue to work with parties with respect to potential resolution, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in doing so and we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
 
 We have received securities and derivative litigation and multiple shareholder document and litigation demand letters, including a securities class action lawsuit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) initially filed in the Southern District of Ohio alleging multiple securities law violations but since transferred to the Northern District of Georgia, a securities class action lawsuit under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) filed in the Southern District of New York alleging misstatements in association with our debt offerings, and shareholder derivative complaints filed in Virginia state court asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment in connection with safety of the Company s operations, among other claims (collectively, the Shareholder Matters). On February 2, 2024, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the Securities Act lawsuit, and on July 26, 2024, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation to the district judge, recommending that the defendants motion to dismiss be granted in part and denied in part. Defendants objections to the Report and Recommendation were filed on August 9, 2024, and plaintiffs response to defendants objections were filed on August 23, 2024. A decision on the motion to dismiss remains pending. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the Exchange Act lawsuit on April 25, 2024, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 24, 2024. A decision on the motion to dismiss remains pending. No responsive pleadings have been filed yet with respect to the other Shareholder Matters. 
 
 We are also named as a defendant in various other Incident-related litigation involving other potentially affected third parties. We do not currently believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 
 With respect to the Incident-related litigation and regulatory matters, we record a liability for loss contingencies through a charge to earnings when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated and disclose such liability if we conclude it to be material. Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known. Because the final outcome of any of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, developments related to the progress of such legal proceedings or other unfavorable or unexpected developments or outcomes could result in additional costs or new or additionally accrued amounts that could be material to our results of operations in a particular 
 
 20 

recommendations, of which were issued to Norfolk Southern. The NTSB continues to work on a safety culture investigation, and a report on this part of the investigation is expected to be issued by the spring of 2025. 
 
 Concurrent with the NTSB Investigation, the FRA also investigated the Incident. Similar in scope to the NTSB Investigation, the FRA examined railroad equipment, track conditions, hazardous materials train placement and routing, and emergency response (the FRA Incident Investigation). The FRA Incident Investigation will likely result in the assessment of civil penalties, though the amount and materiality of these penalties cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition to the FRA Incident Investigation, the FRA completed a 60-day supplemental safety assessment (the FRA Safety Assessment). The FRA Safety Assessment included a review of findings from a previously completed 2022 system audit and an assessment of operational elements including, but not limited to: track, signal, and rolling stock maintenance, inspection and repair practices; protection of employees;

22 

include liabilities for other environmental exposures of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, of which million is classified as a current liability at the end of both periods. At September 30, 2024, the liability represents our estimates of the probable cleanup, investigation, and remediation costs based on available information at known locations and projects compared with locations and projects at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, sites accounted for million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. We anticipate that most of this liability will be paid out over ; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. 
 
 At locations, one or more of our subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under CERCLA or comparable state statutes that impose joint and 
 
 23 

of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA), these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the RLA are completed. Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements. We largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee. 
 
 Under current moratorium provisions, neither party can serve notice to compel a new round of mandatory collective bargaining until November 1, 2024. That said, over the past several months, we engaged in voluntary local discussions with our labor unions and, as a result, reached local tentative agreements with a majority of our unions prior to the opening of the national bargaining round. These new tentative agreements are subject to ratification by union membership. If ratified, they will take effect January 1, 2025, and will foreclose the parties from serving new notices to compel mandatory bargaining until November 1, 2029. 
 
 We will continue local discussions with the unions with whom we have not yet reached agreement. If no local agreement has been reached with one or more of these unions when the moratoriums in their contracts expire on November 1, 2024, the parties will exchange bargaining notices and commence mandatory direct negotiations as prescribed under the RLA. Even if the parties are unable to reach voluntary agreement during this first phase of RLA-bargaining, self-help (e.g., a strike or other work stoppage) related to this collective bargaining process remains prohibited by law until a lengthy series of additional procedures mandated by the RLA, including federal mediation, are exhausted. 
 
 Insurance 
 
 We purchase insurance covering legal liabilities for bodily injury and property damage to third parties. Our current 
 
 24 

of covered losses above million and below million per occurrence and/or policy year. In addition, we purchase insurance for damage to property owned by us or in our care, custody, or control. Our current property insurance provides limits for approximately of covered losses above million and below million per occurrence and/or policy year. With respect to the Incident, our insurance in effect at such time provided coverage above million and below million (or up to billion for specified types of pollution releases) per occurrence and/or policy year, and with respect to property owned by us or in our care, custody, or control, our insurance covered approximately of potential losses above million and below million per occurrence and/or policy year. 
 
 Insurance coverage with respect to the Incident is subject to certain conditions, including but not limited to our insurers reservation of rights to further investigate and contest coverage, the express restrictions and sub-limits of coverage, and various policy exclusions, including those for some governmental fines or penalties. Some (re)insurers have questioned certain payments we have made, for example, as part of our effort to respond to, mitigate, and compensate for the impact to the community and affected residents and businesses. We are pursuing coverage with respect to the Incident, and we have recognized million in insurance recoveries (including million and million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023), principally from excess liability (re)insurers. At September 30, 2024, million was outstanding and is included in Accounts receivable net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2023.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are one of the nation s premier transportation companies, moving goods and materials that help drive the U.S. economy. We connect customers to markets and communities to economic opportunity with safe, reliable, and cost-effective shipping solutions. Our Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates in 22 states and the District of Columbia. We are a major transporter of industrial products, including agriculture, forest and consumer products, chemicals, and metals and construction materials. In addition, in the East we serve every major container port and operate the most extensive intermodal network. We are also a principal carrier of coal, automobiles, and automotive parts. 
 
 Our focus on providing high-quality service to our customers and delivering on productivity initiatives throughout the organization resulted in improved operating margins and financial results. We are driving improvements in our operational performance while handling additional volumes. We also completed the sale of two railway lines that resulted in significant gains and cash proceeds and executed on further strategic rationalization efforts, primarily aimed at technology projects. Additionally, insurance recoveries related to the Eastern Ohio Incident (as defined further and described in Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) outpaced incremental expenses further impacting our financial results. In the third quarter, we achieved an operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) of 47.7 , and an adjusted operating ratio of 63.4 (see our non-GAAP reconciliations beginning on page 27). Our margin improvement demonstrates our commitment to being a more productive, resilient, and efficient railroad with industry-competitive margins. 

SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change in millions, except per share amounts) Railway operating revenues 3,051 2,971 3 9,099 9,083 Railway operating expenses 1,455 2,215 (34 6,159 7,040 (13 Income from railway operations 1,596 756 111 2,940 2,043 44 Net income 1,099 478 130 1,889 1,300 45 Diluted earnings per share 4.85 2.10 131 8.34 5.70 46 Railway operating ratio (percent) 47.7 74.6 (36 67.7 77.5 (13 
 
 Income from railway operations increased in both periods, primarily as a result of lower railway operating expenses, including 380 million of gains on railway line sales and lower net costs related to the Eastern Ohio Incident, with insurance recoveries exceeding incremental Incident-related expenses in the third quarter. Our financial results in both periods also reflect higher railway operating revenues, driven by increased volumes that were partially offset by an adverse mix of traffic, lower fuel surcharge revenues, and decreased pricing. Our net income and diluted earnings per share were up significantly in the third quarter and first nine months. 
 
 The following tables adjust our GAAP financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 to exclude gains on railway line sales, restructuring and other charges (including the curtailment gain on our other 
 
 26 

postretirement benefit plan which is included in Other income net in the first nine months), the effects of the Incident, shareholder advisory costs, and a deferred income tax adjustment. The income tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments were calculated based on the applicable tax rates to which the non-GAAP adjustments related. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making period-to-period comparisons by excluding these items. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

 On an adjusted basis, income from railway operations increased in both the third quarter and first nine months. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by lower adjusted railway operating expenses. The decline in adjusted railway operating expenses in both periods reflects lower fuel prices and higher gains on operating property sales, partly offset by increased depreciation on our higher asset base. Third quarter adjusted railway operating expenses also decreased due to lower employee activity levels and a decline in purchased services spend. Additionally, 
 
 28 

adjusted income from railway operations increased in both periods as a result of higher railway operating revenues, driven by an increase in volume but partially offset by an adverse mix of traffic, lower fuel surcharge revenues, and decreased pricing. 

DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Railway Operating Revenues 
 
 The following tables present a comparison of revenues in millions), units (in thousands), and average revenue per unit per unit) by commodity group.

Railway operating revenues increased 80 million in the third quarter and 16 million for the first nine months compared with the same periods last year. The table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group in millions). 
 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months Merchandise Intermodal Coal Merchandise Intermodal Coal Increase (Decrease) Volume 28 66 49 54 194 24 Fuel surcharge revenue (1) (9) 1 (79) (56) (17) Rate, mix and other 34 (31) (57) 149 (184) (69) Total 61 26 (7) 124 (46) (62) 
 
 Approximately 95 of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges. Revenues associated with these surcharges totaled 238 million and 247 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 757 million and 909 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in fuel surcharge revenues is driven by lower fuel commodity prices. 
 
 For the remainder of 2024, we expect that revenue will decline compared to 2023, as the impacts of lower fuel surcharge revenue, decreased pricing, and adverse traffic mix will offset increased volume. 
 
 Merchandise 
 
 Merchandise revenues increased in both periods due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by increased pricing partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue, and increased volume. 
 
 Agriculture, forest and consumer products volume increased in the third quarter and was flat for the first nine months. Both periods had higher volume in corn, soybeans, and feed. Increased corn and feed volumes were the result of customers shifting from truck to rail service to meet market demands. Soybean volume increased due to spot opportunities. The first nine months were offset by a decline in fertilizer volume due to lower potash shipments due to customer operational issues. 
 
 Chemicals volume increased in both the third quarter and first nine months. Both periods saw increased volume in organic chemicals, plastics, and solid waste due to stronger demand. Petroleum products and crude oil volume decreased in both periods. Volume declines in petroleum were related to the conclusion of a spot opportunity handled last year to support a customer during a refinery outage, while declines in crude oil were due to a market share shift. 
 
 Metals and construction volume decreased in the third quarter but increased for the first nine months. The third quarter decreased due to lower coil steel and aggregates shipments. Coil steel volume decreased due to lower demand and aggregates volume decreased due to inclement weather impacting paving operations and construction sites in the southeast market. The first nine months increased due to higher demand in aggregates, iron and steel, kaolin, and miscellaneous construction. 
 
 Automotive volumes decreased in the third quarter but increased in the first nine months. The third quarter decreased due to reduced production, quality holds at the manufacturers and extended plant shutdowns. The first nine months increased due to improvements in equipment availability and their cycle time paired with higher demand, partially offset by reduced production and quality holds at the manufacturers and extended plant shutdowns. 
 
 30 

Intermodal 
 
 Intermodal revenues increased in the third quarter but decreased for the first nine months. The third quarter increased due to higher volumes partially offset by lower average revenue per unit, driven by decreased pricing, adverse mix, and lower fuel surcharge revenue. The decline in the first nine months was driven by lower average revenue per unit, driven by decreased pricing, lower fuel surcharge revenue, adverse mix, and declines in storage service charges, partially offset by higher volume. 
 
 Intermodal units (in thousands) by market were as follows: 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change Domestic 637.7 583.1 9 1,844.4 1,747.8 6 International 414.5 382.3 8 1,200.1 1,059.8 13 Total 1,052.2 965.4 9 3,044.5 2,807.6 8 
 
 Domestic volume increased in both periods due to growth in existing customers and improved service, partially offset by reduced demand for premium shipments. International volume rose in both periods, driven by increased demand, growth in existing customers, and increased movements of empty containers. 
 
 Coal 
 
 Coal revenues decreased in both periods. Both periods decreased due to lower average revenue per unit driven by pricing, and for the first nine months, lower fuel surcharge revenue. The decrease in average revenue per unit in both periods was partially offset by increased volume. 
 
 Coal tonnage (in thousands) by market was as follows: 
 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change Utility 8,272 7,342 13 22,846 22,404 2 Export 8,816 7,563 17 24,812 23,466 6 Domestic metallurgical 2,706 2,906 (7 7,472 8,296 (10 Industrial 991 913 9 2,640 2,484 6 Total 20,785 18,724 11 57,770 56,650 2 
 
 Utility tonnage increased in both periods primarily due to customer outages in the prior year. Export tonnage increased in both periods due to growth with our customers and increased production in the third quarter. These items, which more than offset the temporary closure of the Baltimore port which limited export opportunities through that location in the second quarter, impacted the first nine months volumes. Industrial coal tonnage increased in both periods due to higher demand. Domestic metallurgical tonnage decreased in both periods as a result of reduced customer demand.

Railway Operating Expenses 
 
 Railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications follow in millions): 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change Compensation and benefits 690 715 (3 2,126 2,098 1 Purchased services and rents 497 517 (4 1,541 1,519 1 Fuel 216 289 (25 757 867 (13 Depreciation 339 326 4 1,011 968 4 Materials and other (188) 205 (192 200 622 (68 Restructuring and other charges 60 156 Eastern Ohio incident (159) 163 (198 368 966 (62 Total 1,455 2,215 (34 6,159 7,040 (13 
 
 Compensation and benefits expense decreased in the third quarter but increased in the first nine months as follows: 
 
 employee activity levels (down 35 million for the quarter and 10 million for the first nine months), 
 overtime (down 12 million for the quarter and 26 million for the first nine months), 
 incentive compensation (up 11 million for the quarter and 31 million for the first nine months), 
 pay rates (up 25 million for the quarter and 66 million for the first nine months), and 
 other (down 14 million for the quarter and 33 million for the first nine months). 
 
 Average rail headcount for the quarter was down by 560 compared with the third quarter of 2023 due to lower train and engine and management headcount, partially offset by hiring of additional non-train and engine craft employees. 
 
 Purchased services and rents decreased in the third quarter but increased in the first nine months as follows in millions): 
 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change Purchased services 405 426 (5 1,244 1,232 1 Equipment rents 92 91 1 297 287 3 Total 497 517 (4 1,541 1,519 1 
 
 Purchased services decreased in the third quarter but increased in the first nine months. The third quarter decreased due to lower operational and technology-related costs as well as lower lease costs, which were partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. The first nine months increased due to higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by lower lease costs and lower operational and technology-related expenses. Equipment rents increased in both periods due to higher intermodal equipment expense as a result of higher volumes. 

32 

Fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations decreased in both periods. Locomotive fuel consumption was down 1 in the third quarter and flat for the first nine months. Locomotive fuel price decreased in both periods (down 25 in the third quarter and 12 for the first nine months). 
 
 Depreciation expense increased in both periods due to a higher asset base. 
 
 Materials and other expenses decreased in both periods as follows in millions):

 Materials expense increased in both periods due to higher freight car repairs expense. Claims expense increased in the third quarter but decreased for the first nine months. The increase in the third quarter was a result of higher costs associated with derailments. Both periods include decreased costs associated with personal injury claims partially offset by a prior year claims-related recovery. Other expense decreased in both periods due to increased gains from operating property sales, lower travel and relocation-related expenses, and lower non-income-based taxes. Gains from operating property sales includes 380 million of gains on the sale of railway lines in the states of Virginia and North Carolina that occurred in the third quarter. These transactions are described further in Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total gains from operating property sales, included in Other, were 400 million and 8 million for the third quarter in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 425 million and 30 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Restructuring and other charges 
 
 Restructuring and other charges were 60 million in the third quarter of 2024 and relate to expenses associated with the rationalization of certain software development projects that had not been placed into service as well as expense associated with reflecting certain equipment at its net realizable value in advance of the planned disposition of that asset class. For the first nine months of 2024, these expenses totaled 156 million, as they also include 96 million of costs associated with our voluntary and involuntary separation programs that reduced our management workforce and costs incurred in connection with the appointment of our chief operating officer. 
 
 Eastern Ohio incident 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, our insurance recoveries exceeded additional Incident-related expenses by 159 million as compared to 163 million in expenses, net of insurance proceeds, for the same period last year. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we incurred expenses of 368 million and 966 million, respectively, for costs associated with the Incident, net of insurance recoveries. Our cash expenditures attributable to the Incident, net of insurance proceeds received, were 32 million and 511 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are presented in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For further details regarding the Incident, see Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

33 

Other income net 
 
 Other income net decreased 6 million in the third quarter and 84 million for the first nine months. The third quarter decrease is due to lower interest income. The decline in the first nine months reflects costs associated with shareholder matters, lower returns on COLI, and higher pension and postretirement benefits expense, partially offset by a 20 million curtailment gain on our other postretirement benefit plan as a result of our voluntary and involuntary separation programs. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate was 23.0 and 21.3 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with 22.1 for those same periods last year. The rate for the first nine months of 2024 reflects a 13 million deferred income tax benefit due to a change in a state corporate income tax rate and a 27 million deferred income tax benefit from subsidiary restructuring. These benefits were partially offset by the absence of certain business tax credits recognized in the prior year. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities, our principal source of liquidity, was 3.1 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 2.5 billion for the same period of 2023. We had negative working capital of 987 million at September 30, 2024 and working capital of 639 million at December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 975 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 2.8 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 1.4 billion for the same period last year. The increase was driven by the acquisition of the assets of the CSR as well as increased property additions, partially offset by increased proceeds from property sales. Please see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on certain railway line sales and Note 10 for a detailed discussion of the acquisition of the CSR assets. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 903 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 62 million for the same period last year, reflecting lower proceeds from borrowing partially offset by lower repurchases of Common Stock. We did not repurchase any Common Stock during the first nine months of 2024, while we repurchased 503 million during the same period last year. The timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors. Repurchases may be executed in the open market, through derivatives, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally-generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings. 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into an agreement that provides us the ability to issue up to 800 million of unsecured commercial paper and is backed by our credit agreement. The unsecured short-term commercial paper program provides for borrowing at prevailing rates and includes covenants. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding commercial paper. 
 
 In May 2024, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program with a maximum borrowing capacity of 400 million. Amounts under our accounts receivable securitization program are borrowed and repaid from time to time in the ordinary course for general corporate and cash management purposes. The term of our accounts receivable securitization program expires in May 2025. We had no amounts outstanding under this program and our available borrowing capacity was 400 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 In January 2024, we renewed and amended our 800 million credit agreement. The amended agreement expires in January 2029, and provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants. We had no amounts 
 
 34 

outstanding under this facility at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and we are in compliance with all of its covenants. 
 
 In January 2024, we also entered into a term loan credit agreement that established a 364-day, 1.0 billion, unsecured delayed draw term loan facility under which we can borrow for general corporate purposes. The term loan credit agreement provides for borrowing at prevailing rates and includes covenants that align with our 800 million credit agreement. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2024. During July 2024, we extended the availability period of the term loan agreement. The term loan expired undrawn on October 22, 2024. 
 
 In addition, we have investments in general purpose COLI policies and have the ability to borrow against these policies. We had no amounts outstanding at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our remaining borrowing capacity was 625 million and 640 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 55.5 at September 30, 2024 and 57.3 at December 31, 2023. We expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations. In addition, we believe our currently-available borrowing capacity, access to additional financing, and ability to decrease shareholder distributions, provide additional flexibility to meet our ongoing obligations. There have been no material changes to the information on future contractual obligations, including those that may have material cash requirements, contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except that on April 9, 2024, we announced that we reached an agreement in principle to settle the Ohio Class Action for 600 million. On September 27, 2024, the court granted final approval of the settlement. We made a partial payment of the settlement on October 11, 2024 in the amount of 310 million and the remaining balance could be paid as early as November 8, 2024; however, that payment, including timing, is dependent upon resolution of any appeals to the settlement. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates contained in our Form 10-K at December 31, 2023. 

OTHER MATTERS 
 
 Labor Agreements 
 
 Approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Pursuant to the RLA, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the RLA are completed. Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements. We largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee. 
 
 Under current moratorium provisions, neither party can serve notice to compel a new round of mandatory collective bargaining until November 1, 2024. That said, over the past several months, we engaged in voluntary local discussions with our labor unions and, as a result, reached local tentative agreements with a majority of our unions prior to the opening of the national bargaining round. These new tentative agreements are subject to ratification by 
 
 35 

union membership. If ratified, they will take effect January 1, 2025, and will foreclose the parties from serving new notices to compel mandatory bargaining until November 1, 2029. 
 
 We will continue local discussions with the unions with whom we have not yet reached agreement. If no local agreement has been reached with one or more of these unions when the moratoriums in their contracts expire on November 1, 2024, the parties will exchange bargaining notices and commence mandatory direct negotiations as prescribed under the RLA. Even if the parties are unable to reach voluntary agreement during this first phase of RLA bargaining, self-help (e.g., a strike or other work stoppage) related to this collective bargaining process remains prohibited by law until a lengthy series of additional procedures mandated by the RLA, including federal mediation, are exhausted. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 In preparing financial statements, GAAP requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. As a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, will, could, would, should, expect, plan, anticipate, intend, believe, estimate, project, consider, predict, potential, feel, or other comparable terminology. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control. These and other important factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors in our latest Form 10-K as well as our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
