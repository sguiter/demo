Liquidity and Management s Plans 
 The Company s convertible senior promissory notes are due January 1, 2025. As described more fully in Note 12, the Company recently took steps to improve its liquidity and temporarily make certain debt covenants more favorable to the Company. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under Amendment No. 8 to the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 4) but determined it may need additional capital and/or relief from the financial covenants in the future. On November 11, 2024, the Company and Oaktree (as defined in Note 4) executed Amendment No. 9 to the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 12), which provided the Company with revised financial covenants through June 30, 2026, permitted the Company to enter into the Rights Offering Term Sheet, and the Pre-Owned Floor Plan Facility and SLB Commitment Letter (each as defined in Note 12), and permit the Company to pay the convertible senior promissory notes due January 1, 2025. 
 As a result of the Rights Offering Term Sheet and the Pre-Owned Floor Plan Facility and SLB Commitment Letter, which collectively represent million of incremental capital, and Amendment No. 9, the Company believes that it will be in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 9, for the next one-year period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has classified obligations under the Credit Agreement as non-current liabilities. 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with the Minimum EBITDA financial covenant associated with its JPM Credit Line (as defined in Note 4). On October 23, 2024, the Company paid the outstanding balance under its JPM Credit Line, which was million as of September 30, 2024. As of November 1, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, amounts may be borrowed under this credit line.

million on its convertible secured senior notes and therefore no longer recognizes any amortization of such debt discount as interest expense. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company reclassified the million unamortized debt discount from additional paid-in-capital to long-term debt and also recorded a million cumulative adjustment credit to retained earnings for amortization from the issuance date through January 1, 2024 with an offset to additional paid-in-capital. The impact of our adoption of this standard was approximately per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflected the reduction of non-cash interest expense. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. 
 Recent Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
 Issued in November 2023, ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ). The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal year 2024 and interim periods beginning in 2025, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard beginning with our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we expect only an impact to our disclosures, which will be made on a retrospective basis, with no impact to our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
 Issued in December 2023, ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , focuses on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU requires disclosure, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, the ASU requires disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5 of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. The new standard is effective for the Company for 2025, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all periods presented. We expect this ASU to only impact our disclosures with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

 Term Loan Credit Agreement 
 The Company has a term loan credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent Oaktree ). Other than certain interest that is payable in kind PIK at the Company's option, no additional amounts are available to be borrowed under the Credit Agreement. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal, at the Company s option, to either (a) SOFR (with a floor of ), plus an applicable margin of or (b) a fluctuating adjusted base rate in effect from time to time, plus an applicable margin of , provided that Amendment No. 8 (as defined below) extended the additional of interest that was put in place as part of Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement through March 31, 2025. At the Company s option, up to of interest, including the of additional interest, may be payable in kind. The interest rate on September 30, 2024, was , including the additional of interest that the Company has elected to pay in kind. 
 Obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors ), although certain assets of the Company and Subsidiary Guarantors are subject to a first-priority lien in favor of floor plan lenders, and such liens and priority are subject to certain other exceptions. The Subsidiary Guarantors also guarantee the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid million in principal under the Credit Agreement. The Company provided customary representations and covenants under the Credit Agreement, which include financial covenants and collateral performance covenants.

million to million starting June 30, 2024 and continuing through the maturity of the term loan, and (iii) a compliance certificate is required to be submitted affirming compliance with the then effective leverage and liquidity tests upon any full or partial cash settlement of the convertible senior promissory notes due January 1, 2025. 
 Amendment No. 8 was made effective as of June 30, 2024, and the lenders agreed in Amendment No. 8 that no event of default exists or arises from such financial covenants as of such date. The Company agreed to pay a one-time fee of of the loan amount in cash, and the additional of interest was extended through March 31, 2025. 
 The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024; however, financial projections indicated that more liquidity may be needed to ensure that the Company maintains compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant. As more fully discussed in Note 12, on November 11, 2024, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto, Oaktree and the lenders party thereto executed Amendment No. 9 to the Credit Agreement, which among other things, revised applicable leverage ratios, permitted the Company to enter into the Rights Offering Term Sheet and the Pre-Owned Floor Plan Facility and SLB Commitment Letter (each as defined in Note 12), and permit the Company to pay the convertible senior promissory notes due January 1, 2025. The additional of interest previously extended through March 31, 2025 will terminate on December 31, 2024. 
 Based on the amended terms of the Credit Agreement and the million of capital commitments made by certain related parties as discussed in Note 1, the Company believes that it will be in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 9, for the next one-year period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has classified obligations under the Credit Agreement as non-current liabilities. 
 RumbleOn Finance Line of Credit 
 As disclosed in the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K, on January 2, 2024, the Company repaid the entire balance due under this loan from cash proceeds from the 2023 sale of the loan portfolio held at RumbleOn Finance. This line of credit was then terminated. 
 Vehicle Floor Plan Notes Payable 
 Vehicle floor plan notes payable are classified as current liabilities. Floor plan notes payable (trade) reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, pre-owned powersports vehicle inventory with corresponding manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries trade lenders ). Floor plan notes payable (non-trade) represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and pre-owned powersports vehicle inventories with non-trade lenders. Changes in vehicle floor plan notes payable (trade) are reported as operating cash flows, and changes in floor plan notes payable (non-trade) are reported as financing cash flows in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Inventory serves as collateral under vehicle floor plan notes payable borrowings. 
 New inventory costs are generally reduced by manufacturer holdbacks, incentives, floor plan assistance, and non-reimbursement-based manufacturer advertising rebates, while the related vehicle floor plan payables are reflective of the gross cost of the powersports vehicle. The vehicle floor plan payables will generally also be higher than the inventory cost due to the timing of the sale of a vehicle and payment of the related liability. Vehicle floor plan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within a few business days after the related vehicles are sold. 
 New vehicle floor plan facilities generally utilize SOFR or ADB (Average Daily Balance)-based interest rates while pre-owned vehicle floor plan facilities are based on prime or SOFR. The aggregate capacity to finance our inventory under the new and pre-owned vehicle floor plan facilities as of September 30, 2024 was million, of which million was used.

 Overview 
 RumbleOn, Inc. operates primarily through two operating segments: our powersports dealership group and Wholesale Express, LLC Express ), a vehicle transportation services provider. We were incorporated in 2013.

Recent Developments 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under Amendment No.8 to the Credit Agreement (defined in Note 4) but determined it may need additional capital and/or relief from the financial covenants in the future. On November 11, 2024, the Company and Oaktree executed Amendment No. 9 to the Credit Agreement (each as defined in Note 12), which provided the Company with revised financial covenants through June 30, 2026, and permitted the Company to enter into the Rights Offering Term Sheet and the Pre-Owned Floor Plan Facility and SLB Commitment Letter (each as defined in Note 12), representing a total of approximately 30.0 million of incremental capital. 
 J.P. Morgan Floor Plan Line 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with the Minimum EBITDA financial covenant associated with its JPM Credit Line (as defined in Note 4). On October 23, 2024, the Company paid off the outstanding balance under this floor plan line, which was 5.7 million as of September 30, 2024. This floor plan line terminates on December 31, 2024, and no amounts may be drawn under the line after November 1, 2024. 

Key Operating Metrics 
 We regularly review a number of key operating metrics to evaluate our segments, measure our progress, and make operating decisions. Our key operating metrics reflect what we believe will be the primary drivers of our business, including increasing brand awareness, maximizing the opportunity to source vehicles from consumers and dealers, and enhancing the selection and timing of vehicles we make available for sale to our customers. 
 Powersports Segment 
 Revenue 
 Revenue is comprised of powersports vehicle sales, finance and insurance products bundled with retail vehicle sales F I ), and parts, service and accessories/merchandise PSA ). We sell both new and pre-owned powersports vehicles through retail and wholesale channels. F I and PSA revenue is earned through retail channels. Retail channels provide the opportunity to maximize profitability by increased sales volume and lower average days to sale and are impacted by customer demand, market conditions and inventory availability. The wholesale channel provides the opportunity to move excess inventory or inventory that does not meet our needs for retail. The number of vehicles sold varies from period to period due to these factors. Factors primarily affecting pre-owned vehicle sales include inventory levels and the availability of inventory, as well as the number of retail pre-owned vehicles sold and the average selling price of these vehicles. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit generated on vehicle sales reflects the difference between the vehicle selling price and the cost of revenue associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. Cost of revenue includes the vehicle acquisition cost, inbound transportation cost, and particularly for pre-owned vehicles, reconditioning costs. The aggregate gross profit and gross profit per vehicle vary across vehicle type, make, model, etc. as well as through retail and wholesale channels, and with regard to gross profit per vehicle, are not necessarily correlated with the sale price. Vehicles sold through retail channels generally have the highest dollar gross profit per vehicle given the vehicle is sold directly to the consumer. Pre-owned vehicles sold through wholesale channels generally have lower margins and do not enable any other ancillary gross profit attributable to financing and accessories. Factors affecting gross profit from period to period include the mix of new versus pre-owned vehicles sold, the distribution channel through which they are sold, the sources from which we acquired such inventory, retail market prices, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may opportunistically choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of demand/supply imbalances in our sales channels, which could temporarily lead to gross profits increasing or decreasing in any given channel.

Table of Contents 

Vehicles Sold 
 We define vehicles sold as the number of vehicles sold through retail and wholesale channels in each period. Vehicles sold is the primary driver of our revenue and gross profit. Vehicles sold also impacts complementary revenue streams, such as F I and PSA. Vehicles sold increases our base of customers and improves brand awareness, which can lead to future sales. 
 Total Gross Profit Per Unit 
 Total gross profit per unit is the aggregate gross profit of the powersports segment in a given period, divided by retail powersports units sold in that period. The aggregate gross profit of the powersports segment includes gross profit generated from the sale of new and pre-owned vehicles; any income related to loans originated to finance the vehicle; revenue earned from the sale of F I products including extended service contracts, maintenance programs, guaranteed auto protection, tire and wheel protection, and theft protection; gross profit on the sale of parts, service and accessories/merchandise; and gross profit generated from wholesale sales of vehicles. 
 Vehicle Transportation Services Segment 
 Revenue 
 Revenue is derived from freight brokerage agreements with dealers, distributors, or private party individuals to transport vehicles from a point of origin to a designated destination. The freight brokerage agreements are fulfilled by independent third-party transporters who must meet our performance obligations and standards. Express is considered the principal in the delivery transactions since it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the service. 
 Vehicles Delivered 
 We define vehicles delivered as the number of vehicles delivered from a point of origin to a designated destination under freight brokerage agreements with dealers, distributors, or private parties. Vehicles delivered are the primary driver of revenue and, in turn, profitability in the vehicle transportation services segment. 
 Total Gross Profit Per Unit 
 Total gross profit per vehicle transported represents the difference between the price received from non-affiliated customers and our cost to contract an independent third-party transporter divided by the number of third-party vehicles transported.

Revenue 
 Total powersports revenue for the quarter decreased 44.2 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower volume of vehicle units sold. The impact on revenue from the volume was partially offset by a 397 increase in average revenue per new vehicle sold. The lower volume in retail sales of new and pre-owned vehicles contributed to a decline in F I and PSA revenue for the quarter. 
 Total powersports revenue decreased 117.0 million for the nine months of 2024, with the decrease coming primarily from lower sales of vehicles in the retail channel. The impact on revenue from lower volume was partially offset by higher revenue per new vehicle sold. 
 Gross Profit 
 Total powersports gross profit decreased 17.8 million for the quarter and 41.7 million for the nine months of 2024. Lower sales volumes drove the decline in gross profit for both the quarter and nine months of 2024. Industry pressures as well as our efforts to reduce inventory more in line with our sales levels resulted in compressed gross profit for powersports.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A as a percentage of gross profit improved 370 basis points for the quarter. SG A decreased primarily due to our cost savings initiatives. Compensation and related costs comprised the majority of the savings. The expense reduction for the quarter was partially offset by higher legal costs included in professional fees for the matters discussed in Note 11. The prior year quarter included certain costs that did not recur in 2024: 0.6 million related to the separation of former executives, 0.4 million related to a proxy contest and reorganization of the board of directors, and a 0.6 million loss associated with the loan receivable portfolio that was sold at the end of 2023. 
 SG A as a percentage of gross profit improved 850 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. SG A decreased primarily due to our cost savings initiatives, as well as certain expenses in 2023 that did not recur in 2024. Facilities expense in the nine months of 2024 included a 0.9 million gain on the partial termination of a warehouse lease that was no longer needed. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 5.1 million of charges related to a proxy contest and reorganization of our board of directors, 5.3 million of personnel restructuring costs primarily associated with officer separations from the Company, and 6.0 million of charges associated with the RumbleOn Finance loan portfolio that was sold at the end of 2023.

 Other interest expense consists primarily of interest and deferred financing costs on the: (i) term loan facility; (ii) convertible senior notes; (iii) finance lease obligation; and in 2023, (iv) the ROF Consumer Finance Facility. Interest expense decreased for the quarter and nine months of 2024 due primarily to lower outstanding principal on the term loan facility and the RumbleOn Finance consumer finance facility being paid off at the beginning of 2024, offset by interest expense on the finance lease obligation that was entered into in September 2023. Other interest expense was also lower due to our adoption of ASU 2020-06, as we are no longer amortizing the debt discount associated with our convertible senior notes. See Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, f or more details on our adoption of the new accounting standard and Note 4, Debt, for more detail on the components of our other interest expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are available cash and amounts available under our floor plan lines of credit. 
 Our financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the carrying values of the Company s assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The judgments, assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience, management s experience, and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ materially from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of the Company s assets and liabilities and the results of operations. 
 We had the following liquidity resources available as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash 50.1 58.9 Restricted cash (1)

 121.5 165.0 Committed liquidity resources available 188.2 242.0 
 (1) Amounts included in restricted cash are primarily comprised of the deposits required under the Company's various floor plan lines of credit. 
 (2) Aggregate availability at December 31, 2023 included 47.5 million for the JPM Credit Line (as defined below) that was reduced to 8.0 million as of September 30, 2024. During October 2024, aggregate credit availability was reduced by 22.8 million as a result of our lowering of limits with certain lenders and the reduction of the limits under the JPM Credit Line. Subsequent to November 1, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, no new amounts may be borrowed under the JPM Credit Line. 
 
 At June 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with certain leverage ratio financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. On August 6, 2024, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto, Oaktree and the lenders party thereto executed Amendment No. 8 to the Credit Agreement Amendment No. 8 ), pursuant to which, among other things: (i) the leverage ratios were revised and made less restrictive through December 31, 2024, (ii) the level of liquidity required by the minimum liquidity covenant was increased from 25.0 million to 30.0 million starting June 30, 2024 and continuing through the maturity of the term loan, and (iii) a compliance certificate is required to be submitted affirming compliance with the then effective leverage and liquidity tests upon any full or partial cash settlement of the convertible senior 6.75 promissory notes due January 1, 2025. The Company agreed to pay a one-time fee of 0.5 of the loan amount in cash, and the additional 0.5 of interest was extended through March 31, 2025.

Included in the availability under powersports inventory financing credit facilities as of September 30, 2024 was the JPM Credit Line with an advance limit of 8.0 million, of which 5.7 million was used. The JPM Credit Line was amended on August 6, 2024 after the Company was not in compliance with the Minimum EBITDA financial covenant as of June 30, 2024. The amendment revised applicable financial covenants for the remainder of its term, reduced the commitment level, reduced the advance rate of incremental floored units from 75 to 65 of cost, and extended the term from October 25, 2024 to December 31, 2024. On October 23, 2024, the Company paid off the outstanding balance under the JPM Credit Line. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, no amounts are available to be borrowed under this line after November 1, 2024. 
 The Company executed Amendment No. 9 to the Credit Agreement, the Rights Offering Term Sheet and the Pre-Owned Floor Plan Facility and SLB Commitment Letter on November 11, 2024, as discussed more fully in Note 12. 
 Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including our results of operations, the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures or strategic initiatives, and other business and risk factors described under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as amended and supplemented in subsequent filings. We believe that current cash balances plus cash generated from operations and capital commitments received in November 2024 will be sufficient to meet both the operating and capital requirements of our ordinary business operations through at least the next twelve months; however, there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame.

Operating Activities 
 Our primary sources of operating cash flows result from the sales of powersports vehicles and ancillary products. Our primary use of cash from operating activities are purchases of inventory, parts and merchandise; marketing costs; interest payments on trade floor plans, long-term debt, and finance lease obligations; rental costs for facilities; and personnel-related expenses. Operating cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 were 87.1 million better than in the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting the Company s improved operating performance, primarily driven by our efforts to reduce inventory days on hand, the benefit of our cost savings initiatives and the settlement of the sale of the RumbleOn Finance loan portfolio.

 Cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to our short and long-term debt activity. In the first nine months of this year, cash used in financing activities was higher in 2024 primarily due to a reduction in non-trade floor plan borrowings. The prior year also included the proceeds from a sale-leaseback transaction.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us, contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, plans, predicts, projects, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. These forward-looking statements are based on our current, reasonable expectations and assumptions, which expectations and assumptions are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise or any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, based on the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses identified in the 2023 Form 10-K. The material weaknesses existing in our internal control over financial reporting relate to: 
 As previously disclosed, there was an insufficient number of accounting resources to facilitate an effective control environment following the integration of the RideNow business and incorporation of the acquired business into the Company s control environment. Consequently, the Company did not effectively operate process-level control activities related to elimination of intercompany transactions; review and approval of account reconciliations, payroll, and journal entries; review and approval of accounting estimates; and execution and documentation of management review controls, including but not limited to evaluating debt covenants, and assumptions included in the Company s annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment. 
 In the areas of user access and segregation of duties related to certain information technology systems that support the Company s financial reporting processes, resulting in ineffective journal entry and other manual controls. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

As set forth below, management has taken and will continue to take steps to remediate the identified material weakness. Notwithstanding the material weakness, we have performed additional analyses and procedures to enable management to conclude that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the periods presented. 
 Management s Remediation Plan 
 In response to the material weakness discussed above, we plan to continue efforts already underway to remediate internal control over financial reporting, which include the following: 
 
 We are committed to hiring additional accounting resources with the required technical expertise and clearly defined roles responsibilities; 
 We continue to evaluate system enhancements to automate the consolidation and elimination of intercompany transactions; 
 We continue to enhance the overall review and approval process relating to elimination of intercompany transactions; 
 We continue to enhance the review and approval controls related to reconciling certain accruals and accounting estimates and assumptions; 
 We are in the process of conducting additional training on the Company's document retention policies; 
 We are enhancing our processes around reviewing privileged access to key financial systems and ensuring appropriate segregation of duties; and 
 We continue to enhance governance and reporting over the execution of these remediation action items, including expansion of mitigating controls where appropriate. 
 
 Management and our Audit Committee will monitor these specific remedial measures and the effectiveness of our overall control environment. A material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We can provide no assurance as to when the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed to provide for an effective control environment. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints that require management to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not a party to any material legal proceedings as set forth in Item 103 of Regulation S-K, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business and as set forth below. 
 SEC Investigation 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents created during or relating to the period from January 1, 2021 through the date of the subpoena. The subpoena covers documents relating to, among other matters, the Company s previously disclosed internal investigation into the use of Company resources by Marshall Chesrown; the Company s review, consideration and approval, and the underlying terms of, related party transactions; employment, compensation, reimbursement and severance arrangements; and disclosures and communications to customers and investors regarding the Company s cash offer tool and certain of its technology. The Company continues to cooperate with the SEC s inquiry. 
 The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome or timing of the SEC investigation, what, if any, actions may be taken by the SEC, or the effect that such actions may have on the business, prospects, operating results and financial condition of the Company. 
 Internal Investigation and Delaware Litigation 
 As previously disclosed, the Company began an investigation of certain allegations surrounding Marshall Chesrown s use of Company resources in 2023. On July 7, 2023, Mr. Chesrown provided the Board a letter of resignation (the Resignation Letter describing Mr. Chesrown s disagreement with several recent corporate governance, disclosure and other actions taken by the Company, the Board and certain of its members, and indicated his intent to pursue legal claims. The Company disagrees with the characterization of the allegations and assertions described in the Resignation Letter. The Company and Mr. Chesrown conducted a pre-suit mediation in October 2023, as required in his employment agreement, but did not resolve the matter. On March 13, 2024, Mr. Chesrown filed suit against the Company in Delaware Superior Court for the claims asserted in his Resignation Letter. Mr. Chesrown is seeking a declaratory judgment that he resigned with good reason, termination compensation damages in the amount of 7.5 million, general and reputational damages in the amount of 50 million, punitive damages, attorney's fees and litigation costs. The parties are now engaged in the initial stages of discovery. The subject matter of the litigation overlaps with the investigation begun by the Company in 2023. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not decided what actions, if any, may be taken with regard to the investigation allegations. We intend to defend the litigation claims vigorously; however, we can provide no assurance regarding the outcome of this matter.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K. The information provided below updates the disclosure to the 2023 Form 10-K regarding certain financial risks affecting the Company. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. 
 Financial Risks 
 We have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including our business flexibility. 
 We have a substantial amount of debt, which has had and will continue to have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. We have various operating and financial covenants under our debt agreements that may limit our operating flexibility due to the need to manage operations with a view to satisfying these covenants at the applicable date of determination. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur a substantial amount of interest expense. Our level of indebtedness, including the applicable interest payments, could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to competitors with lower debt levels. If our financial performance does not meet our current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted. 
 At June 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with certain leverage ratio financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of such date. On August 6, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 8 to the Credit Agreement, which, among other things, revised the applicable leverage ratios, increased the minimum liquidity covenant, required a compliance certificate to be delivered upon any full or partial cash settlement of the convertible senior 6.75 promissory notes due January 1, 2025, and extended the additional 0.5 of interest through March 31, 2025. Amendment No. 8 was made effective as of June 30, 2024 and the lenders agreed that no event of default existed from such financial covenants as of such date. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the leverage ratio financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. However, as of such date we determined that we may need additional capital and/or relief from certain financial covenants in the future. Accordingly, on November 11, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 9 to the Credit Agreement, which provided the Company with revised financial covenants through June 30, 2026, permitted the Company to enter into the Rights Offering Term Sheet and Pre-Owned Floor Plan Facility and SLB Commitment Letter and permitted the Company to pay the convertible senior 6.75 promissory notes due January 1, 2025. The additional 0.5 of interest previously extended through March 31, 2025 will terminate on December 31, 2024. 
 The Company has established internal controls in place to monitor compliance with the financial covenants. In the event that the Company is unable to comply with the financial covenants in the future, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain an amendment or waiver of such financial covenants. The failure to meet financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, or to obtain an amendment or waiver, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may require additional financing or capital to pursue acquisitions or because of unforeseen circumstances. If financing or capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may not be able to develop and grow our business as anticipated and our business, operating results, and financial condition may be harmed. 
 We intend to continue making investments to support the development and growth of our business and to make strategic acquisitions. Although we currently intend to self-fund our growth initiatives, under certain circumstances we may determine that it is necessary or advisable to raise additional financing or capital. Additional financing or capital may not be available when we need it, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we decide to raise additional capital through issuances of equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. In 2023, our three largest stockholders backstopped our rights offering, and they recently agreed to provide 30.0 million in incremental capital commitments, which includes a 10.0 million backstopped rights offering. If we decide to raise additional debt, our existing stockholders may be subject to the risks associated with 
 31

higher leverage. In addition, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt. We utilize multiple vehicle floor plan facilities to finance a substantial amount of our new and pre-owned inventory. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, including under one or more of our vehicle floor plan facilities, or we are unable to obtain additional capital, including from any of our stockholders, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.
