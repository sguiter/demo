 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Unless otherwise required by the context, in this report, the words DISH DBS, DDBS, the Company, we, our and us refer to DISH DBS Corporation and its subsidiaries, DISH Network refers to DISH Network Corporation, our parent company, and its subsidiaries, including us, and EchoStar refers to EchoStar Corporation and its subsidiaries, our ultimate parent company. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, in particular, statements about our plans, objectives and strategies, growth opportunities in our industries and businesses, our expectations regarding future results, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, our estimates regarding the impact of regulatory developments and legal proceedings, and other trends and projections. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts and may be identified by words such as future, anticipate, intend, plan, goal, seek, believe, estimate, expect, predict, will, would, could, can, may, and similar terms. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and represent management s current views and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, events or results and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control. Accordingly, actual performance, events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those summarized below: SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to the DIRECTV Transaction We are subject to a number of risks while the DIRECTV Transaction is pending, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to the Integration Although we expect that the Merger will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized in the amounts anticipated, or may not be realized within the expected timeframe, or at all, and risks associated with the foregoing may also result from any extended delay in the Integration. 
 Competition and Economic Risks We face intense and increasing competition from providers of video, broadband and/or wireless services. Changing consumer behavior and new technologies in our Pay-TV business may reduce our subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us. Our pay-TV competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs and/or offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us. 
 If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, or at all, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy. 
 Operational and Service Delivery Risks Any deterioration in our operational performance, subscriber activations and churn rate and subscriber satisfaction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our Pay-TV subscribers and, if we fail to obtain or lose access to certain programming, our Pay-TV subscriber activations and our subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted.

Table of Contents 
 We have limited satellite capacity and any failures or reduced capacity, caused by, among other things, operational and environmental risks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather may result in risk of damage to our infrastructure and therefore our ability to provide services, and may lead to changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently depend on DISH Network to provide the vast majority of our satellite transponder capacity and other related services to us. Our business would be adversely affected if DISH Network ceases to provide these services to us and we are unable to obtain suitable replacement services from third parties. We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on independent third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a meaningful percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations. 
 Risks Related to our Human Capital We rely on highly skilled personnel for our business, and any inability to hire and retain key personnel or to hire qualified personnel may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business growth and customer retention strategies rely in part on the work of technically skilled employees. 
 Risks Related to our Products and Technology Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We are, and may become, party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property. If our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to correct such defects and our product and network service contracts could be delayed or cancelled, which could adversely affect our revenue. 
 Risks Related to Cybersecurity We have experienced and may experience in the future consistent cyber-attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems and any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations could disrupt or harm our business. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our services and products depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and other enabling systems. 
 Acquisition and Capital Structure Risks We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt and covenants in our Indentures could limit our ability to undertake certain types of activities and adversely affect our liquidity. 
 We may pursue acquisitions , dispositions, capital expenditures, the development, acquisition and launch of new satellites and other strategic initiatives to complement or expand our business , which may not be successful and we may lose a portion or all of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions. 
 Our ultimate parent, EchoStar, has made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets, and we have made and may continue to make funds available to EchoStar or, our parent, DISH Network in the form of cash distributions or loans in connection with the development of EchoStar s wireless business.

 Our Senior Secured Notes (defined herein) are subordinated to our existing unsecured notes and certain future unsecured notes with respect to certain realizations under the Intercompany Loan (defined herein) and any collateral pledged as security therefor. We may need additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund current obligations, to continue investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Our ultimate parent, EchoStar, is controlled by one principal stockholder, who is also our Chairman. 
 Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business Our services depend on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted. 
 Other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 10-K filed with the SEC, those discussed in Management s Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations herein and in the 10-K and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC.

 billion in wireless spectrum licenses. EchoStar s wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. EchoStar plans to commercialize its wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of the nation s first cloud-native, Open Radio Access Network O-RAN based 5G network (the 5G Network Deployment ). EchoStar currently expects capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest , for its 5G Network Deployment to be approximately billion, including amounts incurred in 2021, 2022, 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. EchoStar may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, continue its 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as EchoStar continues its 5G Network Deployment, EchoStar has and may continue to incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure, software and third-party integration. As a result of these investments, among other factors, EchoStar may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms. EchoStar may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required for its 5G Network Deployment and to compete effectively with other wireless service providers. In connection with the development of EchoStar s wireless business, including, without limitation, the efforts described above, we have made cash distributions and the intercompany loans to partially finance these efforts to date and may make additional cash distributions or loans to finance, in whole or in part, EchoStar s future efforts, including, among other things, any potential Northstar re-auction payment and SNR re-auction payment. There can be no assurance that EchoStar will be able to profitably deploy these wireless spectrum licenses. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies 5G Network Deployment in the Notes to EchoStar s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 for further information.

 in the AWS-3 Auction when they were allegedly under the de facto control of DISH Network and, therefore, were not entitled to the bidding credits as designated entities under applicable FCC rules. Vermont National participated in the AWS-3 Auction through its wholly-owned subsidiary, VTel Wireless . The complaint was unsealed after the United States Department of Justice notified the District Court that it had declined to intervene in the action. Vermont National seeks to recover on behalf of the United States government approximately billion, which reflects the billion in bidding credits that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless claimed in the AWS-3 Auction, trebled under the FCA. Vermont National also seeks civil penalties of not less than and not more than for each violation of the FCA. On March 2, 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a stay of the litigation until such time as the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC, et al. v. F.C.C. The D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 29, 2017 and remanded the matter to the FCC for further proceedings. Thereafter, the District Court maintained the stay until October 26, 2018. On February 11, 2019, the District Court granted Vermont National s unopposed motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On March 28, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss Vermont National s amended complaint, and on March 23, 2021, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss. On April 21, 2021, Vermont National filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and, on May 17, 2022, that court reversed the District Court s dismissal of the complaint . On June 16, 2022, the Defendants-Appellees filed a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc, but on August 17, 2022, that petition was denied. On August 25, 2023, the FCC provided a sworn declaration stating that the FCC considers SNR and Northstar to have fully and timely satisfied their obligations to pay money to the Government arising from the AWS-3 Auction. On that basis, on September 22, 2023, the Defendants filed a motion seeking partial summary judgment of no damages. On September 26, 2023, the Court denied the motion as premature. On March 8, 2024, the United States filed a motion to exercise its statutory prerogative to intervene in the case for the purpose of moving to dismiss it with prejudice, stating that the case is unlikely to vindicate the United States interests and would needlessly expend the Government s and this Court s resources. DISH Network intends to vigorously defend this case. DISH Network cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of this proceeding or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages. Other In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, among other things, disputes with programmers regarding fees. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, though the outcomes could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.

 million for satellite capacity leased from DISH Network, and telemetry, tracking and control TT C and other professional services provided to us by DISH Network. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred expenses of million and million, respectively, for satellite capacity leased from DISH Network, and telemetry, tracking and control TT C and other professional services provided to us by DISH Network. DISH Network is a supplier of the vast majority of our transponder capacity. These amounts are recorded in Cost of services on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The agreements pertaining to these expenses are discussed below. Satellite Capacity Leased from DISH Network . We lease satellite capacity on satellites owned or leased by DISH Network from a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network. See Satellites in Note 6 for further information. The term of each lease is set forth below: EchoStar X, XI, XIV and XVI. We lease all available capacity on the EchoStar X, XI, XIV and XVI satellites from a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network. The term of each satellite capacity agreement generally terminates upon the earlier of: (i) the end-of-life of the satellite; (ii) the date the satellite fails; or (iii) a certain date, which depends upon, among other things, the estimated useful life of the satellite. We generally have the option to renew each satellite capacity agreement on a year-to-year basis through the end of the respective satellite s life. . EchoStar XXIII.

Risk Factors. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Overview Recent Developments DIRECTV Transaction On September 29, 2024, EchoStar and DIRECTV Holdings, LLC DTV ), entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, DTV agreed to acquire from EchoStar all of its issued and outstanding equity interests of DISH DBS Corporation DISH DBS ), which operates its Pay-TV business (the Business and such acquisition of the Business the DIRECTV Transaction ).

 As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the DISH DBS intercompany receivables for the Intercompany Loan 2028 Tranche and other intercompany amounts totaled 4.606 billion, not including Permitted Transfer Cap receivables of up to 1.52 billion and certain other amounts of residual capital remaining based on performance. Upon the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, DISH DBS will become a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of DTV. Completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is subject to satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including, but not limited to, the receipt of governmental approvals and the success of the DISH DBS Exchange Offers, as detailed and defined in Note 7 i n the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The DISH DBS Exchange Offers expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on November 12, 2024, and the DISH DBS Exchange Offers have been terminated due to the failure to satisfy the Minimum Series Exchange Condition and the Acquisition Consent Threshold Condition, each as defined in the Exchange Offering Memorandum (as defined below). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, DIRECTV may terminate the Purchase Agreement by November 22, 2024 due to the failure to consummate the DISH DBS Exchange Offers by November 12, 2024 or the failure to satisfy the Acquisition Consent Threshold Condition. Asset Transfer Concurrently with the issuance of the 5 1/4 Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and the 5 3/4 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and using the proceeds thereof, we made two advances to DISH Network pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement dated November 26, 2021 (the Intercompany Loan to be used by DISH Network to finance the purchase of certain wireless spectrum licenses and for general corporate purposes, including the buildout of wireless infrastructure. The aggregate principal amount of the Intercompany Loan was initially 5.250 billion, and on February 11, 2022, we advanced an additional 1.5 billion to DISH Network. As of December 31, 2023, the receivable including capitalized paid in kind interest was 7.496 billion. On January 10, 2024, we, in our capacity as Lender under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement related to the Intercompany Loan between DISH Network and us, have consummated the assignment pursuant to such terms, without any modification or amendment thereto, of our receivable in respect to the first tranche which matures on December 1, 2026 2026 Tranche of 4.7 billion (the Intercompany Loan 2026 Tranche to DBS Intercompany Receivable L.L.C.

 Segments We currently operate one business segment, Pay-TV. Our Pay-TV business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value. We offer pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the SLING brand (collectively Pay-TV services). We promote our Pay-TV services by providing our subscribers with a better price-to-value relationship and experience than those available from other subscription television service providers. The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, FCC licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite DBS and Fixed Satellite Service FSS spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, broadcast operations, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations, and certain other assets utilized in our operations DISH TV ). We also design, develop and distribute receiver systems and provide digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/ downlinking, transmission and other services to third-party pay-TV providers. The SLING branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, multichannel, live-linear and on-demand streaming over-the-top OTT Internet-based domestic, international, Latino and Freestream video programming services SLING TV . We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative. Future Capital Requirements We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures, other investments, and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. Our capital expenditures vary depending on, among other things, the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining and there can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it will have a material adverse long-term effect on our cash flow. Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at favorable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position. We have made cash distributions and the intercompany loans to partially finance the development of EchoStar s 5G Network Deployment, including, but not limited to, the purchase of wireless spectrum licenses and the retail wireless business to date, and we may make additional funds available to EchoStar in the form of cash distributions or loans to finance, in whole or in part, EchoStar s future efforts. These factors, including, but not limited to, debt maturities, continuing investment in our business, financing acquisitions and other strategic transactions, may require us to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Economic Environment During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we experienced inflationary pressures in our commodity and labor costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the United States, which has significantly impacted our overall operating results.

Table of Contents 
 Operational Liquidity We make general investments in property such as, among others, satellites, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our Pay-TV business. Moreover, since we are a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurance that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment. There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is our churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers. To the extent we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our service margins. To the extent our Cost of services grow faster than our Service revenue, the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. Our Pay-TV service margins have been reduced by, among other things, higher programming costs. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers. Conversely, the slower we acquire subscribers, the more our operating cash flow is enhanced in that period. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by, among other things, the rate at which we make general investments, incur litigation expense, and any cash flow from financing activities. In addition, declines in our Pay-TV subscriber base and any decrease in subscriber-related margins negatively impact our cash flow, and there can be no assurance that our subscriber declines will not continue. Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty. While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Debt Issuances and Maturity Our 5 7/8 Senior Notes due 2024 with remaining balance of approximately 1.983 billion mature on November 15, 2024. We expect to fund this obligation from our current restricted cash and cash equivalents balances on hand. Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Long-Term Debt We are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures related to our long-term debt. In particular, t he indentures related to our outstanding senior notes and senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on our ability to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes, senior secured notes and our other long-term debt could become immediately payable. The senior notes and senior secured notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024.

OIBDA is defined as Operating income (loss) plus Depreciation and amortization. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled to Operating income (loss) in our discussion of Results of Operations below. DISH TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our DISH TV subscriber count. We also provide DISH TV services to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by 34.99, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count. SLING TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales and third-party marketing agreements in our SLING TV subscriber count. SLING TV subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects. SLING TV customers receiving SLING TV Freestream service, or service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our SLING TV subscriber count. For customers who subscribe to multiple SLING TV packages, each customer is only counted as one SLING TV subscriber.

 Pay-TV subscribers. Our Pay-TV subscriber count includes all DISH TV and SLING TV subscribers discussed above. For customers who subscribe to both our DISH TV services and our SLING TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber. Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber Pay-TV ARPU ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly Pay-TV Service revenue, for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. SLING TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as SLING TV subscribers increase as a percentage of total Pay-TV subscribers, it has had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU. DISH TV average monthly subscriber churn rate DISH TV churn rate ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate our DISH TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of DISH TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. DISH TV SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating traditional companies in the pay-TV industry. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH TV subscriber activation, or DISH TV SAC, and we believe presentations of pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. Our DISH TV SAC is calculated using all costs of acquiring DISH TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized equipment, advertising, installation, commissions and direct sales, etc.), which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses, plus capitalized payments made under certain sales incentive programs and the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers , divided by gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We include all new DISH TV subscribers in our calculation, including DISH TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. Pay-TV We offer Pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the SLING brand. As of September 30, 2024, we had 8.031 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 5.888 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.143 million SLING TV subscribers. We promote our Pay-TV services by providing our subscribers with better service, technology and value than those available from other subscription television service providers. We offer a wide selection of video services under the DISH TV brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the level of subscription. Our standard programming packages generally include programming provided by national cable networks. We also offer programming packages that include local broadcast networks, specialty sports channels, premium movie channels and Latino and international programming. We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative. Our SLING TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including, among others, streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and phones. We offer SLING domestic, SLING International, SLING Latino and SLING Freestream video programming services.

 Trends Competition Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. We and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and broadband service providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and other streaming and mobile devices, including wireless service providers. In recent years, industry consolidation and convergence has created competitors with greater scale and multiple product/service offerings. These developments, among others, have contributed to intense and increasing competition, and we expect such competition to continue. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, generally as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper receivers, and by providing retention credits. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. Many of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including, but not limited to, bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers. Certain competitors have been able to subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services. Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from programmers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunications companies that are rapidly increasing their Internet-based video offerings and direct-to-consumer exclusive and non-exclusive content. We also face competition from providers of video content , many of which are providers of programming content to us, that distribute content over the Internet including services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content. These product offerings include, but are not limited to, Netflix, Hulu, Apple+, Prime Video, YouTube TV, Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+ , Max, STARZ, Peacock, Fubo, Philo and Tubi and certain bundles of these offerings. Significant changes in consumer behavior regarding the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband or Internet- connected device they choose. Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our DISH TV services cord cutting ), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages cord shaving or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us. Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies, programming providers and others may result in, among other things, greater scale and financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and/or wireless services in competition with our services and may exacerbate the risks described under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in our public filings. These transactions may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to certain programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all.

Table of Contents 
 Our Pay-TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. As our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Programming Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices. Programming costs represent a large percentage of our Cost of services and the largest component of our total expense. We expect these costs to continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. In particular, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our subscribers. Our ability to provide services under these agreements and negotiate acceptable terms depends on, among other things, the number of subscribers we have, our actual, perceived or anticipated financial condition and our negotiating power against each programmer, which can vary depending on the size and scale of such programmer. Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers. Increases in programming costs have caused us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our services or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our services. Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us. Furthermore, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts. In the past, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. There can be no assurance that the removal of any channels will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses.

 Other Developments Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Patents Through our subsidiaries, we hold dozens of issued United States and foreign patents that relate to Adaptive Bitrate Streaming. On September 9, 2022, the chief administrative law judge at the United States International Trade Commission ITC issued an Initial Determination holding that the video streaming in certain Peloton, NordicTrack and Mirror exercise equipment infringes four of those patents, and recommended that the ITC prevent the importation of the infringing products. On March 8, 2023, the ITC issued its Final Determination, which affirmed the Initial Determination for three of the four patents in all material aspects, and issued the recommended exclusion and cease and desist orders, which will become effective after a Presidential review period. On February 9, 2023, we entered into a confidential license agreement covering Mirror exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. On May 1, 2023, we entered into a 75 million license agreement covering Peloton exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded the 75 million license agreement in Equipment sales and other revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). On March 6, 2024, we entered into a license agreement covering NordicTrack exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products and received the initial payment.

 Pay-TV Subscribers DISH TV subscribers. We lost approximately 188,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 181,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. This increase in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, partially offset by a lower DISH TV churn rate. SLING TV subscribers. We added approximately 145,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the addition of approximately 117,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. The change in net SLING TV subscribers was primarily related to higher SLING TV subscriber activations and lower SLING TV subscriber disconnects in 2024 due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers . We continue to experience increased competition, including competition from other subscription video on-demand and live-linear OTT service providers, many of which are providers of our content and offer football and other seasonal sports programming direct to subscribers on an a la carte basis. DISH TV subscribers, gross. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we activated approximately 75,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 142,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 47.2 . This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand, shifting consumer behavior and lower marketing expenditures, as well as increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers. Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. DISH TV churn rate. Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.47 compared to 1.58 for the same period in 2023. Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. O ur DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, cord cutting, shifting consumer behavior and increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new DISH TV subscriber activations as well as DISH TV subscriber churn rate. Our future gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and our DISH TV subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue.

 Service revenue. Service revenue totaled 2.590 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 171 million or 6.2 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Service revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below. Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was 108.88 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 105.25 during the same period in 2023. The 3.63 or 3.4 increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV and SLING TV programming price increases and higher Pay-TV ad sales revenue. The DISH TV and SLING TV programming package price increases were effective in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of services. Cost of services totaled 1.675 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 74 million or 4.3 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Cost of services was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber. Programming costs per subscriber increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Cost of services represented 64.7 and 63.4 of Service revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our Cost of services have and will continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 274 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , an 82 million or 23.1 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from lower marketing expenditures and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in personnel costs . DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was 985 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,065 during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 80 or 7.5 . This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising costs per subscriber and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts, partially offset by higher commission costs due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled 6 million and 16 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts. To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the DISH TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Our DISH TV SAC may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies.

 Interest income. Interest income totaled 79 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 33 million compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily related to the reduction in interest income associated with our Intercompany Loan to DISH Network. On January 10, 2024, 4.7 billion of this receivable was transferred to EchoStar, our ultimate parent. This change was partially offset by the increase in interest income associated with the additional intercompany loans to DISH Network. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax provision was 113 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 122 million during the same period in 2023. This change was primarily related to a decrease in Income (loss) before income taxes, partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate.

 Pay-TV Subscribers DISH TV subscribers. We lost approximately 583,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 696,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. This decrease in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from a lower DISH TV churn rate, partially offset by lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. SLING TV subscribers. We added approximately 88,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 214,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. The change in net SLING TV subscribers was primarily related to lower SLING TV subscriber disconnects in 2024 due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, partially offset by lower SLING TV subscriber activations. We continue to experience increased competition, including competition from other subscription video on-demand and live-linear OTT service providers, many of which are providers of our content and offer football and other seasonal sports programming direct to subscribers on an a la carte basis. DISH TV subscribers, gross. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we activated approximately 230,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 375,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 38.7 . This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand, shifting consumer behavior and lower marketing expenditures, as well as increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers. Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. DISH TV churn rate. Our DISH TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.46 compared to 1.69 for the same period in 2023. Our DISH TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. O ur DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, cord cutting, shifting consumer behavior and increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. In addition, our DISH TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was briefly elevated due to the cyber-security incident in the first quarter of 2023. Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. Service revenue. Service revenue totaled 7.923 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 619 million or 7.2 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Service revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below. Equipment sales and other revenue. Equipment sales and other revenue totaled 45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 94 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Equipment sales and other revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to a non-recurring 75 million license of our Adaptive Bitrate Streaming patents to Peloton covering certain Peloton products that resolves our litigation involving those products during the second quarter of 2023 .

Table of Contents 
 Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was 108.21 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 103.98 during the same period in 2023. The 4.23 or 4.1 increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV and SLING TV programming price increases and higher Pay-TV ad sales revenue. The DISH TV and SLING TV programming package price increases were effective in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of services. Cost of services totaled 5.049 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 339 million or 6.3 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Cost of services was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base and lower variable and retention costs per subscriber, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber. Programming costs per subscriber increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Variable and retention costs per subscriber during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by approximately 30 million in cyber-security-related expenses to remediate the incident and provide additional customer support. Cost of services represented 63.7 and 63.1 of Service revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 821 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a 251 million or 23.4 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from lower marketing expenditures and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in personnel costs . Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 214 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 22 million or 9.3 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH TV subscribers. DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was 993 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,095 during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 102 or 9.3 . This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising costs per subscriber and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts, partially offset by higher commission costs due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled 19 million and 43 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts. Interest income. Interest income totaled 211 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 134 million compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily related to the reduction in interest income associated with our Intercompany Loan to DISH Network. On January 10, 2024, 4.7 billion of this receivable was transferred to EchoStar, our ultimate parent. This change was partially offset by the increase in interest income associated with the additional intercompany loans to DISH Network. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Other, net. Other, net expense totaled 68 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 68 million compared to the same period in 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by a 70 million loss in equity in earnings from our Invidi investment, including 63 million from our portion of Invidi s goodwill impairment.

 Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax provision was 366 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 416 million during the same period in 2023. This change was primarily related to a decrease in Income (loss) before income taxes, partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate. Non-GAAP Performance Measures and Reconciliation It is management s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of our GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it is a helpful measure for those evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 OIBDA OIBDA, which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability of our business on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. OIBDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to operating income (loss).

The guarantee of a Guarantor will be deemed automatically discharged and released in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture: (i) in connection with any direct or indirect sale, conveyance or other disposition of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation), if such sale or disposition is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the indenture; (ii) if such Guarantor is dissolved or liquidated in accordance with the provisions of the indenture; (iii) if we designate any such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the indenture; or (iv) with respect to a Guarantor which constitutes a Non-Core Asset (as such term is defined in the applicable indenture), upon the sale or other disposition of certain equity interests of such Guarantor, if such sale or disposition is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the indenture. There are no restrictions on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other distributions of funds from the Guarantors, except those imposed by applicable law. The rights of holders of the registered senior notes against the Guarantors may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Under certain circumstances (including a finding that a Guarantor was insolvent at the time its guarantee of the registered senior notes was issued), a court could hold that the obligations of a Guarantor under a guarantee may be voided or are subordinate to other obligations of the Guarantor. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the Guarantor s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer under U.S. federal or state law.

 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Risks Relating to the DIRECTV Transaction Termination of the Purchase Agreement or failure to otherwise complete the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Termination of the Purchase Agreement or any failure to otherwise complete the DIRECTV Transaction may result in various adverse consequences, including: our not being able to realize the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction ; our business being materially adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the DIRECTV Transaction, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the DIRECTV Transaction; and negative reactions from the financial markets, respective customers and other stakeholders possibly related to the above. If any of the foregoing consequences were to occur as a result of termination of the Purchase Agreement, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The timing of the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is not certain, and is subject to certain conditions, some of which we cannot control, which could result in the DIRECTV Transaction not being completed or being completed later than we expect, which could have a material adverse impact on our costs and revenues or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including, for example, the satisfaction of certain antitrust and other regulatory approvals and the successful exchange of DISH DBS Notes, none of which have been satisfied, and the absence of legal restraints prohibiting the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. Governmental agencies may not approve the DIRECTV Transaction or may impose conditions to any such approval or require changes to the terms of the DIRECTV Transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, imposing costs on or limiting our revenues or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction. Furthermore, under the Purchase Agreement, each party s obligation to consummate the DIRECTV Transaction is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the performance in all material respects of the other party s covenants under the Purchase Agreement, including, with respect to us, certain covenants regarding the operation of our business prior to completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. As a result of these conditions, we cannot provide assurance that the DIRECTV Transaction will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. If such conditions are not fulfilled by the Outside Date or, if for any other reason, the DIRECTV Transaction is not completed on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), the Purchase Agreement may be terminated and the DIRECTV Transaction may not be completed.

Table of Contents 
 There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required governmental and regulatory approvals to complete the DIRECTV Transaction, which, if delayed or not granted, is likely to delay or jeopardize the DIRECTV Transaction . The DIRECTV Transaction is conditioned on the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission FCC and possibly the consent of certain other merger control authorities and other governmental entities as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (collectively, Regulatory Approval ). These governmental and regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, those agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business. The required approvals may not be obtained or the required conditions to the DIRECTV Transaction may not be satisfied, or, even if the required approvals are obtained and the conditions to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction are satisfied, the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals are uncertain. Any delay in completing the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DIRECTV Transaction is conditioned on the consummation of a pre-closing reorganization, which requires the completion of transfers of certain assets and liabilities between us and certain of our affiliates, which transfers may require consents from or approval of third parties. The Purchase Agreement is conditioned, among other things, upon the consummation of a pre-closing reorganization, which requires, among other things, that certain contracts and other assets, rights and liabilities are to be transferred between DISH DBS and certain of its affiliates in connection with the DIRECTV Transaction, as further described in the Purchase Agreement. The transfer of certain of these contracts and other assets, rights and liabilities may require consents or approvals of third parties or provide other rights to third parties. Some parties may use consent requirements or other rights to terminate contracts or obtain more favorable contractual terms from us, which, for example, could take the form of price increases for services or assets that we require, forcing us and/or our affiliates to either expend additional resources in order to obtain the services or assets previously provided under the contracts or to make arrangements with new third parties. If we do not obtain required consents or approvals, the DIRECTV Transaction may not be completed, or, if completed, we may not be reflective of the currently intended DIRECTV Transaction and we may be required to seek alternative arrangements, which may not come on a timely basis or at all, or be more costly and/or of lower quality. The termination, modification, replacement or replication of these contracts or permits or the failure to timely complete the transfer or assignment of these contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on the prospects for completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. We have and continue to incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the DIRECTV Transaction. If the DIRECTV Transaction does not occur, we will not benefit from these transaction related costs. We have incurred and will continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction and the satisfaction of the related closing conditions, which could be substantial. Nonrecurring transaction costs may include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial, consulting, investment banking and accounting advisors and costs incurred in connection with obtaining required consents or approvals from governmental authorities or contract counterparties. Such costs may be material and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the DIRECTV Transaction does not occur in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to derive any benefit from such costs.

 The announcement and pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The announcement and pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with respective existing and future customers, suppliers, vendors and employees, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose customers, suppliers or vendors, and new contracts with any of these third parties could be delayed, increased or decreased, and we may lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the DIRECTV Transaction. Additionally, uncertainty about the completion and effect of the DIRECTV Transaction on our business, financial condition and results of operations may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles within each company after the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. If such employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty relating to the DIRECTV Transaction or a desire not to continue to be employees of ours or DTV after the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have expended, and continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the DIRECTV Transaction, which are being diverted from our day-to-day operations and future growth plans. In addition, the failure to complete the DIRECTV Transaction may result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationship with employees, customers and other partners in the business community. The Purchase Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction . The Purchase Agreement subjects us and our subsidiaries to restrictions on our business activities prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. The Purchase Agreement obligates us generally to, among other things, operate our Pay-TV business in the ordinary course until the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction and to use our commercially reasonable efforts to preserve a substantially intact business organizations, operations and goodwill of the business and maintain in all material respects commercial relationships. These restrictions on our business activities may adversely affect our ability to execute certain business strategies outside of the ordinary course of business, including paying dividends or making distributions, pursuing attractive business opportunities, making certain investments or acquisitions, hiring or terminating certain employees, selling, leasing, or licensing material real property, settling litigation matters, entering into certain material contracts, selling assets, engaging in capital expenditures, incurring indebtedness or making changes to its business. Such limitations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. The risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. For additional information, see the complete set of terms and conditions of the DIRECTV Transaction included in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also obligates us to, among other things, incur certain costs, make substantial investments in the Pay-TV business and take other actions, that absent the Purchase Agreement, we may or may not have taken. Absent certain exemptions in the Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to take such actions regardless if the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. These actions may be different than the historical manner in which we ran the business.

 As a holding company, we are dependent on the operations and funds of our subsidiaries. We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including to service any of our debt obligations. On September 30, 2024, we announced a sale of our Pay-TV business, from which we derive a substantial portion of our cash flow. With the sale of that business, and the interim operating covenants that restrict our access to that cash, we will be required to, among other things, sell our Pay-TV business and transfer at least 400 million of cash (subject to certain upward adjustments) to DTV upon closing of the DIRECTV Transaction and we are prevented from declaring any dividend or otherwise permitting any leakage in excess of 1.520 billion (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including transaction expenses and certain accrued interest adjustments and adjustments tied to certain key performance indicators) between the signing and closing of the DIRECTV Transaction. As a result, our ability to fund our Wireless business will be limited to by our cash flow from operations and ability to generate capital from our other businesses.
