SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995, about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical
facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition,
business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can
identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, 
 continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, 
 potential, predict, project, should, target, toward, 
 will, or would, or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. These forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 

our
 expectations regarding our revenue, expenses, profitability and other operating results; 

the
 growth rates of the markets in which we compete; 

the
 costs and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, as well as our ability to promote our brand; 

our
 ability to provide quality products that are acceptable to our customers; 

our
 reliance on key personnel and our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel; 

our
 ability to effectively manage our growth, including offering new product categories and any international expansion; 

our
 ability to maintain the security and availability of our software; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property rights and avoid disputes in connection with the use of intellectual property rights
 of others; 

our
 ability to protect our users information and comply with growing and evolving data privacy laws and regulations; 

future
 investments in our business, our anticipated capital expenditures, and our estimates regarding our capital requirements; 

our
 ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants; and 

our
 success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing. 

We
caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

ii 

You
should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe
may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking
statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive environment. New
risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have
an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected
in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially
from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe such information
provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to
indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain,
and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. 

The
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are
made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events
or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information, actual results, revised expectations
or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. 

In
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to Perfect Moment, we, us, our, 
and the Company refer to Perfect Moment Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

operations of during the period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of . 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s consolidated financial
statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty. 

Management s
plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include: 

Taking
 out short-term loans, purchase order financing and debt factoring to assist with working capital shortfalls 

Exploring
 sources of long-term funding in the private markets and additional equity financing 

Closely
 monitoring the collection of debts 

Strategies
 and plans in place to deliver improved margins in the next financial year 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date of these unaudited condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements were available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and to obtain additional capital financing. No assurance can be given that the Company
will be successful in these efforts mentioned above.

Revenue
is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company s customers.
Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product.
This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. For direct-to-consumer
ecommerce revenue, the Company receives payment before the customer receives the promised goods. Revenue is only recognized once the
goods have been delivered to the customer. Sales to wholesale customers are recognized when the customer has control which will depend
on the agreed upon International Commercial Terms. For inventories sold on consignment to wholesalers, the Company records revenue when
the inventory is sold to the third-party customer by the wholesaler. The Company may issue merchant credits, which are essentially refund
credits. The merchant credits are initially deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue when tendered for payment.

 reporting date. 

Level
 3:

 inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data. 

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying values of capital lease obligations
and debt obligations approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing
market interest rates. Unless otherwise noted, it is management s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest
or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.

if paid between 31 and 45 days of funding; or for 
if paid within 46 to 60 days of funding. These advances are secured by the Company s tangible and intangible assets. As a

ITEM
2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

(Amounts in this Item 2 are presented in thousands,
except (i) share and per share data and (ii) percentages) 

Perfect
Moment is a high-performance, luxury skiwear and lifestyle brand that fuses technical excellence with fashion-led designs. We create
apparel and products that feature what we believe is an unmatched combination of fashion, form, function and fun for women, men and children. 

Across
all revenue channels, Perfect Moment distributes to over sixty countries. We design our products in-house and work with a variety of
suppliers to manufacture materials and finished goods. Our collections are worn by an evolving list of celebrities and influencers
whose perfect moments are captured across a range of social media platforms. 

Revenue 

Since
fiscal year 2020, the company s fiscal second quarter revenue averaged approximately 12 of the fiscal year s total revenue,
with the fiscal first half averaging only 15 of total annual revenue. 

Total
revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,808 compared to 6,876 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 2,068 or 30 . The decrease is primarily attributed to a collaboration with Hugo Boss in FY24 totaling 2,024 that ended
in FY24. The remaining decrease
of 44 is attributed to the timing of wholesale shipments of 98 offset by an increase in ecommerce of 54. 

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,833 compared to 5,888 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a
decrease of 2,054 or 35 . The decrease is primarily attributed to a collaboration with Hugo Boss that ended in FY24.
The remaining decrease of 30 is attributed to timing of wholesale shipments of 120 or 4 offset by an increase in ecommerce of 90
or 8 attributed to enhanced brand awareness and the company s focus on ecommerce. 

The Company did not look to extend the two-year collaboration
with Hugo Boss as the collaboration required the use of Perfect Moments supply chain, designers, and took precedence
over all other wholesalers. The change allows management to continue building the foundations of future growth through better delivery
times, improved quality, consistency, and extend our supplier relationships which will better serve our wholesale partners and direct
to consumer channels, driving longer terms sustainable revenue growth. 

Ecommerce

The
Company has deployed strategies across the entire sales and marketing funnel as we focus on building a direct relationship with our customer,
which we believe is an important step of following our customer from the ski slopes, to apr s, to the chalet, and eventually home
expanding our product offering across all seasons. 

We
remain one of the most followed luxury ski brands globally and increased our followers across all social media platforms (Instagram,
Facebook (Meta) and TikTok) increased by 1.6 from March 31, 2024 through September 30, 2024 and increased 19.2 compared to September
30, 2023. The number of unpaid celebrities and influencers driving the top of our funnel is extraordinary for a Company our size. The
strength at the top of the funnel provides opportunities to move our customers through the funnel that not only leads to sales, but more
importantly allows us to build a community and ultimately customer loyalty. 

Gross revenue for the six months
ended September 30, 2024, increased to 3,398 an increase of 795 or 31 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, driven by
continued growth in ecommerce revenue. The end of season sale for autumn/winter 2023 (AW23) included an unusually high percentage of product
sold at a discount, making way for a significant new collection replacing many of our product lines for autumn/winter 2024 (AW24), in
part due to an upcoming change in legislation in some of our markets for the use of Durable Water Repellency treatments. The Company experiences
higher return rates on discounted products and for the six months ended September 30, 2024, our returns as a percentage of sales increased
to 39 from 28 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Overall, net revenue increased 54k or 3 . 

21 

Gross
Profit and Margin 

Our
gross profit for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,430 compared to 3,761 for the six months ended September 30, 2023,
a decrease of 1,331 or 35 . The decrease is driven by lower sales that is primarily attributed to a two-year collaboration with
Hugo Boss that ended in FY24. Our gross margins were 51 compared to 55 in the prior year. Improving our gross
margins remains an important focus, and we anticipate our gross margins in our current fiscal year 2025 to significantly improve
year-over-year. We are making significant progress across all our margin expansion projects including opening our first U.S.
distribution center last month. Following the facility opening in October 2024, we realized an immediate improvement in operating efficiency. We will experience reduced duty costs for ecommerce orders in the second half of this
fiscal year, which will drive improved gross margins compared to last year. The decrease in gross margin for the six months ended
September 30, 2024 versus the six months ended September 30, 2023 is attributed to the end of season sale for autumn/winter 2023
(AW23) that included an unusually high percentage of product sold at a discount, making way for a significant new collection
replacing many of our product lines for autumn/winter 2024 (AW24), in part due to an upcoming change in legislation in some of our
markets for the use of Durable Water Repellency treatments. We also had a greater percentage of ecommerce sales versus wholesale
sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. Ecommerce margins are historically lower than
wholesale. 

Our
gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,071 compared to 3,279 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 1,208 or 37 . The decrease is driven by lower sales that is primarily attributed to a collaboration with Hugo
Boss that ended in FY24. Our gross margins were 54.0 compared to 56 achieved in the prior year. The decrease
in gross margin is attributed to the continuation of the end of season sale noted above plus a greater percentage of ecommerce sales
versus wholesale sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. Ecommerce margins are
historically lower than wholesale. 

Third-Party Distribution Center
Update 

Historically, all ecommerce orders were dispatched from a third-party distribution center
in the United Kingdom and in most instances the Company is paying duties to cross international borders. Compounding the margin dilution
is the fact we were paying duties at full retail and not at a transfer price. 

On July 15, 2024 we executed an agreement with Quiet
Platforms to be our third party operated distribution center in the United States. The U.S. distribution center will improve our customer
experience, lower our duty cost plus reduce outbound and return shipping cost in the U.S. market, which represented over 40 of our revenue
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. In fiscal year 2025 our ecommerce revenue will flow through the U.S. distribution center with
Wholesale revenue running through the U.S. distribution center in fiscal year 2026. We are reviewing our European distribution strategy
to improve margins in the fiscal year 2026, which represented over 30 of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 

The
Company has reclassified certain costs totaling 614 and 991 previously classified as cost of sales for the three and six months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively, to SG A expenses to conform to the current year presentation. For fiscal year ended March 31, 2024
and March 31, 2023, had we reclassified 3.2 million and 2.7 million, respectively, of costs of revenue to SG A, the our adjusted
gross margin would have been 50.9 and 48.7 . 

22 

Summary
of Key Strategies to Improve Margin 

Shift
 towards direct-to-consumer revenue (such as ecommerce and physical retail) . We expect that rebalancing our sales from wholesale
 to direct to consumer, coupled with the other margin initiatives would result in a double-digit percentage point improvement in our
 gross margin, due to channel mix, over time. 

Reducing
 product range within skiwear . We believe the current range offers too much choice, and yields poorer margins, resulting from
 a lack of economies of scale and higher levels of markdown and discounts. 

Review
 and modify supplier base . We are expecting our supplier base to evolve as we source fabrics and trims more efficiently and introduce
 new finished good suppliers with better commercial terms (such as lower labor costs or better duty rates due to factories being based
 in the EU, UK or Vietnam). 

Review
 and revise price positioning . We will continue reviewing our selling prices. We are expecting to introduce better discipline
 and processes to assess price positioning with a focus on margin by each product, country of manufacture and country of selling.
 We expect to raise selling prices to improve the gross margin over time as part of the range development process and will monitor
 price elasticity. We believe prices are relatively in-elastic for our industry and our customer segment, and that pricing increases
 are generally expected by customers annually for luxury goods. 

Focusing
 on reducing costs relating to crossing borders . Operating a global business requires crossing borders with products resulting
 in high costs for freight, duty, couriers and other handling costs. Perfect Moment has grown very quickly and as a result has not
 been able to focus on crossing borders in a cost-effective way. We are focused on reducing these costs and expect to see savings
 over time in freight (for example by using less air freight and more sea freight), lowering duty costs (for example moving production
 to countries with lower tariffs and opening third party logistic hubs) and reducing broker fees through better processes. 

Our
Business Strategy 

Perfect
Moment sits at the intersection of three large and growing markets (luxury ski apparel, premium outerwear and athleisure and lifestyle).
Based on the characteristics of these respective markets, we believe we have the right brand profile, geographic footprint, target demographic,
marketing tools and operational expansion plan to gain significant market share. We believe we are also well-positioned to drive sustainable
growth and profitability by executing on the following strategies: 

23 

Grow
Brand Awareness and Attract New Customers 

Building
brand awareness among potential new customers and strengthening our connections with those who already know us will be a key driver of
our growth. While we believe our brand has achieved substantial traction globally and those who have experienced our products demonstrate
loyalty, our presence is relatively nascent in many of our markets. We believe we have a significant opportunity to increase brand awareness
and attract new customers to Perfect Moment through word of mouth, brand marketing and performance marketing. 

In
the past, Perfect Moment s strong skiing heritage has been used to engage with a core ski audience for whom we believe the combination
of technical performance and retro inspired designs resonate strongly. We believe the nature of skiing as a largely affluent, international
pursuit means there is a large opportunity in aspirational, lifestyle-led social media engagement. We believe Perfect Moment has captured
this social media opportunity to great effect, combining the style and form of the brand with celebrities, influencers, top-tier editorial,
collaborations and luxury locations to create a distinct, fun and engaging aspirational lifestyle narrative. Beyond social media, we
believe Perfect Moment has been able to deploy this same core brand proposition and narrative to direct digital marketing and traditional
media, elevating brand profile and driving high levels of engagement simultaneously. Perfect Moment has also been able to build an effective
online marketing engine driving large volumes of direct, organic search and paid search traffic to our ecommerce website, www.perfectmoment.com 

Perfect
Moment expects to continue its approach to social media, building its follower base through a similar and evolving mix of celebrities,
influencers, editorials and locations. It also expects to continue to pursue and scale the effective search engine optimization and paid
search strategies which have contributed to online sales growth, as well as direct marketing and customer engagement via direct customer
communications. Perfect Moment is developing plans to leverage a new Perfect Moment owned physical store network to deepen its brand
identity and profile, as well as drive higher levels of loyalty and engagement at the local level. On August 1, 2024 the Company executed
a six-month lease for our first seasonal store in SOHO, New York for AW24 and on October 25, 2024 the Company commenced a three-month lease for our second seasonal store in Bicester, England. 

Brand
marketing and performance marketing also work together to drive millions of visits to our digital platforms. Brand marketing includes
differentiated content, our network of ambassadors, and social media, all of which result in what we believe is outsized engagement with
our community. Our performance marketing efforts are designed to drive customers from awareness to consideration to conversion. These
efforts include retargeting, paid search and product listing advertisements, paid social media advertisements, search engine optimization
and personalized email. We believe our highly productive, diversified strategy generates a significant return on brand equity, driving
sales and building a growing customer database. 

We
approach this strategy as a funnel, with brand awareness at the top and customer conversion at the bottom, allocating resources across
the top, middle and bottom, and measuring returns on these respective investments. 

Accelerate
Digital Growth 

Having
used the wholesale channel to establish our brand globally, we believe we will become less reliant on wholesale partners during the next
five years by committing more resources to our direct-to-consumer strategy and accelerating our digital growth. We believe technology and
partnerships are the key underpinning factors in any e-commerce business and as such we will continue to enhance customer experience,
focusing on mobile as the dominant growth channel and leveraging the emerging benefits of social and conversational commerce. 

Pursue
International Expansion and Enter New Markets 

We
believe there is an opportunity to increase penetration across our existing markets and selectively enter new regions. Although the Perfect
Moment brand is recognized globally, our past investments have been focused on North America, the United Kingdom and the EU and have
driven revenue growth in the United States during the past fiscal year. 

While
we expect the majority of our near-term growth to continue to come from the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU, we believe
there is a tremendous opportunity over the long term throughout the rest of the world. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we increased
our outreach in what we believe are the most promising countries in continental Europe. As part of the plan to enter new markets, we
will start with China, as we seek to enhance our ability to serve our international customers and further establish Perfect Moment as
a global brand. 

24 

We
believe there is a significant opportunity beyond our existing markets, with China representing the next market opening for Perfect Moment.
China is projected to become the largest winter sports market, with people participating expected to reach 50 million by 2025 with one thousand
ski resorts to be open by 2030, according to reports by Daxue Consulting and Capital Mind. We allocated a small amount of inventory to
test the Chinese market directly in November 2024 on Tmall, using local partners to operate, with a digital approach to selling. We were
originally forecasting to run losses with respect to such activities for two years, then become profitable from the third year of such
activities, with China representing less than 10 of our revenue by 2027. The data we now have on this small test has led to exploring
partnership models such as a Joint Venture, where we could benefit for local distribution, market expertise and financial support for
inventory and marketing. We still believe the most significant hurdle to overcome with respect to our plan to enter the Chinese market
is liquidity to fund the initial operating losses. 

In
order to offer a more localized experience to customers internationally, we intend to offer market-specific languages, currency and content,
as well as strategic international shipping and distribution hubs. We plan to leverage our social media strategy and expand our network
of social media ambassadors to grow our brand awareness globally. 

Enhance
Our Wholesale Network 

Although
in the next five years we will be mainly focused on accelerating digital growth and our direct-to-consumer channel, we still intend to continue
broadening customer access and strengthening our global foothold in new and existing markets by strategically expanding our wholesale
network and deepening current relationships. In all of our markets, we have an opportunity to increase sales by adding new wholesale
partners and increasing volume in existing retailers. Additionally, we are focused on strengthening relationships with our retail partners
through broader offerings, exclusive products and shop-in-shop formats, which are dedicated spaces within another company s retail
store on a short-term rental basis. We believe our retail partners have a strong incentive to showcase our brand as our products drive
customer traffic and consistent full-price sell-through in their stores. 

Broaden
Our Product Offering 

Continuing
to enhance and expand our product offering represents a meaningful growth driver for Perfect Moment. We expect that broadening our product
line will allow us to strengthen brand loyalty with the existing Perfect Moment customer base, drive higher penetration in our existing
markets and expand our appeal across new geographies. We intend to continue developing our offering through the following strategies. 

Elevate
Fall and Winter . Perfect Moment will continue to focus on quality materials and distinctive designs to create luxury products which
aim to deliver technical performance and style impact. However, believing that people want to bring the functionality of our ski apparel
into their everyday lives, Perfect Moment is broadening the product range beyond the core on-slope skiwear to encompass
less technical lifestyle products and a wide range of exceptional products for any occasion, including all year-round accessories. 

Expand
Spring and Summer. We intend to continue building our successful Spring and Summer collections in categories such as activewear,
loungewear and swimwear. We believe offering inspiring new and complementary product categories that are consistent with our values of
heritage, functionality and quality and can become part of our core business represents an opportunity to develop a closer relationship
with our customers and expand our addressable market. In June 2024, we launched an Ibiza-inspired Summer Capsule Collection across our
global eCommerce channels. The collection was highlighted in a photoshoot published in British Vogue featuring photographer, Grace Burns,
and models Stella Jones and Paloma Baygual wearing items from the collection. 

We
believe this strategy will deliver a number of benefits: 

Increased
 Revenues . We expect that cross-over into adjacent product markets will increase sales by allowing us to sell outerwear, lifestyle
 products, activewear and swimwear to non-skiers and cross-sell lifestyle and off-slope products to existing skiwear
 customers in a winter setting. 

Reduced
 Seasonality . We expect that sales of new lifestyle products as well as activewear and swimwear products will be less concentrated
 in the winter months and increase revenue from new and existing customers as we grow brand awareness. 

Improved
 Margins . We believe that our margins will be improved by this strategy because modest price increases across the existing range
 will allow Perfect Moment to strengthen its gross margins, greater use of high-margin luxury materials such as cashmere will support
 price and margin increases and a move towards more less technically-complex lifestyle pieces will also drive margin improvement.
 Full price sales with limited promotional activity will further improve margins. 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and the six months ended September 30, 2024, we restructured and invested in our design,
product development, merchandizing and production teams to create a pathway to execute this underpinning strategy. We launched our
first spring / summer capsule encapsulating our new strategy at the end of Q1 FY25. We plan to then gradually increase our product
offering as we evaluate demand, supply and profitability. A s
of this filing, we are ready to sell into the AW25 Wholesale Market which opens in December and closes in February for shipments in
FY26. We have
bolstered the team that includes hiring a Chief Merchant. The Chief Merchant is revising the calendar for 2026 (FY27) to increase
the number of product drops, further capitalizing on opportunities to increase revenue and margin. 

25 

Establish
Perfect Moment Owned Physical Retail 

Perfect
Moment has grown to date without a Perfect Moment owned physical stand-alone store presence. Sales growth has been driven by our wholesale
network and online offering. As part of our growth strategy, we believe opening directly operated stores in strategically selected major
cities and pop-up stores in strategic ski resorts and high-traffic city locations would provide an excellent opportunity to generate
sales in key locations, providing a luxury in-store experience, reflecting the character of the brand and providing an experiential contact
point for customers. 

As
our product range expands, we see the potential to further grow our community with a physical presence by opening directly operated stores.
We already have a physical presence in department stores, operated under wholesale arrangements. Operating Perfect Moment owned stores
would provide our community a home for the brand and act as a beacon for new or potential customers, but they also add extra complexity
and risk. In order to test our retail model, we plan to first establish seasonal store locations. We evaluate each potential store location based
on lease availability and projected viability, and plan to open popups in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 and year-round stores
beginning the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027. On August 1, 2024 the Company executed a six-month lease for our first pop-up in SOHO,
New York for AW24 and on October 25, 2024 the Company commenced a three-month lease for our second seasonal store in Bicester, England. 

Segment
Reporting 

The
Company applies ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, in determining reportable segments for its financial statement disclosure. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The Company reports segments based on the financial information
it uses in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Management has determined that the Company operates in one business
segment, product sales. Key financial measures including but not limited to gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and net loss are not reported
at a disaggregated level for wholesale and ecommerce and resource allocation decisions to the business strategy are not made based solely
on our key financial measures. 

Geographic
Concentration 

Although
we are organized fundamentally as one business segment, our revenue is primarily split between three geographic areas: the United States,
Europe and the United Kingdom. Customers in these regions are served by our leadership and operations teams in the United Kingdom and
our production team in Hong Kong.

The
decrease in United States revenue as a percentage of total revenue is primarily attributed to a collaboration with Hugo Boss in FY24
totaling 2,024 that ended in FY24. 

The Company
did not look to extend the two-year collaboration with Hugo Boss as the collaboration required the use of Perfect Moments supply chain, designers, and
took precedence over all other wholesalers. The change allows management to continue building the foundations of future growth through
better delivery times, improved quality, consistency, and extend our supplier relationships which will better serve our wholesale partners
and direct to consumer channels, driving longer terms sustainable revenue growth.

Revenue 

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,833 compared to 5,888 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a
decrease of 2,055 or 35 . The decrease is primarily attributed to a collaboration with Hugo Boss in FY24 that ended FY24. The remaining decrease of 30 is attributed to timing of wholesale shipments of 120 or 4 offset by an increase in ecommerce
of 90 or 8 attributed to enhanced brand awareness and the company s focus on ecommerce. Ecommerce gross revenue increased to
 1,671 an increase of 356 or 27 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The end of season sale for autumn/winter 2023
(AW23) included an unusually high percentage of product sold at a discount, making way for a significant new collection replacing
many of our product lines for autumn/winter 2024 (AW24), in part due to an upcoming change in legislation in some of our markets for
the use of Durable Water Repellency treatments. The Company experiences higher return rates on discounted products and for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, our returns as a percentage of sales increased to 31 from 23 for the six months ended September
30, 2023. 

The Company
did not look to extend the two-year collaboration with Hugo Boss as the relationship required the use of Perfect Moments supply chain, designers, and
took precedence over all other wholesalers. The change allows management to continue building the foundations of future growth through
better delivery times, improved quality, consistency, and extend our supplier relationships which will better serve our wholesale partners
and direct to consumer channels, driving longer terms sustainable revenue growth. 

Cost
of goods sold 

Cost
of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,762 compared to 2,609 for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
a decrease of 847 or 32 . The change in cost of goods sold is primarily attributed to a decline in sales. 

Gross
profit and gross margin 

Our
gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,071 compared to 3,279 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 1,208 or 37 . The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributed to a collaboration with Hugo Boss that ended in FY24. Our gross margins were 54 compared to 56 in the prior year. Improving our gross margins remains an
important focus, and we anticipate our gross margins in our current fiscal year 2025 to significantly improve year-over-year. We are
making significant progress across all our margin expansion projects including opening our first U.S. distribution center in October 2024. Following the facility opening, we realized an immediate improvement in operating efficiency. We will experience reduced duty costs for ecommerce orders in the second half of this fiscal year, which will drive
improved gross margins compared to last year. The decrease in gross margin for the current quarter is attributed to the continuation
of the end of season sale for autumn/winter 2023 (AW23) that included an unusually high percentage of product sold at a discount,
making way for a significant new collection replacing many of our product lines for autumn/winter 2024 (AW24), in part due to an
upcoming change in legislation in some of our markets for the use of Durable Water Repellency treatments. In addition, the Company
had a greater percentage of ecommerce sales versus wholesale sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
September 30, 2023. Ecommerce margins are historically lower than wholesale. 

The
Company has reclassified certain costs totaling 614 and 991 previously classified as cost of sales for the three and six months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively, to SG A expenses to conform to the current year presentation. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses SG A 

SG A
expenses consist of personnel related expenses, stock compensation expense, legal and professional fees, depreciation and amortization,
other selling, information technology, occupancy costs, travel and product sample costs. 

SG A
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3,923 compared to 2,693 for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
an increase of 1,230 or 46 . The increase is primarily attributed to an increase in stock compensation expense of 667, an increase
in people costs to support growth initiatives totaling 204, an increase in warehousing and merchant services due to increased returns
totaling 152, increased legal and professional fees of 119 attributed to the ASC litigation that has been settled and incremental public
company costs, dues and subscriptions of 83 primarily attributed to NYSE, and increased insurance cost of 75 attributed to D O. 

Marketing
and advertising expense 

Marketing
and advertising expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 705 compared to 888 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 183 or 21 . The decrease is primarily attributed to lower event costs 277 leveraging our
collaboration with Diageo as the management is focused on lowering costs and return on investment, offset by the timing of
photoshoots of 67, and digital marketing costs of 55 to support growth.

Use
of Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA 

In
addition to our results under generally accepted accounted principles GAAP ), we present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental
measure of our performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative
to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow
from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation, financing costs and changes in fair value of derivative liability. 

Management
considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of
the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations in that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them
appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that
are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed
as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We
present adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on
a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Adjusted
EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts, and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in
evaluating potential acquisitions; and in making compensation decisions and in communications with our board of directors concerning
our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on
 our debts; and 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in
 the future, and the Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 

Seasonality
and Quarterly Trends 

Our
business is seasonal with revenue concentrated in northern hemisphere countries. Revenue is elevated in the quarters ending September
30, December 31 and March 31 driven by sales of ski and outerwear through the fall and winter months. Our growth rate fluctuates quarter-on-quarter
as a result of the seasonality of our business. We expect this fluctuation to continue. In addition to seasonality, quarter-on-quarter
results are expected to be impacted by the timing of goods production and delivery, promotional activities and the addition of new products
and geographies as the business grows. The business is also subject to the impact of economic cycles that influence retail apparel trends. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 725, restricted cash of 1,825 and an accumulated deficit of 55,109. Historically,
Perfect Moment has generated negative cash flows from operations and has primarily financed its operations through private and public
sales of equity securities, debt and working capital finance. Overall, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, in aggregate, decreased
by 5,360 million, from 7,910 million as of March 31, 2024 to 2,550 million as of September 30, 2024. 

The Company, through
PMA, has a trade finance facility extended on goods for which letters of credit are issued to the Company s suppliers by HSBC. As
of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 the Company had an trade finance facility limit of 2,700 and 5,000 respectively. 

Amounts owed relating
to issued letters of credit do not become the Company s responsibility until the Company receives the manufactured clothing goods
from suppliers. Once drawn, the company has the option of 195 days credit, in the form of a loan, before repayment is due. For drawings
in Hong Kong dollars, the interest rate equals HIBOR plus 3.0 , and for drawings in U.S. dollars, the interest rate equals SOFR plus 3.3 . 

As of September 30,
2024 and March 31, 2024 the outstanding balance under the trade finance facility was 906 and 0 respectively. As of September 30,
2024 and March 31, 2024, there was 1,941 and 0, respectively, in outstanding pledged letters of credit by HSBC. As of September 30,
2024 , total pledged letters of credit and trade loans sum to 2,845, which was secured by a charge of 1,825, held as restricted cash held
with HSBC. The trade finance facility is also secured by a guarantee by Perfect Moment Ltd. in the amount of 2.0 million. 

31 

We
expect operating losses and negative cash flows from operations to continue into the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in growing
our business and expanding our infrastructure. Our primary uses of cash include personnel and marketing expenditures, inventory, capital
investment and expenditures in technology and incremental expenses arising from distribution center operating costs to support our operations
and our growth. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are mainly held in U.S. dollar, U.K. pound sterling, Hong Kong
dollar, and euro cash accounts with high credit quality financial institutions. As a result of the seasonality of our business, we typically
draw down on our trade finance facilities during summer, fall and early winter to meet a large proportion of the cost of goods associated
with the manufacture of our fall/winter collection. Trade finance and debt factoring facilities support our working capital cycle through
to the late fall/winter season when wholesale receivables are paid and ecommerce revenues increase. 

Our
ability to fund inventory, capital expenditures, and growth will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our future ability
to generate cash from operations is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions.
Based on our current level of operations, we believe our existing cash balances and expected cash flows from operations, alongside the
continuance of our existing financing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 6 months,
excluding financing to support production (i.e. timing of working capital). We may seek additional or alternative debt and equity financing
to that set out above. If we raise equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests.
If we conduct additional debt financing, the terms of such debt financing may be similar or more restrictive that the terms of our current
financing arrangements and we would have additional debt service obligations. In the event that additional financing is required from
outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when
desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. See the sections set forth in our other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K, titled Risk Factors Risks Related to Ownership of
Our Common Stock Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our
2021 Equity Incentive Plan, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and Risk
Factors Risks Related to Our Business, Our Brand, Our Products and Our Industry We have a history of losses, expect to
continue to incur losses in the near term and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future, and as a result, our management
has identified and our auditors reported that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, includes a going concern explanatory paragraph in which such firm expressed that there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly
Report do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue
as a going concern, holders of our securities might lose their entire investment. As discussed above, although we plan to attempt to
raise additional capital through one or more private placements or public offerings, the doubts raised relating to our ability to continue
as a going concern may make our shares an unattractive investment for potential investors. These factors, among others, may make it difficult
to raise any additional capital and may cause us to be unable to continue to operate our business.

Cash
used in investing activities was 102 in the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 82 in the six months ended September 31, 2023,

Net
cash obtained from financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was 2,026 primarily resulting from 2,179 net
proceeds from the issuance of common shares and 847 in proceeds from trade finance facilities, offset by 875 repayment of trade finance

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose
entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of those consolidated financial statements requires
our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses
incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of asset and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements include reserves for uncollectible accounts receivables; realizability of inventory; customer returns; useful lives and impairments
of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes and related uncertain tax positions; and the valuation of stock-based
compensation awards. Actual results may differ from these judgements and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any
such differences may be material. 

We
believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies
relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgements and estimates. 

Revenue
recognition 

The
majority of the Company s revenue is recognized at a point in time based on the transfer of control. In addition, the majority
of the Company s contracts do not contain variable consideration and contract modifications are minimal. The majority of the Company s
revenue arrangements generally consists of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods. Revenue is reported net of markdowns,
discounts and sales taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities. Revenue is also presented net of an allowance for
expected returns where contracts include the right of return. 

We
estimate returns on an ongoing basis to estimate the consideration from the customer that we expect to ultimately receive. Consideration
in determining our estimates for returns may include agreements with customers, the Company s return policy and historical and
current trends. We record the returns as a reduction to net sales in our consolidated statements of operations and the recognition of
a provision for returns within accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and the estimated value of inventory expected to be
returned as an adjustment to inventories, net. 

33 

Revenue
is comprised of direct-to-consumer ecommerce revenue through the Company s website and revenue related to wholesalers. 

Revenue
is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company s customers.
Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product.
This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. For direct-to-consumer
ecommerce revenue, the Company receives payment before the customer receives the promised goods. Revenue is only recognized once the
goods have been delivered to the customer. Sales to wholesale customers are recognized when the customer has control which will depend
on the agreed upon International Commercial Terms inco-terms ). For inventories sold on consignment to wholesalers, the
Company records revenue when the inventory is sold to the third-party customer by the wholesaler. The Company may issue merchant credits,
which are essentially refund credits. The merchant credits are initially deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue when tendered
for payment. 

The
Company s business is significantly affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail apparel businesses. Historically,
the Company has recognized a significant portion of its revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year as a result of increased net
revenue during the ski season. 

Accounts
receivable 

Accounts
receivable primarily arise out of sales to wholesale accounts and ecommerce partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents
management s best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable using the incurred loss methodology. Receivables are
written off against the allowance when management believes that it is probable the amount receivable will not be recovered. Additionally,
the Company records higher allowances in the first and third quarters following its peak sales seasons after the Company determines it
to be probable that it will not collect the related receivables. 

Inventories 

Inventories,
consisting of finished goods, inventories in transit, and raw materials, are initially recognized at cost and subsequently measured at
the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and is comprised of all costs of purchases,
costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 

The
Company periodically reviews its inventories and makes a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have
quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net
realizable value based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes
in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of its inventory below its previous estimate, the Company
would increase its provision in the period in which it made such a determination. 

In
addition, the Company provides for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventory counts. Inventory shrinkage
estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. The Company performs a physical inventory at least count once
a year and adjusts the shrinkage reserve accordingly. 

Stock-based
compensation 

The
Company maintains the 2021 Plan, which provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance units and performance shares to employees, directors and consultants
of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company. The purpose of the 2021 Plan is to enable the Company to attract and retain
the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors and
consultants of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the company, and to promote the success of the Company s business. The
Company has historically granted stock options to non-employees in exchange for the provision of services, both under the 2021 Plan and
outside of the 2021 Plan. 

The
Company accounts for such awards based on ASC 505 and 718, whereby the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized
as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company measures fair value as of the grant date for options
and warrants using the Black Scholes option pricing model and for common share awards using a weighted average of the Black Scholes method
and probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM). 

The
inputs into the Black Scholes option pricing model are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of the shares
of common and preferred stock has historically been determined by the Company s management with the assistance of third-party specialists
as there was no public market for the common stock. The fair value is obtained by considering a number of objective and subjective factors,
including the valuation of comparable companies, sales of preferred stock to unrelated third parties, projected operating and financial
performance, the lack of liquidity of common and preferred stock and general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst other factors.
The expected term represents the period that the Company s stock options are expected to be outstanding and is determined using
the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term) as the Company s stock
option exercise history does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. Because the Company is privately held
and does not have an active trading market for its common and preferred stock for a sufficient period of time, the expected volatility
was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded companies, over a period equal to the expected term of the
stock option grants. The risk-free rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for
periods corresponding with the expected term of the option. The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate
paying dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risk primarily include: 

Interest
rate risk 

The
fair value of our cash equivalents, held primarily in cash deposits, have not been significantly impacted by increases or decreases in
interest rates to date, due to the short term nature of these instruments. The interest expense associated with our letter of credit
trade finance facility and debt factoring facilities are composed of a fixed spread over HIBOR or SOFR. The fee associated with revenue
financing is fixed and the interest rate on our convertible bridge loan is accrued at a fixed rate also. We are exposed to interest rate
risk where the interest expense associated with our financing arrangements is depending upon HIBOR or SOFR, a floating reference rate,
or in the event that the fixed interest rate associated with our financing arrangements is increased upon roll-over of the financing
arrangement at its contractual maturity. Fluctuations in interest rates have not been significant to date. We do not expect that interest
rates will have a material impact on our results of operations, owing to the size and short-term nature of the floating rate financing
arrangements and the fixed rate nature of the convertible bridge loan that is expect to convert to equity before its contractual maturity
on February 15, 2024. 

Inflation
risk 

We
are beginning to observe increases in our costs of goods sold, in particular, transportation costs. If these cost increases are sustained
and we become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability to do
so could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

34 

Foreign
exchange risk 

To
date, revenue has primarily been generated in U.S. dollar, U.K. pound sterling and euro. As a result, our revenue may be subject to fluctuations
due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in U.K. pound sterling and euros relative to the U.S. dollar.
Our foreign exchange risk is less pronounced for our cost of sales as to our cost of goods sold being predominantly U.S. dollar denominated.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily made up of U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, U.K. pound sterling and euro
amounts. Although a portion of our non-U.S. dollar costs offset non-U.S. dollar revenue, a currency mismatch arises as to the amount
and timing of our different currency cash flows. To date, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure. We will continue to monitor
the impact of foreign exchange risk and review whether to implement a hedging strategy to minimize this risk in future accounting periods.
Hedging strategies where implemented are unlikely to completely mitigate this risk. To the extent that foreign exchange risk is not hedged
it may result in harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

ITEM
3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not

ITEM
4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under
the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December
31, 2023. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
