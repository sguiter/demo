The
Company performs a qualitative assessment for each of its reporting units to determine if the two-step process for impairment testing
is required. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount, the Company would then evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit
level. In the first step, the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill. In the case that the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting
unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between
the fair values of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting unit. If the
implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value, the difference is recognized as impairment.

subsidiary of the Company. 

Since
that time, the Company has exclusively focused on its Just Right Productions operations, which includes a diverse vertical integrated
business consisting of a retail sales division, screen print promotions, embroidery production, digital production, import wholesale
sourcing, and uniforms. 

On
April 27, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Innovative Impressions, Inc., a Texas corporation (the Seller 
or Innovative Impressions ), pursuant to which the Company acquired embroidery equipment, inventory, and related assets
from the Seller, which was paid by the issuance by the Company of a 200,000 secured promissory note (with a fair value of 143,637)

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenues 

Our
revenue was 2,166,235 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,984,193 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, resulting in an increase of 127,960, or 12 , between the periods. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in Q3
school uniform sales and an expected increase in promotional product sales from new government contract sales. 

Operating
Expenses 

Direct
costs of revenues were 1,600,925 and 1,389,608 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, resulting in
an increase of 211,317, or 15 , between the periods. The increase in direct costs was a result of the increased school uniform sales
as compared to the comparative period during the prior year. The gross margin decreased from 30 during the three months ended September
30, 2023, to 26 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

General
and administrative expenses were 393,890 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 400,658 for the same period in
2023. The decrease in 2024 general and administrative expenses of approximately 2 was primarily due to recognized administrative
efficiencies gained since our second quarter 2023 acquisition of assets from Innovative Impressions. 

Marketing
and selling expenses were 9,977 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7,793 for the same period in 2023. The increase
in 2024 marketing and selling expenses was primarily due to our continued investment in web marketing. We are pivoting to a stronger online
presence, as we feel it beneficial to invest in future web development and online sales. 

Net
income was 125,809 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 155,609 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, for the reasons stated above. 

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenues 

Our
revenue was 4,444,973 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,915,887 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
resulting in an increase of 163,242, or 13 , between the periods. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased sales from recently
acquired brands, and increased school uniform sales. 

Operating
Expenses 

Direct
costs of revenues were 3,122,367 and 2,703,206 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, resulting in an
increase of 419,161, or 16 , between the periods. The increase in direct costs was a result of the increased sales for the most
recent nine-month period as compared to the comparative period during the prior year. The gross margin decreased from 31 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 30 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

General
and administrative expenses were 1,191,459 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,065,307 for the same period
in 2023. The increase in 2024 general and administrative expenses of approximately 12 was primarily due to increased Q1 and Q2
expenses related to the second quarter 2023 acquisition of assets from Innovative Impressions and the additional resources needed
to service newly acquired government contracts. 

Marketing
and selling expenses were 27,303 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 28,300 for the same period in 2023. The
decrease in 2024 marketing and selling expenses of approximately 4 was primarily due to decreased traditional marketing methods
needed to acquire new government contracts. 

Net
income was 48,374 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 162,560 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, for the reasons stated above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 

We
had cash provided by operations of 559,125 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operations of
 350,520 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in positive cash flow from operating activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to changes to operating assets and liabilities. 

We
had cash used in investing activities of 1,729,585 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 230,570 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The change in cash flow from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was attributable
to an increase in the purchase of property and equipment in 2024. 

We
had cash provided by financing activities of 1,618,201 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by financing
activities of 144,153 for the same period in 2023. Cash used in financing activities consisted of proceeds from notes payable offset
by repayments on notes payable. 

We
will likely have to raise funds to pay for growth and acquisitions. We may have to borrow money from shareholders or issue debt or equity
or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us.
We currently have no arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other
sources. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and
assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions. 

See
Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1, Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies in our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K as filed on April 16, 2024, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.
