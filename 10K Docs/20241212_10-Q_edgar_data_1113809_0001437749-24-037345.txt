Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

of consolidated revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The majority of these sales transactions were single performance obligations that were recorded when control of merchandise was transferred to the customer. 
 
 The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue, by reportable segment. 
 
 The Company s direct-to-consumer segment includes the operating activities of corporately-managed stores, other retail-delivered operations and e-commerce demand (orders generated online to be fulfilled from either the Company's warehouse or its stores). Direct-to-consumer revenue is recognized when control of the merchandise is transferred to the customer and for the Company's online sales, generally upon estimated delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration, including any discounts or incentives, the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the merchandise. Product returns have historically averaged less than one -half of one percent due to the personalized and interactive nature of its products, where consumers customize their own stuffed animal. The Company has elected to exclude from revenue all collected sales, value added, and other taxes paid by its customers. 
 
 For the Company s gift cards, revenue is deferred for single transactions until redemption including any related gift card discounts. Approximately of gift cards are redeemed within three years of issuance and over the last three years, approximately of gift cards issued have been redeemed within the first twelve months. In addition, unredeemed gift cards or breakage revenue is recorded in proportion to the customers redemption pattern using an estimated breakage rate based on historical experience. Subsequent to stores reopening following shutdowns caused by the pandemic, the Company experienced lower redemptions of its gift cards for all periods of outstanding activated cards compared to pre-pandemic redemption patterns (fiscal year 2019 and earlier), which impacts the gift card breakage rate. The Company does not believe that the redemption pattern experienced during the pandemic reflects the pattern in the future and has adjusted the historical redemption data used to calculate the breakage rate. The Company continues to evaluate expected breakage annually and adjusts the breakage rates in the fourth quarter of each year, or at other times if significant changes in customer behavior are detected. Changes to breakage estimates impact revenue recognition prospectively. Further, given the magnitude of the Company's gift card liability, the changes in breakage rates could have a significant impact on the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods. As a matter of sensitivity, a hypothetical change in our gift card breakage rate in fiscal 2023 would have resulted in a change in breakage revenue of million. 
 
 For certain qualifying transactions, a portion of revenue transactions are deferred for the obligation related to the Company s loyalty program or when a material right in the form of a future discount is granted. In these transactions, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for the points earned for the Company s loyalty program is estimated using the net retail value of the merchandise purchased, adjusted for estimated breakage based on historical redemption patterns. The revenue associated with the initial merchandise purchased is recognized immediately and the value assigned to the points is deferred until the points are redeemed, forfeited or expired. The Company issues certificates daily to loyalty program members who have earned 100 or more points in North America and 50 points or more in the U.K. with certificates historically expiring in six months if not redeemed. The Company assesses the redemption rates of its certifications on a quarterly basis to update the rate at which loyalty program points turn into certifications and the rate that certifications are redeemed. In regard to the consolidated balance sheet, contract liabilities related to the loyalty program are classified as deferred revenue and other. 
 
 The Company s commercial segment includes transactions with other businesses and is mainly comprised of licensing the Company s intellectual properties for third -party use and wholesale sales of merchandise, including supplies and fixtures. Revenue for wholesale sales is recognized when control of the merchandise or fixtures is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery to the customer. The license agreements provide the customer with highly interrelated rights that are not distinct in the context of the contract and therefore, have been accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized as licensee sales occur. If the contract includes a guaranteed minimum, the minimum guarantee is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guarantee term until such time as royalties earned through licensee sales exceed the minimum guarantee. The Company classifies these guaranteed minimum contract liabilities as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The Company s international franchising segment includes the activities with franchisees who operate store locations in certain countries and includes development fees, sales-based royalties and merchandise, including supplies and fixture sales. The Company's obligations under the franchise agreements are ongoing and include operations and product development support and training, generally concentrated around initial store openings. These obligations are highly interrelated rights that are not distinct in the context of the contract and, therefore, have been accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized as franchisee sales occur. If the contract includes an initial, one -time nonrefundable development fee, this fee is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement, which may extend for periods up to years. The Company classifies these initial, one -time nonrefundable franchise fee contract liabilities as deferred revenue on its consolidated balance sheet. Revenue from merchandise and fixture sales is recognized when control is transferred to the franchisee, which generally occurs upon delivery. 
 
 The Company also incurs expenses directly related to the startup of new franchises, which may include finder s fees, legal and travel costs, expenses related to its ongoing support of the franchises and employee compensation. Accordingly, the Company s policy is to capitalize any finder s fee, as an incremental cost, and expense all other costs as incurred. Additionally, the Company amortizes these capitalized costs into expense in the same pattern as the development fee's recording of revenue as described previously. These capitalized costs for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 are not material to the financial statements. 
 
 The Company reserves for expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit rather than the incurred loss model. These expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , the Company's accounts receivable are net of million and million, inclusive of the allowance for credit losses and the reserve for the UK's customs authority "HMRC" matter of million and million, respectively. See Note 12 for further discussion of the HMRC matter.

 Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by the federal securities laws. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those detailed under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, as filed with the SEC, and include the following: 

any uncertainty or decline in general global economic conditions, caused by inflation, rising interest rates, geo-political conflicts, or other external factors, could lead to disproportionately reduced discretionary consumer spending and a corresponding reduction in demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability; 

consumer interests can change rapidly, and our success depends on the ongoing effectiveness of our marketing and online initiatives to build consumer affinity for our brand and drive consumer demand for our products and services; 

we depend upon the shopping malls and tourist locations in which our stores are located to attract guests. Continued or further volatility in retail consumer traffic could adversely affect our financial performance and profitability; 

our profitability could be adversely affected by fluctuations in petroleum products prices; 

our business may be adversely impacted at any time by a variety of significant competitive threats; 

global or regional health pandemics or epidemics could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of operations; 

if we are unable to generate interest in and demand for our interactive retail experience and products, including being able to identify and respond to consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales, financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected; 

if we are unable to renew, renegotiate or replace our store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate any of the terms of our current leases, our revenue and profitability could be harmed; 

failure to successfully execute our omnichannel and brand expansion strategy and the cost of our investments in e-commerce and digital transformation may materially adversely affect our financial condition and profitability; 

we are subject to risks associated with technology and digital operations;

Business Overview 
 
 Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1997 as a mall-based, experiential specialty retailer. Build-A-Bear has evolved to become a beloved multi-generational brand focused on its mission to add a little more heart to life where guests of all ages make their own furry friends in celebration and commemoration of life moments. Guests create their own stuffed animals by participating in the stuffing, dressing, accessorizing, and naming of their own teddy bears and other plush toys based on the Company s own intellectual property and in conjunction with a variety of best-in-class licenses. The hands-on and interactive nature of our more than 500 company-owned, partner-operated and franchise experience locations around the world, combined with Build-A-Bear s pop-culture appeal, often fosters a lasting and emotional brand connection with consumers, and has enabled the Company to expand beyond its retail stores to include e-commerce sales on www.buildabear.com and non-plush branded consumer categories via out-bound licensing agreements with leading manufacturers, as well as the creation of engaging content via Build-A-Bear Entertainment (a subsidiary of Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc.). Over the last 27 years, Build-A-Bear has become a brand with high consumer awareness, positive affinity, and strong retail influence by leveraging our brand strength to grow our brick-and-mortar retail footprint beyond traditional malls through a range of store sizes, formats and locations including tourist destinations. We are also growing through our websites, which focus on gift-giving, collectible merchandise, and licensed products. In addition to growing our corporately-managed store and e-commerce footprint, we are also growing through third-party operated and franchised stores, particularly for our international expansion. Our ongoing digital transformation, which touches our e-commerce business, consumer loyalty program and digital marketing and content, has led to omni-channel growth over the past several years. Build-A-Bear's pop-culture appeal has played a key role in growing our total addressable market beyond children by adding teens and adults with entertainment and sports licensing, collectible and gifting offerings, as well as by introducing new products and adding categories beyond plush. 
 
 We primarily operate through a vertical retail channel with corporately-managed stores that feature a unique combination of experience and product in which guests can make their own stuffed animals. We also operate e-commerce sites that focus on gift-giving, collectible merchandise and licensed products that appeal to consumers that have an affinity for characters from a range of entertainment, sports, art, and gaming properties. Our retail stores also act as mini distribution centers that provide efficient omnichannel support for our growing digital demand. The primary consumer target for our brick-and-mortar locations is families with children, while our e-commerce sites focus on collectors and gift givers that are primarily tweens, teens and adults. Additionally, we offer products in non-plush consumer categories via outbound licensing agreements with leading manufacturers. 
 
 Our strategy includes leveraging our brand strength to continue to strategically evolve our brick-and-mortar retail footprint beyond traditional malls with a versatile range of formats and locations including tourist destinations, expand into international markets primarily via our partner-operated and franchise store models, and grow our e-commerce business. By leveraging our brand strength and owned intellectual properties through the creation of engaging short-form and long-form content for kids and adults, we endeavor to develop a circle of continuous engagement to increase purchase occasions and to continue to broaden the consumer base beyond children by adding tweens, teens and adults with entertainment and sports licensing, plus collectible and gifting offerings. 
 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had 362 corporately-managed stores globally and 4 seasonal locations, 123 partner-operated locations operating through our "third-party retail" model in which we sell our products on a wholesale basis to other companies that execute our retail experience, and 80 international franchised stores, all under the Build-A-Bear Workshop brand. In addition to these stores, we sell products on our company-owned e-commerce sites and third-party marketplace sites, our franchisees sell products through sites that they manage as well as other third-party marketplace sites and other parties sell products on their sites under wholesale agreements. 
 
 We operate in three segments that share the same infrastructure, including management, systems, merchandising and marketing, and generate revenues as follows: 

Direct-to-Consumer DTC Corporately-managed retail stores located in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Ireland and two e-commerce sites; 

Commercial Transactions with other businesses, mainly comprised of wholesale product sales to third-party retailers and licensing our intellectual property, including entertainment properties, for third-party use; and 

International franchising Royalties as well as products and fixtures sales from other international operations under franchise agreements. 

Selected financial data attributable to each segment for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 are set forth in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Business Update 
 
 Build-A-Bear Workshop offers interactive entertainment experiences via both physical and e-commerce engagement, targeting a range of consumer segments and purchasing occasions through digitally-driven, diversified omnichannel capabilities. We operate a vertical retail channel with stores that feature a unique combination of experience and product in which guests can "make their own stuffed animals" by participating in the stuffing, dressing, accessorizing, and naming of their teddy bears and other stuffed animals. We also operate e-commerce sites that focus on gift-giving, collectible merchandise and licensed products that appeal to consumers that have an affinity for characters from a range of licensed properties. Over the last 27 years, Build-A-Bear has become a brand with high consumer awareness and positive affinity. We believe there are opportunities to leverage this brand strength, pop-culture status and multi-generational appeal and generate incremental revenue and profits through licensing our intellectual properties through content and entertainment development for kids and adults while also offering products at wholesale and in non-plush consumer categories through outbound licensing agreements with leading manufacturers. 
 
 We seek to provide outstanding guest service and experiences across all channels and touch points including our retail locations, our e-commerce sites, our mobile sites and apps as well as traditional, digital and social media. We believe the hands-on and interactive nature of our experience locations, our personal service model and engaging digital shopping experiences result in guests forming an emotional connection with our brand which has multi-generational appeal that captures today s zeitgeist including desire for engaging experiences, personalization and DIY while being recognized as trusted, giving, and a part of pop culture. 
 
 We believe that the initiatives and investments that were put in place prior to the pandemic, and in many cases, we accelerated during the pandemic, are driving improved results, as we delivered growth in total revenues and profit in fiscal 2023. To continue to drive revenue and profit growth, we remain focused on our strategic priorities, which are centered primarily on three key areas: 

The global expansion of our unique experience locations. During the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024, we opened a net 40 Build-A-Bear Workshop retail experience locations, through a combination of corporately-managed, third-party operated, and franchise business models. In fiscal 2024, we expect net new unit growth of at least 65 locations in North America and internationally through our three store business models. We have made a concerted effort to shift to non-traditional locations, including family-centric tourist and hospitality sites, as well as partner-operated and franchise locations, and now have more than a third of total stores in non-traditional settings. While tourist sites have been and will remain a critical part of our location expansion strategy, recent research data supports our opportunity to reengage in profitable expansion in traditional locations on a more localized level, particularly given the numerous and flexible corporate store models we have developed in the past few years. We also continue to develop innovative experiences to expand our brand reach, including Build-A-Bear vending machines, also known as ATMs or automatic teddy machines. 

Accelerate our comprehensive digital transformation. In addition to growing our e-commerce channel, this includes our marketing and loyalty programs, including our Count Your Candles offer, and content and entertainment initiatives, such as our first-ever animated theatrical film in 2023 Glisten and the Merry Mission. Our digital transformation is designed to elevate our business efficiency, integrate our customer communications to acquire new customers and increase purchase occasions, and expand our total addressable market by reaching beyond our core kid base and to continue to acquire new tween, teen and adult consumers by new offerings including gifting and personalization programs. In September 2024, we created a new position of Chief Revenue Officer to further align our operating structure with our digital strategy. 

Drive profitable growth through investment initiatives while maintaining a commitment to return capital to shareholders. As corporate store operating margins have remained robust from higher levels of revenue combined with disciplined expense management, particularly considering recent inflationary pressures, wage increases and supply chain challenges, and as we continue to evolve our real estate portfolio with new locations and formats, plus shift to asset-light business models, the company s cash flows have meaningfully improved. This higher-level of cash flows has been used to increase support for key initiatives to deliver long-term profitable growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Company returned capital to shareholders through two special dividends paid December 27, 2021, and April 6, 2023, totaling 42 million, through share repurchases from a 25 million stock repurchase program that was adopted in November 2021, through a 50 million stock repurchase program announced in August 2022, and through a Board-approved 100 million stock repurchase program announced in September 2024. Furthermore, the Company announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend program on March 13, 2024, and during the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2024, the Company declared cash dividends of 0.20 per share, totaling 2.9 million, 2.7 million and 2.7 million, respectively. Additionally, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.20 per share on the issued and outstanding common stock of the company, which will be paid on January 9 , 2025 , to all stockholders of record as of Novem ber 27, 2024 .

As of November 2, 2024, 51 of our corporately-managed stores were in an updated Discovery format. We also expect to close certain stores in accordance with natural lease events as an ongoing part of our real estate management and day-to-day operational plans. The future of our retail store fleet may include expansion into more non-traditional locations, including concourse format shops and by expansion in other locations outside of traditional malls.

Through our third-party retail model, there were 123 stores in operation at the end of the third quarter of 2024 with relationships that included Carnival Cruise Line, Great Wolf Lodge Resorts, Landry's and Girl Scouts of the USA. The third-party retail model is capital light for us, with the partner company building out and operating the workshops including providing the real estate location and covering the cost of labor and inventory, which is purchased from us on a wholesale basis. These locations are heavily weighted to the hospitality industry, which allow us to further advance our focus on experience location expansion in non-traditional and tourist areas, as well as shop-in-shop arrangements within other retailers stores. 
 
 International Franchise Stores: 
 
 Our first franchisee location was opened in November 2003. All franchised stores have similar signage, store layout, merchandise characteristics and guest experience as our corporately-managed stores. As of November 2, 2024, we had 5 master franchise agreements, which typically grant franchise rights for a particular country or group of countries, covering an aggregate of 8 countries.

In the ordinary course of business, we anticipate signing additional master franchise agreements in the future and terminating other such agreements. We source fixtures and other supplies for our franchisees from China which significantly reduces the capital and lowers the expenses required to open franchises. We are leveraging new formats that have been developed for our corporately-managed locations such as concourses and shop-in-shops with our franchisees.

Thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023 
 
 Total revenues. Consolidated revenues increased 11.0 , primarily driven by a 9.1 million or 9.1 increase in Net Retail sales and a 2.6 million or 43 increase in Commercial revenue when compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2023. The increase in net retail sales was driven primarily by growth at existing stores. The increased commercial revenue was due to higher sales from our wholesale customers that was driven by new wholesale customers and opening 38 third-party retail stores since the third quarter of 2023. 

Net retail sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 were 109.5 million, compare d to 100.4 mi llion for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. The components of the improved performance are as follows (dollars in thousands):

Table of Contents 

Commercial revenue was 8.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 6.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023.

 Retail gross margin. Retail gross margin dollars increased 6.5 million to 59.4 million from 52.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state income tax expense. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets expected to be realized in the U.K. The Company remains in a full valuation in certain other foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 Thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023

Selling, general and administrative. SG A expenses were 148.4 million, or 42.9 of consolidated revenue, for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 140.5 million, or 41.7 of consolidated revenue, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in overall expense was driven by higher wage rates, expense timing and general inflationary pressures. 
 
 Interest income, net. Interest income was 0.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to interest income of 0.5 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in interest income compared to the prior year is the result of the Company's cash management strategy to invest cash on-hand in short-term, highly liquid investments. 
 
 Provision for income taxes . Income tax expense was 9.5 million with a tax rate of 24.1 for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared to 9.6 million with a tax rate of 24.0 for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets expected to be realized in the U.K. The Company remains in a full valuation in certain other foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization 
 
 We believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") provides meaningful information about our operational efficiency by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and capital investment. Additionally, this measure is the metric used for portions of the Company's incentive compensation structure. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is income before income taxes, or pre-tax income. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate EBIT and EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparisons with other companies. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the components of EBITDA (dollars in millions):

EBITDA for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 increased 3.4 million, or 25.3 to 16.7 million from 13.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase was driven by gross profit driven by increased retail and commercial margins partially offset by higher SG A expenses. 
 
 EBITDA for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, increased 0.7 million, or 1.5 , to 49.9 million from 49.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in EBITDA was driven by retail and commercial margins partially offset by higher SG A expenses. 
 
 Seasonality and Quarterly Results 
 
 Our operating results for one period may not be indicative of results for other periods, and may fluctuate significantly because of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) changes in general economic conditions (including as a result of the pandemic) and consumer spending patterns; (2) changes in store operations in response to the pandemic apart from its effect on the general economy, including temporary store closures required by local governments; (3) increases or decreases in our existing store and e-commerce sales; (4) fluctuations in the profitability of our stores; (5) the timing and frequency of the sales of licensed products tied to major theatrical releases (including the cancellation or delay of such releases due to the pandemic or other external factors) and our marketing initiatives, including national media and other public relations events; (6) changes in foreign currency exchange rates; (7) the timing of new store openings, closings, relocations and remodeling and related expenses; (8) changes in consumer preferences; (9) the effectiveness of our inventory management; (10) the actions of our competitors or mall anchors and co-tenants; (11) seasonal shopping patterns and holiday and vacation schedules; (12) disruptions in store operations due to civil unrest; and (13) weather conditions. 
 
 The timing of store closures, relocations, remodels, openings and re-openings may result in fluctuations in quarterly results based on the revenues and expenses associated with each store location. Expenses related to store closings are typically incurred in stages: when the decision is made to close the store typically associated with a lease event such as an expiration or lease triggered clause; when the closure is communicated to store associates; and at the time of closure. We typically incur most preopening costs for a new store in the three months immediately preceding the store s opening. 
 
 Because our retail operations include toy products which have sales that historically peak in relation to the holiday season as part of our revenue model, our sales have historically been highest in our fourth quarter. The timing of holidays and school vacations can impact our quarterly results. We cannot provide assurance that this will continue to be the case. In addition, for accounting purposes, the quarters of each fiscal year consist of 13 weeks, although we will have a 14-week quarter approximately once every six years. For example, the 2023 fiscal fourth quarter was 14 weeks.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had a consolidated cash balance of 29.0 million, 79 of which w as domiciled within the U.S. Historically, our cash requirements have been primarily for the relocation and remodeling of existing stores in our new design, opening of new stores, investments in information technology infrastructure and working capital. Over the past several years, we have met these requirements through capital generated from cash flow provided by operations. Additionally, during 2024 we have used cash on-hand to invest in short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less resulting in interest income of 0.7 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024. 
 
 A summary of our operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):

Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased 5.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. This decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by increased cash spent on inventory purchases in anticipation of the uncertainty in cost due to potential tariffs and higher accounts receivable resulting from higher commercial revenue offset by increases in payables and accrued expenses. 
 
 Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased 1.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. This decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower spending on capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities decreased 5.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. This decrease in cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by the payment in 2023 fiscal first quarter of a special cash dividend of 22.1 million compared to quarterly dividends of 2.9 million, 2.7 million and 2.7 million paid respectively in the first, second and third fiscal quarters of 2024. This was partially offset by an in crease in repurchases of our common stock during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources: We have a revolving credit and security agreement with PNC Bank, as agent, that provides for a secured revolving loan in aggregate principal of up to 25.0 million, subject to a borrowing base formula. As of November 2, 2024, borrowings under the agreement would bear interest at (a) a base rate determined under the agreement, or (b) the borrower's option, at a rate based on SOFR, plus in either case a margin based on average undrawn availability as determined in accordance with the agreement. As of November 2, 2024, our borrowing base was 25.0 million. As a result of a 250 ,000 letter of credit outstanding against the line of credit, approximately 24.7 million was available for borrowing as of November 2, 2024. We had no outstanding borrowings as of November 2, 2024. 
 
 Most of our corporately-managed retail stores are located within shopping malls and all are operated under leases classified as operating leases. Our leases in North America tend to be shorter term leases to provide flexibility in aligning stores with market trends. During fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024, lease extensions began to have longer terms as we have secured longer contracts with more favorable terms. Our leases typically require us to pay personal property taxes, our pro rata share of real property taxes of the shopping mall, our own utilities, repairs and maintenance in our store, a pro rata share of the malls common area maintenance and, in some instances, merchant association fees and media fund contributions. Many leases contain incentives to help defray the cost of construction of a new store. Typically, a portion of the incentive must be repaid to the landlord if we choose to terminate the lease prior to its contracted term. In addition, some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to change in control of our company. Our leases also subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters, including rights of termination in some cases. Rents are invoiced monthly and paid in advance. 
 
 Our leases in the U.K. and Ireland typically have terms of ten years and generally contain a provision whereby every fifth year the rental rate can be adjusted to reflect the current market rates. The leases typically provide the lessee with the first right for renewal at the end of the lease. We may also be required to make deposits and rent guarantees to secure new leases as we expand. Business rates also change according to government time schedules to reflect current market rental rates for the locations we lease. Rents are invoiced monthly or quarterly and paid in advance.

Capital spending through the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 totaled 9.6 million for information technology projects and new store openings, and we expect to spend approximately 18 to 20 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 . 
 
 Total inventory at quarter end was 70.8 million, an increase of 6.3 million or 10 from the end of the fiscal 2023 third quarter. We accelerated the acquisition of our core products in anticipation of the uncertainty in cost due to potential tariffs. We are comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory. 
 
 We have various contractual or other obligations, including operating lease commitments and obligations under deferred compensation plans. As of November 2, 2024, we had purchase obligations totaling approximately 99.7 million, of whi ch 29.0 million are due in the next 12 months. We believe our operating cash flows are sufficient to meet our material cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 We utili zed 23.0 million in cash to repurchase 832,944 shares during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to using 15.2 million in cash to repurchase 672,734 shares during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. Since the end of the third fiscal quarter, we utilized 0.2 million in cash to repurchase 5,288 shares leaving 97.0 million available under the September 2024 Stock Repurchase Program. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 None. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Global inflation is well above recent levels and global interest rates have risen in an effort to curb inflation. The impact of inflation on the Company's business operations was seen throughout fiscal 2023 and continued to adversely affect our business in fiscal 2024, mainly through rising store labor costs. However, we continue to take mitigating actions, such as select strategic price increases on highly sought-after products and leveraging distribution costs. We expect the inflationary pressures experienced thus far in fiscal 2024 to continue throughout the rest of fiscal 2024, specifically through wage increases. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation on our business operations on an ongoing basis and may need to adjust our prices further to mitigate the impacts of changes to the rate of inflation during 2024 or in future years. Future volatility of general price inflation and the impact of inflation on costs and availability of materials, costs for shipping and warehousing and other operational overhead could adversely affect our financial results. Inflationary pressures may be exacerbated by higher transportation costs due to war and other geopolitical conflicts, such as the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, tension between China and Taiwan, and the Israel-Hamas conflict. We cannot provide an estimate or range of impact that such inflation may have on our future results of operations. However, if we are unable to recover the impact of these costs through price increases to our guests, or if consumer spending decreases as a result of inflation, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, ongoing inflation in product costs may result in lower gross margin rates if we elect to maintain higher inventory reserves to mitigate anticipated higher costs. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. Such differences could be material to the financial statements. 
 
 We believe our application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, leases, revenue recognition and income taxes, are reevaluated on an ongoing basis, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. 
 
 Historically, we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024 as filed with the SEC on April 18, 2024, which includes audited consolidated financial statements for our 2023 and 2022 fiscal years. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our certifying officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 2, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 
 It should be noted that our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
