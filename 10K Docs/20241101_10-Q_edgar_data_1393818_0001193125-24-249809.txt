(b)

Table of Contents 

Our carry funds are commitment-based drawdown structured funds that do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, funds structured like hedge funds and other open-ended funds in our Real Estate, Credit Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments generally have structures that afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, Blackstone has the ability to fulfill redemption requests only (a) in Blackstone s or the vehicles board s discretion, as applicable, or (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital. Investment advisory agreements related to certain separately managed accounts in our Credit Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding separately managed accounts in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 30 to 95 days notice. Separately managed accounts in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone s right to cure. 

Fee-Earning Assets Under Management refers to the assets we manage on which we derive management fees and/or performance revenues. Our Fee-Earning Assets Under Management equals the sum of: 

(a)
 
 for our Private Equity segment funds, Real Estate segment carry funds including certain BREDS funds, and certain Multi-Asset Investing funds, the amount of capital commitments, remaining invested capital, fair value, net asset value or par value of assets held, depending on the fee terms of the fund, 

(b)
 
 for our credit-focused carry funds, the amount of remaining invested capital (which may include leverage) or net asset value, depending on the fee terms of the fund, 

(c)
 
 the remaining invested capital or fair value of assets held in co-investment vehicles managed by us on which we receive fees, 

(d)
 
 the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, BPP, certain co-investments managed by us, certain registered investment companies, BREIT, BEPIF, BXPE and certain of our Multi-Asset Investing drawdown funds, 

(e)
 
 the invested capital, fair value of assets or the net asset value we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts, 

(f)
 
 the net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated distributable earnings of BXMT, subject to certain adjustments, 

(g)
 
 the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of our CLOs, and 

(h)
 
 the gross amount of assets (including leverage) or the net assets for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies and BDCs. 

 Each of our segments may include certain Fee-Earning Assets Under Management on which we earn performance revenues but not management fees. 

 Our calculations of Total Assets Under Management and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. In addition, our calculation of Total Assets Under Management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from Blackstone and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to fees. Our definitions of Total Assets Under Management and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management are not based on any definition of Total Assets Under Management and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage. 

4 

Table of Contents 

 For our carry funds, Total Assets Under Management includes the fair value of the investments held and uncalled capital commitments, whereas Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may include the total amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost, depending on whether the investment period has expired or as specified by the fee terms of the fund. As such, in certain carry funds Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may be greater than Total Assets Under Management when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments. 

 Perpetual Capital refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows. Perpetual Capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. 

 This report does not constitute an offer of any Blackstone Fund.

segments: Real Estate, Private Equity, Credit Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing. 

 Blackstone Inc. was initially formed as The Blackstone Group L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, on March 12, 2007. Prior to its conversion on July 1, 2019 to a Delaware corporation, Blackstone Inc. was managed and operated by Blackstone Group Management L.L.C., which is wholly owned by Blackstone s senior managing directors and controlled by of Blackstone s founders, Stephen A. Schwarzman (the Founder ). 

 The activities of Blackstone are conducted through its holding partnerships: Blackstone Holdings I L.P., Blackstone Holdings AI L.P., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings III L.P. and Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. (collectively, Blackstone Holdings, Blackstone Holdings Partnerships or the Holding Partnerships ). Blackstone, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner of each of the Holding Partnerships. Generally, holders of the limited partner interests in the Holding Partnerships may, four times each year, exchange their limited partnership interests Partnership Units for Blackstone common stock, on a one-to-one basis, exchanging one Partnership Unit from each of the Holding Partnerships for one share of Blackstone common stock. 

In addition, Blackstone consolidates all variable interest entities VIE for which it is the primary beneficiary. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest is defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The consolidation guidance requires an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which Blackstone holds a variable interest is a VIE and (b) whether Blackstone s involvement, through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests, would give it a controlling financial interest. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. 

 Blackstone determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes involved with a variable interest entity and continuously reconsiders that conclusion. In determining whether Blackstone is the primary beneficiary, Blackstone evaluates its control rights as well as economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by Blackstone. The consolidation analysis can generally be performed qualitatively; however, if it is not readily apparent that Blackstone is not the primary beneficiary, a quantitative analysis may also be performed. Investments and redemptions (either by Blackstone, affiliates of Blackstone or third parties) or amendments to the governing documents of the respective Blackstone Funds could affect an entity s status as a VIE or the determination of the primary beneficiary. At each reporting date, Blackstone assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and will consolidate or deconsolidate accordingly. 

 Assets of consolidated VIEs that can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors (or beneficial interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of Blackstone are presented in a separate section in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

 Blackstone s other disclosures regarding VIEs are discussed in Note 9. Variable Interest Entities. 

investment vehicles, but for certain widely held funds or vehicles, the fund or vehicle itself may be identified as the customer. These customer contracts require Blackstone to provide investment management services, which represents a performance obligation that Blackstone satisfies over time. Management fees are a form of variable consideration because the fees Blackstone is entitled to vary based on fluctuations in the basis for the management fee. The amount recorded as revenue is generally determined at the end of the period because these management fees are payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly) and are not subject to clawback once paid. 

 Transaction, advisory and other fees are principally fees charged to the investors of funds indirectly through the managed funds and portfolio companies. The investment advisory agreements generally require that the investment adviser reduce the amount of management fees payable by the investors to Blackstone management fee reductions by an amount equal to a portion of the transaction and other fees paid to Blackstone by the portfolio companies. The amount of the reduction varies by fund, the type of fee paid by the portfolio company and the previously incurred expenses of the fund. These fees and associated management fee reductions are a component of the transaction price for Blackstone s performance obligation to provide investment management services to the investors of funds and are recognized as changes to the transaction price in the period in which they are charged and the services are performed. 

 Management fee offsets are reductions to management fees payable by the investors of the Blackstone Funds, which are based on the amount such investors reimburse the Blackstone Funds or Blackstone primarily for placement fees. Providing investment management services requires Blackstone to arrange for services on behalf of its customers. In those situations where Blackstone is acting as an agent on behalf of the investors of funds, it presents the cost of services as net against management fee revenue. In all other situations, Blackstone is primarily responsible for fulfilling the services and is therefore acting as a principal for those arrangements. As a result, the cost of those services is presented as Compensation or General, Administrative and Other expense, as appropriate, with any reimbursement from the investors of the funds recorded as Management and Advisory Fees, Net. In cases where the investors of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract. Capitalized placement fees are amortized over the life of the customer contract, are recorded within Other Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and amortization is recorded within General, Administrative and Other within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

 Accrued but unpaid Management and Advisory Fees, net of management fee reductions and management fee offsets, as of the reporting date are included in Due from Affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

 Incentive Fees

 Contractual fees earned based on the performance of Blackstone vehicles Incentive Fees are a form of variable consideration in Blackstone s contracts with customers to provide investment management services. Incentive Fees are earned based on performance of the vehicle during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, or high water marks, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each vehicle s governing agreements. Incentive Fees will not be recognized as revenue until (a) it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, or (b) the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Incentive Fees are typically recognized as revenue when realized at the end of the measurement period. Once realized, such fees are not subject to clawback or reversal. Accrued but unpaid Incentive Fees charged directly to investors in Blackstone vehicles as of the reporting date are recorded within Due from Affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

 Investment Income (Loss)

 Investment Income (Loss) represents the unrealized and realized gains and losses on Blackstone s Performance Allocations and Principal Investments. 

In carry fund structures and certain open-ended structures, Blackstone, through its subsidiaries, invests alongside its limited partners in a partnership and is entitled to its pro-rata share of the results of the fund vehicle (a pro-rata allocation ). In addition to a pro-rata allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, Blackstone is entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest Performance Allocations ). 

 Performance Allocations in carry fund structures are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. Performance Allocations in open-ended structures are based on vehicle performance over a period of time, subject to a high water mark and preferred return to investors. At the end of each reporting period, Blackstone calculates the balance of accrued Performance Allocations Accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as Accrued Performance Allocations to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to Blackstone to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, resulting in a negative adjustment to the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner. In each scenario, it is necessary to calculate the Accrued Performance Allocation on cumulative results compared to the Accrued Performance Allocation recorded to date and make the required positive or negative adjustments. Blackstone ceases to record negative Performance Allocations once previously Accrued Performance Allocations for such fund have been fully reversed. Blackstone is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles, and therefore, cannot have negative Performance Allocations over the life of a fund. Accrued Performance Allocations as of the reporting date are reflected in Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

 Performance Allocations in carry fund structures are realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return or, in limited instances, after certain thresholds for return of capital are met. Performance Allocations in carry fund structures are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results. As such, the accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations, which is a component of Due to Affiliates, represents all amounts previously distributed to Blackstone Holdings and non-controlling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the Blackstone carry funds if the Blackstone carry funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds investments as of the reporting date. The actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund s life except for certain funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. Performance Allocations in open-ended structures are realized based on the stated time period in the agreements and are generally not subject to clawback once paid. 

 Principal Investments include the unrealized and realized gains and losses on Blackstone s principal investments, including its investments in Blackstone Funds that are not consolidated and receive pro-rata allocations, its equity method investments, and other principal investments. Income (Loss) on Principal Investments is realized when Blackstone redeems all or a portion of its investment or when Blackstone receives cash income, such as dividends or distributions. Unrealized Income (Loss) on Principal Investments results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment as well as the reversal of unrealized gain (loss) at the time an investment is realized. 

 Interest and Dividend Revenue

 Interest and Dividend Revenue comprises primarily interest and dividend income earned on principal investments not accounted for under the equity method held by Blackstone. 

Other Revenue

 Other Revenue consists of miscellaneous income and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 

The valuation techniques used to value financial instruments classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Debt Instruments and Equity Securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants including those provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. The valuation of certain equity securities is based on an observable price for an identical security adjusted for the effect of a restriction. 

Freestanding Derivatives are valued using contractual cash flows and observable inputs comprising yield curves, foreign currency rates and credit spreads. 

Notes issued by consolidated CLO vehicles are measured based on the more observable fair value of CLO assets less (a) the fair value of any beneficial interests held by Blackstone, and (b) the carrying value of any beneficial interests that represent compensation for services. 

 Level III Valuation Techniques 

In the absence of observable market prices, Blackstone values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist; management s determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances, and may incorporate management s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies, real estate properties, investments in non-consolidated CLO vehicles, certain funds of hedge funds and credit-focused investments. 

 Real Estate Investments

 The fair values of real estate investments are determined by considering projected operating cash flows, sales of comparable assets, if any, and replacement costs, among other measures and considerations. The methods used to estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the discounted cash flow method, where value is calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows and the estimated terminal value of the subject investment by the assumed buyer s weighted-average cost of capital. A terminal value is derived by reference to an exit multiple, such as for estimates of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), or a capitalization rate, such as for estimates of net operating income NOI ). Valuations may also be derived by the performance multiple or market approach, by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or assets (for example, dividing NOI by a relevant capitalization rate observed for comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables. 

 Private Equity Investments

 The fair values of private equity investments are determined by reference to projected net earnings, EBITDA, the discounted cash flow method, public market or private transactions, valuations for comparable companies and other measures which, in many cases, are based on unaudited information at the time received. Where a discounted cash flow method is used, a terminal value is derived by reference to EBITDA or price/earnings exit multiples. Valuations may also be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions (for example, multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company, such as EBITDA, by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables, and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar methods. 

Credit-Focused Investments

 The fair values of credit-focused investments are generally determined on the basis of prices between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. For credit-focused investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, Blackstone may utilize other valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method or a market approach. The discounted cash flow method projects the expected cash flows of the debt instrument based on contractual terms, and discounts such cash flows back to the valuation date using a market-based yield. The market-based yield is generally estimated using yields of publicly traded debt instruments issued by companies operating in similar industries as the subject investment or based on changes in credit spreads of a broader benchmark index applicable to a subject investment. 

 The market approach is generally used to determine the enterprise value of the issuer of a credit investment, and considers valuation multiples of comparable companies or transactions. The resulting enterprise value will dictate whether or not such credit investment has adequate enterprise value coverage. In cases of distressed credit instruments, the market approach may be used to estimate a recovery value in the event of a restructuring. 

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and notes payable within Loans Payable for the amounts due to unaffiliated third parties. Changes in the fair value of consolidated CLO assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income are presented within Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities. Expenses of consolidated CLO vehicles are presented in Fund Expenses. 

 Blackstone has elected the fair value option for certain proprietary investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The fair value of such investments is based on quoted prices in an active market, quoted prices that are published on a regular basis and are the basis for current transactions or using the discounted cash flow method. Changes in fair value are recognized in Investment Income (Loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

 Further disclosure on instruments for which the fair value option has been elected is presented in Note 7. Fair Value Option. 

 Blackstone may elect to measure certain proprietary investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values under the measurement alternative, which reflects cost less impairment, with adjustments in value resulting from observable price changes arising from orderly transactions of the same or a similar security from the same issuer. If the measurement alternative election is not made, the equity security is measured at fair value. The measurement alternative election is made on an instrument by instrument basis. The election is reassessed each reporting period to determine whether investments under the measurement alternative have readily determinable fair values, in which case they would no longer be eligible for this election. 

The investments of consolidated Blackstone funds in funds of hedge funds Investee Funds are valued at net asset value NAV per share of the Investee Fund. In limited circumstances, Blackstone may determine, based on its own due diligence and investment procedures, that NAV per share does not represent fair value. In such circumstances, Blackstone will estimate the fair value in good faith and in a manner that it reasonably chooses, in accordance with the requirements of GAAP. 

Certain investments of Blackstone and of the consolidated Blackstone funds of hedge funds and credit-focused funds measure their investments in underlying funds at fair value using NAV per share without adjustment. The terms of the investee s investment generally provide for minimum holding periods or lock-ups, the institution of gates on redemptions or the suspension of redemptions or an ability to side pocket investments, at the discretion of the investee s fund manager, and as a result, investments may not be redeemable at, or within three months of, the reporting date. A side-pocket is used by hedge funds and funds of hedge funds to separate investments that may lack a readily ascertainable value, are illiquid or are subject to liquidity restriction. Redemptions are generally not permitted until the investments within a side-pocket are liquidated or it is deemed that the conditions existing at the time that required the investment to be included in the side-pocket no longer exist. As the timing of either of these events is uncertain, the timing at which Blackstone may redeem an investment held in a side-pocket cannot be estimated. Further disclosure on instruments for which fair value is measured using NAV per share is presented in Note 5. Net Asset Value as Fair Value. 

 Security and loan transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. 

In cases where Blackstone s equity method investments provide for a disproportionate allocation of the profits and losses (as is the case with funds that include a Performance Allocation), Blackstone s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period, Blackstone calculates the Accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as Accrued Performance Allocations to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner, or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to Blackstone to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, resulting in a negative adjustment to the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner. In each scenario, it is necessary to calculate the Accrued Performance Allocation on cumulative results compared to the Accrued Performance Allocation recorded to date and make the required positive or negative adjustments. Blackstone ceases to record negative Performance Allocations once previously Accrued Performance Allocations for such fund have been fully reversed. Blackstone is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles, and therefore, cannot have negative Performance Allocations over the life of a fund. The carrying amounts of equity method investments are reflected in Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

 Strategic Partners results presented in Blackstone s condensed consolidated financial statements are reported on a three-month lag from Strategic Partners fund financial statements, which report the performance of underlying investments generally on a same quarter basis, if available. Therefore, Strategic Partners results presented herein do not reflect the impact of economic and market activity in the current quarter. Current quarter market activity of Strategic Partners underlying investments is expected to affect Blackstone s reported results in upcoming periods. 

Deferred Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets are separately stated, and deferred tax liabilities are included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

 Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

Blackstone recognizes tax positions in the condensed consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in the return and amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported on the related liability line in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Blackstone takes possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and is permitted to repledge, deliver or otherwise use such securities. Blackstone also pledges its financial instruments to counterparties to collateralize repurchase agreements. Financial instruments pledged that can be repledged, delivered or otherwise used by the counterparty are recorded in Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Additional disclosures relating to repurchase agreements are included in Note 10. Repurchase Agreements. 

 Blackstone does not offset assets and liabilities relating to reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Additional disclosures relating to offsetting are discussed in Note 11. Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities. 

Accumulated Amortization

Intangible Assets, Net

Amortization expense associated with Blackstone s intangible assets was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

 Amortization of Intangible Assets held at September 30, 2024 is expected to be million, million, million, million, and million for each of the years ending December 31, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively. Blackstone s Intangible Assets as of September 30, 2024 are expected to amortize over a weighted-average period of years.

Blackstone holds variable interests in certain VIEs which are not consolidated as it is determined that Blackstone is not the primary beneficiary. Blackstone s involvement with such entities is in the form of direct and indirect equity interests and fee arrangements. The maximum exposure to loss represents the loss of assets recognized by Blackstone relating to non-consolidated VIEs and any clawback obligation relating to previously distributed Performance Allocations.

Notional Pooling Arrangements 

Blackstone has notional cash pooling arrangements with financial institutions for cash management purposes. These arrangements allow for cash withdrawals based upon aggregate cash balances on deposit at the same financial institution. Cash withdrawals cannot exceed aggregate cash balances on deposit. The net balance of cash on deposit and overdrafts is used as a basis for calculating net interest expense or income. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate cash balance on deposit relating to the cash pooling arrangements was million, which was offset and reported net of the accompanying overdraft of million.

 In computing the dilutive effect that the exchange of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units would have on Net Income Per Share of Common Stock, Blackstone considered that net income available to holders of shares of common stock would increase due to the elimination of non-controlling interests in Blackstone Holdings, inclusive of any tax impact. The hypothetical conversion may be dilutive to the extent there is activity at the Blackstone Inc. level that has not previously been attributed to the non-controlling interests or if there is a change in tax rate as a result of a hypothetical conversion. 

Share Repurchase Program 

On July 16, 2024, Blackstone s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. This authorization replaced Blackstone s prior billion repurchase authorization. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual numbers repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. 

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Blackstone repurchased million and million shares of common stock at a total cost of million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Blackstone repurchased million and million shares of common stock at a total cost of million and million, respectively.

Interests of the Founder, Senior Managing Directors, Employees and Other Related Parties 

The Founder, senior managing directors, employees and certain other related parties invest on a discretionary basis in the consolidated Blackstone Funds both directly and through consolidated entities. These investments generally are subject to preferential management fee and performance allocation or incentive fee arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, such investments aggregated billion and billion, respectively. Their share of the Net Income Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling and Non-Controlling
 Interests in Consolidated Entities aggregated to million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 Contingent Repayment Guarantee 

Blackstone and its personnel who have received Performance Allocation distributions have guaranteed payment on a several basis (subject to a cap) to the carry funds of any clawback obligation with respect to the excess Performance Allocation allocated to the general partners of such funds and indirectly received thereby to the extent that either Blackstone or its personnel fails to fulfill its clawback obligation, if any. The Accrual for Potential Repayment of Previously Received Performance Allocations represents amounts previously paid to Blackstone Holdings and non-controlling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the Blackstone Funds if the carry funds were to be liquidated based on the fair value of their underlying investments as of September 30, 2024. See Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Contingent Obligations (Clawback). 

Tax Receivable Agreements 

Blackstone used a portion of the proceeds from the IPO and other sales of shares to purchase interests in the predecessor businesses from the predecessor owners. In addition, holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units may exchange their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units for shares of Blackstone common stock on a one-for-one basis. The purchase and subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Blackstone would otherwise be required to pay in the future. 

 Blackstone has entered into tax receivable agreements with each of the predecessor owners and additional tax receivable agreements have been executed, and will continue to be executed, with senior managing directors and others who acquire Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The agreements provide for the payment by the corporate taxpayer to such owners of of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the corporate taxpayers actually realize as a result of the aforementioned increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into these tax receivable agreements. For purposes of the tax receivable agreements, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the corporate taxpayers to the amount of such taxes that the corporate taxpayers would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings as a result of the exchanges and had the corporate taxpayers not entered into the tax receivable agreements. 

 Assuming no future material changes in the relevant tax law and that the corporate taxpayers earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization of the assets, the expected future payments under the tax receivable agreements (which are taxable to the recipients) will aggregate billion over the next years. The after-tax net present value of these estimated payments totals million assuming a discount rate and using Blackstone s most recent projections relating to the estimated timing of the benefit to be received. Future payments under the tax receivable agreements in respect of subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. The payments under the tax receivable agreements are not conditioned upon continued ownership of Blackstone equity interests by the pre-IPO owners and the others mentioned above. 

 Amounts related to the deferred tax asset resulting from the increase in tax basis from the exchange of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of Blackstone common stock, the resulting remeasurement of net deferred tax assets at the Blackstone ownership percentage at the balance sheet date, the due to affiliates for the future payments resulting from the tax receivable agreements and resulting adjustment to partners capital are included as Acquisition of Ownership Interests from Non-Controlling Interest Holders in the Supplemental Disclosure of Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

billion of investment commitments as of September 30, 2024 representing general partner capital funding commitments to the Blackstone Funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and Blackstone principal investment commitments, including loan commitments. The consolidated Blackstone f
unds had signed investment commitments of million as of September 30, 2024, which includes million of signed investment commitments for portfolio company acquisitions in the process of closing. 

 Contingencies 

Guarantees 

Certain of Blackstone s consolidated real estate funds guarantee payments to third parties in connection with the ongoing business activities and/or acquisitions of their Portfolio Companies. There is no direct recourse to Blackstone to fulfill such obligations. To the extent that underlying funds are required to fulfill guarantee obligations, Blackstone s invested capital in such funds is at risk. Total investments at risk in respect of guarantees extended by consolidated real estate funds was million as of September 30, 2024. 

 The Blackstone Holdings Partnerships provided guarantees to a lending institution for certain loans held by employees either for investment in Blackstone Funds or for members capital contributions to Blackstone Europe LLP. The amount guaranteed as of September 30, 2024 was million. 

 Strategic Ventures 

In December 2022 and January 2023, Blackstone entered into long-term strategic ventures UC strategic ventures with the Regents of the University of California UC Investments ), an institutional investor that subscribed for billion of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. BREIT Class I shares during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The UC strategic ventures provide a waterfall structure with UC Investments receiving an target annualized net return on its billion investment in BREIT shares and upside from its investment. This target return, while not guaranteed, is supported by a pledge by Blackstone of billion of its holdings in BREIT as of the subscription dates, including any appreciation or dividends received by Blackstone in respect thereof. Pursuant to the UC strategic ventures, Blackstone is entitled to receive an incremental cash payment from UC Investments on any returns received in excess of the target return. An asset or liability is recognized based on fair value with the maximum potential future obligation capped at the fair value of the assets pledged by Blackstone in connection with the above arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the assets pledged was billion and the total liability recognized was million. 

 Litigation 

Blackstone may from time to time be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of its business. Blackstone s businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against Blackstone. 

 Blackstone accrues a liability for legal proceedings only when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such legal actions, based on information known by management, Blackstone does not have any unaccrued liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In December 2017, eight pension plan members of the Kentucky Retirement System KRS filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of KRS in the Franklin County Circuit Court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (the Mayberry Action ). Plaintiffs alleged various breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of Kentucky state law in connection with KRS s investment in three hedge funds of funds, including a fund managed by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P. BLP ). The suit named more than 30 defendants, including, among others, The Blackstone Group L.P. (now Blackstone Inc.); BLP; Stephen A. Schwarzman, as Chairman and CEO of Blackstone; and J. Tomilson Hill, as then-CEO of BLP (collectively, the Blackstone Defendants ). In July 2020, the Kentucky Supreme Court directed the Circuit Court to dismiss the action due to the plaintiffs lack of standing. 

 Over the objection of the Blackstone Defendants and others, in December 2020, the Circuit Court permitted the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (the AG to intervene in the Mayberry Action. In April 2023, the Kentucky Court of Appeals held that the Circuit Court exceeded its authority in permitting the AG s intervention in the Mayberry Action, and vacated all orders other than the order dismissing the original derivative complaint in the Mayberry Action. 

 Around the time the AG moved to intervene, the AG separately filed an additional back-up complaint asserting substantially identical claims against largely the same defendants as the Mayberry Action (the July 2020 Action ). The AG filed amended complaints in August 2023 and November 2023. Defendants moved to dismiss. 

 In April 2024, while the motions to dismiss the AG s second amended complaint were pending, the AG amended its complaint for the third time, adding a breach of contract claim against the Blackstone Defendants. Also in April 2024, as a technicality the AG instituted a technical action asserting substantively the same claims against the same defendants for the stated purpose of satisfying a limitations statute (the April 2024 Action ). In May 2024, the Court consolidated the July 2020 Action and the April 2024 Action, and denied the Blackstone Defendants motion to dismiss the AG s second amended complaint in the July 2020 Action, along with most other defendants motions to dismiss. On June 17, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the AG s third amended complaint in the now-consolidated actions. Briefing on the motions to dismiss is ongoing. 

 In August 2022, KRS was ordered to disclose, and in September 2022, did disclose, a report prepared in 2021 by a law firm retained by KRS to conduct an investigation into the investment activities underlying the lawsuit. According to the report, the investigators did not find any violations of fiduciary duty or illegal activity by [BLP] related to KRS s due diligence and retention of BLP or KRS s continued investment with BLP. The report quotes contemporaneous communications by KRS staff during the period of the investment recognizing that BLP was exceeding KRS s returns benchmark, that BLP was providing KRS with far fewer negative months than any liquid market comparable, and that BLP [h]as killed it. 

 In January 2021, certain former plaintiffs in the Mayberry Action filed a separate action Taylor I against the Blackstone Defendants and other defendants named in the Mayberry Action, asserting allegations substantially similar to those in the Mayberry Action, and in July 2021 they amended their complaint to add class action allegations. Defendants removed Taylor I to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, and in March 2022, the District Court stayed Taylor I pending the resolution of the AG s suit. 

 In August 2021, a group of KRS members including those that filed Taylor I filed a new action in Franklin County Circuit Court Taylor II ), against the Blackstone Defendants, other defendants named in the Mayberry Action, and other KRS officials. The filed complaint is substantially similar to that filed in Taylor I and the Mayberry Action. In July 2022, most defendants (including the Blackstone Defendants) moved to dismiss, which the Court denied in May 2024. These defendants subsequently filed appeals in the Court of Appeals, including a cross-appeal filed by the Blackstone Defendants, which is currently pending. In July 2024, the Blackstone Defendants and the other fund manager defendants filed a petition for a writ of prohibition, which is also pending. In July 2024, the Court stayed the action pending resolution of the writ of prohibition. 

In April 2021, the AG filed an action (the Declaratory Judgment Action against BLP and the other fund manager defendants from the Mayberry Action in Franklin County Circuit Court. The action sought to have certain provisions in the subscription agreements between KRS and the fund managers declared to be in violation of the Kentucky Constitution. In March 2022, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment to the AG and the Court of Appeals affirmed in December 2023. On August 14, 2024, the Kentucky Supreme Court granted BLP s motion for discretionary review. 

 Blackstone continues to believe that the preceding lawsuits against Blackstone are totally without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. 

 In July 2021, BLP filed a breach of contract action against defendants affiliated with KRS alleging that the Mayberry Action and the Declaratory Judgment Action breach the parties subscription agreements governing KRS s investment with BLP. The action seeks damages, including legal fees and expenses incurred in defending against the above actions. In April 2022, the Circuit Court dismissed BLP s complaint without prejudice to refiling, on the grounds that the action was not yet ripe for adjudication. The Court of Appeals affirmed that decision in May 2023. In February 2024, the Kentucky Supreme Court granted BLP s motion for discretionary review. The appeal is fully briefed and pending. 

In October 2022, as part of a sweep of private equity and other investment advisory firms, the SEC sent us a request for information relating to the retention of certain types of electronic business communications, including text messages, that may be required to be preserved under certain SEC rules. We are continuing to cooperate with the SEC and are discussing a potential resolution of this inquiry. Our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include an accrual for the estimated liability related to this matter. 

Contingent Obligations (Clawback) 

Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund s life except for certain Blackstone funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. The lives of the carry funds, including available contemplated extensions, for which a liability for potential clawback obligations has been recorded for financial reporting purposes, are currently anticipated to expire at various points through . Further extensions of such terms may be implemented under given circumstances. 

 For financial reporting purposes, when applicable, the general partners record a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners of some of the carry funds due to changes in the unrealized value of a fund s remaining investments and where the fund s general partner has previously received Performance Allocation distributions with respect to such fund s realized investments. 

Private Equity

Credit Insurance

(a)
 
 The split of clawback between Blackstone Holdings and Current and Former Personnel is based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis. 

(b)
 
 Total is a component of Due to Affiliates. See Note 16. Related Party Transactions Affiliate Receivables and Payables Due to Affiliates. 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Blackstone general partners paid an interim cash clawback obligation of million related to a Private Equity segment fund, of which million was paid by Blackstone Holdings and million by current and former Blackstone personnel. 

 For Private Equity, Real Estate, and certain Credit Insurance Funds, a portion of the Performance Allocations paid to current and former Blackstone personnel is held in segregated accounts in the event of a cash clawback obligation. These segregated accounts are not included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Blackstone, except to the extent a portion of the assets held in the segregated accounts may be allocated to a consolidated Blackstone fund of hedge funds. At September 30, 2024, billion was held in segregated accounts for the purpose of meeting any clawback obligations of current and former personnel if such payments are required. 

 In the Credit Insurance segment, payment of Performance Allocations to Blackstone by the majority of the stressed/distressed, mezzanine and credit alpha strategies funds are substantially deferred under the terms of the partnership agreements. This deferral mitigates the need to hold funds in segregated accounts in the event of a cash clawback obligation. 

 If, at September 30, 2024, all of the investments held by Blackstone s carry funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of Performance Allocations subject to potential clawback would be billion, on an after-tax
 basis where applicable, of which Blackstone Holdings is potentially liable for billion if current and former Blackstone personnel default on their share of the liability, a possibility that management also views as remote. 

Credit Insurance Blackstone s Credit Insurance segment consists principally of Blackstone Credit Insurance, which is organized into three overarching strategies: private corporate credit, liquid corporate credit and infrastructure and asset based credit. In addition, the segment includes an insurer-focused platform. 

Multi-Asset Investing Multi-Asset Investing is organized into two primary platforms: Absolute Return and Multi-Strategy. In addition, the segment also includes a publicly traded energy infrastructure, renewables and master limited partnership investment platform. 

 These business segments are differentiated by their various investment strategies. Each of the segments primarily earns its income from management fees and investment returns on assets under management. 

 Segment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone s four segments. 

Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in Blackstone s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone s operational performance. 

For segment reporting purposes, Segment Distributable Earnings is presented along with its major components, Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations. Fee Related Earnings is used to assess Blackstone s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Net Realizations is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues less Realized Performance Compensation. Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees are presented together and referred to collectively as Performance Revenues or Performance Compensation. 

 Effective for the three months ended June 30, 2024, GP Stakes is included in Blackstone s Private Equity segment and Harvest is included in Blackstone s Multi-Asset Investing segment. Previously, GP Stakes and Harvest were included in Blackstone s Multi-Asset Investing and Credit Insurance segments, respectively. All prior periods have been recast to reflect this reclassification.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Blackstone Inc. s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In this report, references to Blackstone, the Company, we, us or our refer to Blackstone Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

 Our Business 

Blackstone is the world s largest alternative asset manager. We generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. We also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a pro-rata share of the income of the fund (a pro-rata allocation ). In addition to a pro-rata allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest Performance Allocations ). In certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment fund based on achieving certain investment returns (an Incentive Fee, and together with Performance Allocations, Performance Revenues ). The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. Net investment gains and investment income generated by the Blackstone Funds are driven by the performance of the underlying investments as well as overall market conditions. Fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio companies and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions. 

 Our business is organized into four segments: 

 Real Estate 

Our Real Estate business is a global leader in real estate investing. Our Real Estate segment operates as one globally integrated business, with investments across the globe, including in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our real estate investment teams seek to utilize our global expertise and presence to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors. 

69 

Table of Contents 

 Our Blackstone Real Estate Partners BREP business is geographically diversified and targets a broad range of opportunistic real estate and real estate-related investments. The BREP platform includes global funds as well as funds focused specifically on Europe or Asia investments. BREP seeks to invest thematically in high-quality assets, focusing where we see outsized growth potential driven by global economic and demographic trends. BREP has made significant investments in logistics, data centers, rental housing, hospitality, office and retail properties around the world, as well as in a variety of real estate operating companies. 

 Our Core+ real estate strategy invests in substantially stabilized real estate globally primarily through perpetual capital vehicles. Our Core+ real estate strategy includes our (a) Blackstone Property Partners BPP funds, which focus on high-quality assets in the Americas, Europe and Asia and (b) our non-listed REIT, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. BREIT and our Blackstone European Property Income BEPIF vehicles, which provide income-focused individual investors access to institutional quality real estate primarily in the Americas and Europe, respectively. 

 Our Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies BREDS platform primarily targets real estate-related debt investment opportunities. BREDS invests in both public and private markets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. BREDS scale and investment mandates enable it to provide a variety of lending options for our borrowers and investment options for our investors, including commercial real estate and mezzanine loans and liquid real estate-related debt securities. The BREDS platform includes high-yield real estate debt funds, liquid real estate debt funds, capital managed on behalf of our Credit Insurance segment s insurance platform and Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. BXMT ), a NYSE-listed REIT. 

 Effective the third quarter of 2024, the residential debt business was transferred from Real Estate to Credit Insurance to align with a change in Blackstone s management of those businesses. This organizational change resulted in a decrease (reflected as an outflow) for September 30, 2024 to Real Estate Total and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management and an increase (reflected as a contra-outflow) to Credit Insurance Total and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management (the Residential Debt Transfer ). These changes do not impact Blackstone s Total or Fee-Earning Assets Under Management or outflows in total. 

 Private Equity 

Our Private Equity segment includes our Corporate Private Equity business, which consists of: (a) our global private equity funds, Blackstone Capital Partners BCP ), (b) our sector-focused funds, including our energy- and energy transition-focused funds, Blackstone Energy Transition Partners BETP ), (c) our Asia-focused private equity funds, Blackstone Capital Partners Asia and (d) our core private equity funds, Blackstone Core Equity Partners BCEP ). Our Private Equity segment also includes (a) our opportunistic investment platform that invests flexibly across asset classes, industries and geographies, Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Tactical Opportunities ), (b) our secondary funds business, Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Strategic Partners ), and our business that targets minority investments in the general partners of private equity and other private market alternative asset management firms GP Stakes as Secondaries, (c) our infrastructure-focused funds, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners BIP ), including vehicles primarily focused in the U.S. BIP U.S. and in Europe BIP Europe ), (d) our life sciences investment platform, Blackstone Life Sciences BXLS ), (e) our growth equity investment platform, Blackstone Growth BXG ), (f) our investment platform offering eligible individual investors access to Blackstone s private equity capabilities, the Blackstone Private Equity Strategies Fund Program BXPE ), (g) our multi-asset investment program for eligible high net worth investors offering exposure to certain of Blackstone s key illiquid investment strategies through a single commitment, Blackstone Total Alternatives Solution BTAS and (h) our capital markets services business, Blackstone Capital Markets BXCM ).

We are a global leader in private equity investing. Our Corporate Private Equity business pursues transactions across industries on a global basis. It strives to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation. Corporate Private Equity s investment strategies and core themes continually evolve in anticipation of, or in response to, changes in the global economy, local markets, regulation, capital flows and geopolitical trends. We seek to construct a differentiated portfolio of investments with a well-defined, post-acquisition value creation strategy. Similarly, we seek investments that can generate strong unlevered returns regardless of entry or exit cycle timing. 

 BCEP pursues control-oriented investments in high-quality companies with durable businesses and seeks to offer a lower level of risk and a longer hold period than traditional private equity. 

 Tactical Opportunities pursues a thematically driven, opportunistic investment strategy. Our flexible, global mandate enables us to find differentiated opportunities across asset classes, industries and geographies and invest behind them with the frequent use of structure to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Tactical Opportunities ability to dynamically shift focus to the most compelling opportunities in any market environment, combined with the business expertise in structuring complex transactions, enables Tactical Opportunities to invest in attractive market areas, often with securities that provide downside protection and maintain upside return. 

 Secondaries is comprised of our Strategic Partners and GP Stakes businesses. Strategic Partners is a total fund solutions provider. As a secondary investor, it acquires interests in high-quality private funds from original holders seeking liquidity. Strategic Partners focuses on a range of opportunities in underlying funds such as private equity, real estate, infrastructure, venture and growth capital, credit and other types of funds, as well as general partner-led transactions and primary investments and co-investments with financial sponsors. Strategic Partners also provides investment advisory services to separately managed account clients investing in primary and secondary investments in private funds and co-investments. Effective the second quarter of 2024, our GP Stakes business moved from our Multi-Asset Investment segment to our Private Equity segment. GP Stakes targets minority investments in the general partners of private equity and other private market alternative asset management firms globally, with a focus on delivering a combination of recurring annual cash flow yield and long-term capital appreciation. 

BIP targets a diversified mix of core+, core and public-private partnership investments across all infrastructure sectors, including energy infrastructure, transportation, digital infrastructure and water and waste. BIP applies a disciplined, operationally intensive investment approach to investments, seeking to apply a long-term buy-and-hold strategy to large-scale infrastructure assets with a focus on delivering stable, long-term capital appreciation together with a predictable annual cash flow yield. 

BXLS invests across the life cycle of companies and products within the life sciences sector. BXLS primarily focuses on investments in life sciences products in late-stage clinical development within the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical technology sectors. 

 BXG seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in dynamic, growth-stage businesses, with a focus on the consumer, consumer technology, enterprise solutions, financial services and healthcare sectors. 

 BXPE invests primarily in privately negotiated, equity-oriented investments, leveraging the talent and investment capabilities of Blackstone s private equity platform to create an attractive portfolio of alternative investments diversified across geographies and sectors for eligible individual investors. 

 Credit Insurance 

Effective January 1, 2024, our corporate credit (formerly Blackstone Credit or BXC), asset based finance and insurance insurance platform and formerly Blackstone Insurance Solutions or BIS) groups were integrated into a single new unit, Blackstone Credit Insurance BXCI ). BXCI offers its clients and borrowers a comprehensive solution across corporate and asset based, as well as investment grade and non-investment grade, private credit. BXCI is one of the largest credit-oriented managers and CLO managers in the world. The investment portfolios of the funds BXCI s credit platform manages or sub-advises consist primarily of loans and securities of non-investment and investment grade companies spread across the capital structure including senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock and common equity. 

71 

Table of Contents 

 BXCI is organized into three overarching credit investing strategies: private corporate credit, liquid corporate credit and infrastructure and asset based credit. The private corporate credit strategies include mezzanine and direct lending funds and stressed/distressed strategies. The direct lending funds include Blackstone Private Credit Fund BCRED and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund BXSL ), both of which are business development companies BDCs ). The liquid corporate credit strategies consist of CLOs, closed-ended funds, open-ended funds, systematic strategies and separately managed accounts. The infrastructure and asset based credit strategies include our private placement strategies, energy strategies (including the sustainable resources platform) and asset based finance strategies focused on privately originated, income-oriented credit assets secured by physical, financial or residential real estate collateral. 

 Our insurance platform focuses on providing full investment management services for insurers general accounts, seeking to deliver customized and diversified portfolios that include allocations to Blackstone managed products and strategies across asset classes and Blackstone s private credit origination capabilities. Through this platform, we provide our clients tailored portfolio construction and strategic asset allocation, seeking to generate risk-managed, capital-efficient returns, diversification and capital preservation that meets clients objectives. We also provide similar services to clients through separately managed accounts or by sub-managing assets for certain insurance-dedicated funds and special purpose vehicles. Through the insurance platform, we currently manage assets for clients that include Corebridge Financial Inc., Everlake Life Insurance Company, Fidelity Guaranty Life Insurance Company and Resolution Life Group, among others. 

 Multi-Asset Investing 

Effective the first quarter of 2024, our Hedge Fund Solutions segment was renamed Multi-Asset Investing. Our Multi-Asset Investing segment seeks to grow investors assets through investment strategies designed to deliver, primarily through the public markets, compelling risk-adjusted returns. Blackstone Multi-Asset Investing BXMA is the world s largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds. BXMA is organized into two primary platforms: Absolute Return and Multi-Strategy. Absolute Return is designed to pursue consistent, efficient and diversifying returns across multiple market environments. Absolute Return manages a broad range of commingled and customized fund solutions, a seeding business and registered funds that provide alternative asset solutions through daily liquidity products. Multi-Strategy aims to generate strong risk-adjusted returns through opportunistic, asset-class agnostic investing, including structured risk transfer and equity capital markets strategies. Effective the second quarter of 2024, our Multi-Asset Investing segment also includes a platform managed by Harvest Fund Advisors LLC Harvest ), which was previously part of the Credit Insurance segment. Harvest primarily invests in publicly traded energy infrastructure, renewables and master limited partnerships holding midstream energy assets in North America. 

 Business Environment 

Blackstone s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world. 

Most major equity markets appreciated in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting continued resilience of the global economy and improving investor sentiment following central banks interest rate reductions. The total return of the S P 500 index was 5.9 , led by utilities and real estate, which increased 19.4 and 17.2 , respectively. The energy sector decreased 2.3 on lower energy prices, with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil down 16 to 68.17 per barrel. Equity market volatility increased, with the CBOE Volatility Index up 34.5 . Credit markets appreciated as well, with the S P leveraged loan index up 2.1 and the Credit Suisse high yield bond index up 4.8 . High yield spreads tightened by 7 basis points sequentially, while issuance increased 95 year-over-year. 

72 

Table of Contents 

In the U.S., inflation continued to decelerate in the third quarter, with September CPI of 2.4 down sharply from the prior peak of 9.1 in June 2022 and down from 3.0 in June 2024. For the first time since March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target range by 50 basis points in September to 4.75-5.00 in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks. The Federal Reserve has stated it is not on a preset course for reductions, but has indicated that additional, smaller cuts this year are likely if economic data remains consistent. The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield decreased 61 basis points to 3.78 but subsequently increased to 4.28 as of October 28, 2024. Meanwhile, short-term yields moved lower, with three-month SOFR down 37 basis points to 4.96 and further declined to 4.82 as of October 28, 2024.

The advance estimate of U.S. annualized GDP growth for the third quarter was 2.8 , demonstrating continued resilience of the U.S. economy. Wages increased 4.0 year-over-year in September 2024, while re tail
 sales rose 1.7 year-over-year. In manufacturing, the ISM Manufacturing PMI decreased from 48.5 to 47.2 quarter over quarter. Following a strong September jobs report that exceeded economists expectations, job creation stalled in October 2024 amid weather disruptions and labor strikes. The unemployment rate, however, remained relatively steady at 4.1 . 

Outside of the U.S., many central banks have been loosening monetary policy. The European Central Bank lowered its deposit facility rate by 25 basis points in the third quarter to 3.50 and an additional 25 basis points to 3.25 in October, its first consecutive reduction since 2011. Eurozone inflation slowed to 1.7 year-over-year in September 2024, down from a peak of 10.6 in October 2022 and from 2.5 in June 2024. The Bank of England also lowered its bank rate by 25 basis points in the third quarter to 5.0 , as U.K. inflation slowed to 1.7 year-over-year in September 2024 down from a peak of 11.1 and 2.0 in October 2022 and June 2024, respectively. By contrast, the Bank of Japan further increased its policy rate to 0.25 in July following its first increase in 17 years in March 2024. 

 Capital markets activity levels in the U.S. improved on a year-to-date basis but remained at historically lower levels. While rising 68 year-over-year, U.S. initial public offering volumes year to date remained 87 below the comparable period in 2021. U.S. announced merger and acquisition deal volumes year to date similarly increased 17 year-over-year but remained 42 below the comparable period in 2021. 

 Amid moderating inflation, declining cost of capital and a healthy labor market, many economic analysts forecast a soft-landing for the U.S. economy. While this should support global economic growth over time, the outlook remains uncertain given continued geopolitical turbulence, including ongoing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, concern over whether China s stimulus measures will effectively stabilize slowing economic growth in the country, and upcoming elections. In the U.S., the Presidential election creates the potential for governmental policy and regulatory changes in a variety of areas, which could impact such economic outlook.

The simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held. 

Key Financial Measures and Indicators 

We manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). See Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Policies. Our key non-GAAP financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below. 

 Distributable Earnings 

Distributable Earnings is derived from Blackstone s segment reported results. Distributable Earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to Blackstone stockholders, including Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. Distributable Earnings is the sum of Segment Distributable Earnings plus Net Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) less Taxes and Related Payables. Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our reconciliation of Distributable Earnings.

Net Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to Interest and Dividend Revenue less Interest Expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of Blackstone Funds, and interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement. 

 Taxes and Related Payables represent the total GAAP tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and including the payable under the tax receivable agreement. Further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating Taxes and Related Payables and Distributable Earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of Segment Distributable Earnings and Total Segment Distributable Earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items where there is a current tax provision or benefit. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for Blackstone s Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. Management believes that including the amount payable under the tax receivable agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating Distributable Earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to stockholders. 

 Segment Distributable Earnings 

Segment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone s four segments. Blackstone believes it is useful to stockholders to review the measure that management uses in assessing segment performance. Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in Blackstone s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone s operational performance. Segment Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our reconciliation of Segment Distributable Earnings. 

 Net Realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues (which refers to Realized Performance Revenues excluding Fee Related Performance Revenues), less Realized Performance Compensation (which refers to Realized Performance Compensation excluding Fee Related Performance Compensation and Equity-Based Performance Compensation). 

 Realized Performance Compensation reflects an increase in the aggregate Realized Performance Compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them. The expectation is that for the full year 2024, Fee Related Compensation will be decreased by the total amount of additional Performance Compensation awarded for the year. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Realized Performance Compensation increased by 21.6 million and 77.6 million, respectively, and Fee Related Compensation decreased by 21.3 million and 63.8 million, respectively. These changes to Realized Performance Compensation and Fee Related Compensation reduced Net Realizations, increased Fee Related Earnings and had a

negative impact to Income Before Provision for Taxes and Distributable Earnings in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These changes are not expected to impact Income Before Provision for Taxes and Distributable Earnings for the year ending December 31, 2024. Changes to Realized Performance Compensation and Fee Related Compensation had an impact on individual quarters in 2023 but did not impact Income Before Provision for Taxes and Distributable Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Effective during the three months ended June 30, 2024, GP Stakes is included in our Private Equity segment and Harvest is included in our Multi-Asset Investing segment. Previously, GP Stakes and Harvest were included in our Multi-Asset Investing and Credit Insurance segments, respectively. All prior periods have been recast to reflect this reclassification. 

Fee Related Earnings 

Fee Related Earnings is a performance measure used to assess Blackstone s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Blackstone believes Fee Related Earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the profitability of the portion of Blackstone s business that is not dependent on realization activity. Fee Related Earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (a) Fee Related Compensation on a segment basis and (b) Other Operating Expenses. Fee Related Earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our reconciliation of Fee Related Earnings. 

 Fee Related Compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding Equity-Based Compensation, directly related to (a) Management and Advisory Fees, Net and (b) Fee Related Performance Revenues, referred to as Fee Related Performance Compensation. 

 Fee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Performance Revenues from Perpetual Capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. 

 Other Operating Expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to General, Administrative and Other Expenses, adjusted to (a) remove transaction-related and non-recurring items that arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone s initial public offering, and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the Blackstone Funds which are netted against Management and Advisory Fees, Net in Blackstone s segment presentation and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone s segment presentation. 

 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization 

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA ), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from Blackstone s segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA represents Distributable Earnings plus the addition of (a) Interest Expense on a segment basis, (b) Taxes and Related Payables and (c) Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA.

 Net Accrued Performance Revenues 

Net Accrued Performance Revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure Blackstone believes is useful to stockholders as an indicator of potential future realized performance revenues based on the current investment portfolio of the funds and vehicles we manage. Net Accrued Performance Revenues represents the accrued performance revenues receivable by Blackstone, net of the related accrued performance compensation payable by Blackstone, excluding performance revenues that have been realized but not yet distributed as of the reporting date and clawback amounts, if any. Net Accrued Performance Revenues is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Investments. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our reconciliation of Net Accrued Performance Revenues and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Equity Method Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information on the calculation of Investments Accrued Performance Allocations. 

 Operating Metrics 

The alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. Since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies. 

 Total and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management 

Total Assets Under Management refers to the assets we manage. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it represents the total capital for which we provide investment management services. Our Total Assets Under Management equals the sum of: 

(a)
 
 the fair value of the investments held by our carry funds and our side-by-side and co-investment entities managed by us plus the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds and entities pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods, 

(b)
 
 the net asset value of (1) our hedge funds, real estate debt carry funds, BPP, certain co-investments managed by us, certain credit-focused funds and our Multi-Asset Investing drawdown funds (plus, in each case, the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds, including commitments yet to commence their investment periods) and (2) our funds of hedge funds, our Multi-Asset Investing registered investment companies, BREIT, BEPIF and BXPE, 

(c)
 
 the invested capital, fair value or net asset value of assets we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts, 

(d)
 
 the amount of debt and equity outstanding for our CLOs during the reinvestment period, 

(e)
 
 the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for our CLOs after the reinvestment period, 

(f)
 
 the gross or net amount of assets (including leverage where applicable) for our credit-focused registered investment companies and BDCs, 

(g)
 
 the fair value of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, term loans or similar instruments issued by BXMT and 

(h)
 
 borrowings under and any amounts available to be borrowed under certain credit facilities of our funds.

Table of Contents 

Our carry funds are commitment-based drawdown structured funds that do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, funds structured like hedge funds and other open-ended funds in our Real Estate, Credit Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments generally have structures that afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, Blackstone has the ability to fulfill redemption requests only (a) in Blackstone s or the vehicles board s discretion, as applicable, or (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital. Investment advisory agreements related to certain separately managed accounts in our Credit Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding separately managed accounts in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 30 to 95 days notice. Separately managed accounts in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone s right to cure. 

Fee-Earning Assets Under Management refers to the assets we manage on which we derive management fees and/or performance revenues. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital base upon which we can earn management fees and/or performance revenues. Our Fee-Earning Assets Under Management equals the sum of: 

(a)
 
 for our Private Equity segment funds, Real Estate segment carry funds including certain BREDS funds and certain Multi-Asset Investing funds, the amount of capital commitments, remaining invested capital, fair value, net asset value or par value of assets held, depending on the fee terms of the fund, 

(b)
 
 for our credit-focused carry funds, the amount of remaining invested capital (which may include leverage) or net asset value, depending on the fee terms of the fund, 

(c)
 
 the remaining invested capital or fair value of assets held in co-investment vehicles managed by us on which we receive fees, 

(d)
 
 the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, BPP, certain co-investments managed by us, certain registered investment companies, BREIT, BEPIF, BXPE and certain of our Multi-Asset Investing drawdown funds, 

(e)
 
 the invested capital, fair value of assets or the net asset value we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts, 

(f)
 
 the net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated distributable earnings of BXMT, subject to certain adjustments, 

(g)
 
 the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of our CLOs and 

(h)
 
 the gross amount of assets (including leverage) or the net assets for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies and BDCs. 

 Each of our segments may include certain Fee-Earning Assets Under Management on which we earn performance revenues but not management fees. 

 Our calculations of Total Assets Under Management and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. In addition, our calculation of Total Assets Under Management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from Blackstone and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to fees. Our definitions of Total Assets Under Management and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management are not based on any definition of Total Assets Under Management and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage. 

 For our carry funds, Total Assets Under Management includes the fair value of the investments held and uncalled capital commitments, whereas Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may include the total amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost depending on whether the investment period has expired or as specified by the fee terms of the fund. As such, in certain carry funds Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may be greater than Total Assets Under Management when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.

 Perpetual Capital 

Perpetual Capital refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows. Perpetual Capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it represents capital we manage that has a longer duration and the ability to generate recurring revenues in a different manner than traditional fund structures. 

 Dry Powder 

Dry Powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the extent to which capital is available for Blackstone to deploy capital into investment opportunities as they arise. 

 Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management 

Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management represents invested capital at fair value, including capital closed for funds whose investment period has not yet commenced, on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met. We believe Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital deployed that has the potential to generate performance revenues. 

 Consolidated Results of Operations 

Following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our four business segments (which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in Blackstone s consolidated operating partnerships and removes the amortization of intangibles assets and Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items) in these periods, see Segment Analysis below.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

Revenues were 3.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.1 billion, compared to 2.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of 1.1 billion in Investment Income (Loss), which was primarily due to an increase of 1.1 billion in Unrealized Investment Income (Loss). 

 The 1.1 billion increase in Unrealized Investment Income (Loss) was primarily attributable to higher unrealized appreciation of investments in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Principal drivers were: 

An increase of 834.6 million in our Private Equity segment, primarily attributable to higher unrealized appreciation of Blackstone s investment in certain Corporate Private Equity funds and GP Stakes funds in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Corporate Private Equity and GP Stakes funds appreciated 6.2 and 12.6 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 and 0.9 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

An increase of 310.9 million in our Real Estate segment, primarily attributable to lower unrealized depreciation of Blackstone s investment in certain BREP funds in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

 Expenses 

Expenses were 1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 521.2 million, compared to 1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 494.2 million in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which 454.4 million was an increase in Performance Allocations Compensation. The increase in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily due to an increase in Investment Income (Loss), on which a portion of compensation is based. 

 Other Income (Loss) 

Other Income (Loss) was 42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 91.9 million, compared to (49.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Other Income (Loss) was due to an increase of 91.9 million in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities. 

 The increase in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities was principally driven by increases of 81.5 million and 13.3 million in our Real Estate and Private Equity segments, respectively. The increase in our Real Estate segment was primarily driven by lower unrealized depreciation of investments in our consolidated funds. The increase in our Private Equity segment was primarily driven by higher unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds, partially offset by deconsolidation of a fund. 

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

Revenues were 10.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.4 billion, compared to 6.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of 3.1 billion in Investment Income (Loss), which was primarily composed of an increase of 3.1 billion in Unrealized Investment Income (Loss). 

81 

Table of Contents 

 The 3.1 billion increase in Unrealized Investment Income (Loss) was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net unrealized depreciation of investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Principal drivers were: 

An increase of 1.4 billion in our Private Equity segment, primarily attributable to higher unrealized appreciation of Blackstone s investment in certain BIP funds, certain Corporate Private Equity funds and GP Stakes funds in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. BIP, Corporate Private Equity and GP Stakes funds appreciated 16.8 , 11.7 and 24.7 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.4 , 8.6 and 1.1 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

An increase of 819.6 million in our Credit Insurance segment, primarily attributable to an unrealized gain on the ownership of Corebridge common stock based on the publicly traded price as of September 30, 2024, compared to an unrealized loss based on the publicly traded price as of September 30, 2023. 

An increase of 682.3 million in our Real Estate segment, primarily attributable to lower unrealized depreciation of Blackstone s investment in certain BREP and Core+ real estate funds in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

 Expenses 

Expenses were 5.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.3 billion, compared to 4.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 1.2 billion in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which 1.0 billion was an increase in Performance Allocations Compensation. The increase in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily due to the increase in Investment Income (Loss), on which a portion of compensation is based. 

 Other Income (Loss) 

Other Income (Loss) was 70.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 34.4 million, compared to 104.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Other Income (Loss) was principally due to a decrease of 32.5 million in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities. 

 The decrease in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities was driven by a decrease of 57.0 million in our Private Equity segment, partially offset by an increase of 27.3 million in our Real Estate segment. The decrease in our Private Equity segment was primarily due to the deconsolidation of a fund and the increase in our Real Estate segment was primarily due to lower unrealized depreciation of investments in our consolidated funds. 

 Provision for Taxes 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Blackstone s Provision for Taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 245.3 million, an increase of 48.7 million, compared to 196.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 13.6 and 17.6 , based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of 1.8 billion and 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 The decrease in Blackstone s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, relates primarily to the deferred tax impact of Blackstone s investment in its operating partnerships. 

82 

Table of Contents 

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Blackstone s Provision for Taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 789.2 million, an increase of 321.7 million, compared to 467.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.1 and 16.7 , based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of 4.9 billion and 2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 The decrease in Blackstone s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, relates primarily to the impact of Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities and the deferred tax impact of Blackstone s investment in its operating partnerships. 

 Blackstone had a corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as calculated pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act. Blackstone will continue to assess the overall impact to its Provision for Taxes upon the issuance of applicable additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department related to interpretations of CAMT. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there is no meaningful CAMT impact reflected in the Provision for Taxes given current year tax payments made under CAMT are permitted to be carried forward and used as credits in future years resulting in a deferred tax benefit. 

 Additional information regarding our income taxes can be found in Note 13. Income Taxes in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 

 Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities 

The Net Loss Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities and Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities is attributable to the consolidated Blackstone funds. The amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated Blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of Other Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities from the Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. 

Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings is derived from the Income Before Provision for Taxes at the Blackstone Holdings level, excluding the Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities and the percentage allocation of the income between Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings and Blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to Blackstone. 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and other limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 38.4 and 39.1 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 38.6 and 39.3 , respectively. The respective decreases of 0.7 and 0.7 were primarily due to the conversion of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock.

Fee-Earning Assets Under Management inflows in Corporate Private Equity exceed Total Assets Under Management inflows primarily due to the commencement of the investment period of BCP IX and BETP IV in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Fee-Earning Assets Under Management inflows are reported when a fund s investment period commences, whereas Total Assets Under Management activity is reported at each fund closing. 

 Total Assets Under Management realizations in our Private Equity segment generally represents the total proceeds and typically exceeds the Fee-Earning Assets Under Management realizations. Fee-Earning Assets Under Management generally represents only the invested capital. 

 Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in Corporate Private Equity is reported based on committed or remaining invested capital, whereas Total Assets Under Management is reported based on fair value and remaining available capital. Total Assets Under Management market activity therefore exceeds Fee-Earning Assets Under Management market activity. 

 Total Assets Under Management inflows in our Credit Insurance segment direct lending funds exceed the Fee-Earning Assets Under Management inflows because Total Assets Under Management inflows are reported at their gross value while, for certain funds, Fee-Earning Assets Under Management inflows are reported as net assets, which is the basis on which fees are charged.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Segment Distributable Earnings were 540.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 16.8 million, compared to 557.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to a decrease of 45.3 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by an increase of 28.5 million in Net Realizations. 

Our global opportunistic and Core+ real estate portfolios are concentrated in high-conviction sectors with favorable long-term fundamentals. These sectors, including digital infrastructure, logistics and rental housing, have continued to support performance in our Real Estate segment. In particular, our data center platform was the single largest driver of appreciation in our Real Estate business and the firm in the third quarter of 2024. More broadly, we believe our Real Estate segment is well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for digital infrastructure over time.

Table of Contents 

We believe a meaningful decline in the cost of capital has positioned commercial real estate for increasing values over time and improving investor sentiment toward the sector. Moreover, real estate values should further be supported by the material decrease in new construction in certain sectors, including logistics and rental housing, which will contribute to further constraints on future supply. Growth in certain markets and sectors with elevated near-term supply, including U.S. logistics and multifamily, has slowed, however, and may moderate further. Challenges from new supply and muted demand have also pressured life science office and have negatively impacted valuations of such assets. Weak fundamentals have also persisted in the traditional office market and more troubled assets are likely to emerge. While our NYSE-listed REIT, Blackstone Mortgage Trust BXMT ), is mostly focused in sectors with strong long-term fundamentals, its office exposure is higher than in our real estate equity business. Although this has posed challenges for the vehicle, its focus on senior loans has been an important factor in mitigating the adverse impact of the sector s dislocation. 

 In addition, liquidity in the private market has also improved meaningfully, providing the foundation for greater transaction activity in the future. Ahead of an anticipated market recovery, our Real Estate funds invested or committed 22.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024, approximately two-and-a-half times the same period in 2023. These positive signs have coincided with improving investor sentiment in the third quarter, reflected in an over 90 decline in BREIT repurchase requests in September 2024 relative to their peak in January 2023. We believe that flows in our perpetual capital strategies could benefit from continued improvement of the market environment. 

 Fee Related Earnings

The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to a decrease of 91.5 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by an increase of 33.8 million in Net Realizations. 

 Fee Related Earnings 

Fee Related Earnings were 1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 91.5 million, compared to 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Fee Related Earnings was attributable to a decrease of 76.9 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues and an increase of 53.7 million in Other Operating Expenses, partially offset by an increase of 28.6 million in Management Fees, Net.

 Management Fees, Net were 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 28.6 million, compared to 2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Transaction and Other Fees, Net, partially offset by a decrease in Base Management Fees. Transaction and Other Fees, Net increased 70.8 million primarily due to an increase in acquisition fees paid to the advisor of our BREP funds. Base Management Fees decreased 60.7 million primarily due to a decrease in Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in BREIT and BPP and co-investment. 

 Net Realizations 

Net Realizations were 105.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 33.8 million, compared to 71.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of 33.2 million in Realized Performance Revenues.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Segment Distributable Earnings were 423.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 51.5 million, compared to 475.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of 76.9 million in Net Realizations, partially offset by an increase of 25.4 million in Fee Related Earnings. 

Our Private Equity segment s performance in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by particular strength in our Corporate Private Equity, Infrastructure and Life Sciences strategies. Specifically, our data center platform was the single largest driver of appreciation in our Infrastructure business and the firm in the third quarter of 2024. We believe our Infrastructure business is well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for digital infrastructure over time. In Corporate Private Equity, our operating companies saw stable revenue growth and margin strength overall in the quarter. Declining interest rates and improved investor sentiment have created positive momentum in deployment and fundraising, including in our perpetual capital strategies. The debt and equity capital markets have also improved, providing the foundation for greater transaction activity in the future. 

Fee Related Earnings 

Fee Related Earnings were 293.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 25.4 million, compared to 267.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of 51.0 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, partially offset by increases of 16.6 million in Fee Related Compensation and 14.9 million in Other Operating Expenses. 

 Management and Advisory Fees, Net were 552.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 51.0 million, compared to 501.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increases in Base Management Fees and Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees increased 30.1 million primarily due to an increase in Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in BIP and BXPE, as well as the commencement of BCP IX and BETP IV s investment period. Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net increased 23.0 million primarily due to increased volume of deal activity in BXCM. 

 Fee Related Compensation was 169.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 16.6 million, compared to 152.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, on which a portion of Fee Related Compensation is based. 

 Other Operating Expenses were 96.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.9 million, compared to 81.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees, including placement fees, and occupancy costs.

Management and Advisory Fees, Net were 1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 61.6 million compared to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increases in Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net and Base Management Fees.

 Funds With Closed Investment Periods as of September 30, 2024 

The Corporate Private Equity funds have eleven funds with closed investment periods: BCP IV, BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I. As of September 30, 2024, BCP IV was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BCP V is comprised of two fund classes, the BCP V main fund and BCP V-AC fund. Within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BCEP I and BCP Asia I were above their respective carried interest thresholds. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds. 

 Tactical Opportunities funds have various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: BTOF-POOL, BTOF-POOL II, and BTOF-POOL III, which are each above their carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Blackstone Growth funds have no funds with closed investment periods. Secondaries funds have various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: Strategic Partners Infrastructure III, Strategic Partners VIII, Strategic Partners Real Estate VII and BSCH I which are above their respective carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Certain Strategic Partners funds with closed investment periods do not generate carried interest for Blackstone as agreed to at the time the Strategic Partners business was acquired. Blackstone Life Sciences funds have one fund with a closed investment period: Clarus IV, which was above its carried interest threshold.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Segment Distributable Earnings were 375.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 77.0 million, compared to 298.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of 64.4 million in Fee Related Earnings and 12.6 million in Net Realizations. 

 Our Credit Insurance segment continued to demonstrate strong performance in the third quarter of 2024. Longer-term structural shifts in the lending market have contributed to attractive and sizeable deployment opportunities in the segment, which invested 18.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024. As our Credit Insurance funds have also benefited from an environment of high interest rates, a further decline in interest rates and/or widening of credit spreads would make it more difficult for our credit funds to replicate this recent strong performance. However, even with modest decreases in base rates, we continue to see significant opportunities to generate excess returns relative to liquid markets in our non-investment grade strategies. Moreover, lower base rates and rapidly expanding private credit markets should be supportive of overall transaction activity, including deployment. 

 Fundraising in our Credit Insurance segment, including in our perpetual capital strategies, continued to be positively impacted by the long-term structural shifts in the lending market. In addition to strong interest in non-investment grade strategies, such as opportunistic and direct lending, and a meaningful increase in demand for investment grade private credit, we see robust momentum in our perpetual capital strategies. BCRED had 3.0 billion of subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024 and 9.4 billion in the year to date period, surpassing the total amount of subscriptions in 2023. We believe the long-term growth trajectory is positive and that strong investment performance and investor under-allocation to such private wealth strategies should continue to drive flows over the long-term.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Segment Distributable Earnings were 61.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.5 million, compared to 52.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of 6.7 million in Fee Related Earnings and 1.8 million in Net Realizations. 

Nearly all strategies across our Multi-Asset Investing segment exhibited positive performance in the third quarter of 2024, with significantly less volatility than the broader markets. The Absolute Return Composite had its eighteenth consecutive quarter of positive performance, benefiting from performance across strategies, including equities, quantitative and credit. Segment Distributable Earnings in the Multi-Asset Investing segment would likely be negatively impacted, however, by a significant or sustained weak market environment or decline in asset prices, including as a result of concerns over macroeconomic factors. In addition, certain of our strategies are designed to benefit from a high interest rate environment. Declining interest rates may make it more difficult for these Multi-Asset Investing strategies to replicate their positive performance. Conversely, if interest rates remain at sustained high levels for an extended period, certain investors may seek to reallocate capital away from traditional Multi-Asset Investing strategies in favor of fixed income investments. Outperformance by our Multi-Asset Investing segment strategies in a weak market environment has in some cases resulted in such strategies representing an increasing portion of the value of certain investors portfolios, which may limit such investors ability to allocate additional capital to certain funds in the segment, or result in such investors seeking to withdraw capital from such funds.

The returns presented herein represent those of the applicable Blackstone Funds and not those of Blackstone. 

(a)
 
 Composite returns present a summarized asset-weighted return measure to evaluate the overall performance of the applicable class of Blackstone Funds. 

(b)
 
 Absolute Return Composite covers the period from January 2000 to present, although BXMA s inception date is September 1990. The Absolute Return Composite includes only BXMA-managed commingled and customized multi-manager funds and accounts and does not include BXMA s liquid solutions, seeding, Multi-Strategy, Harvest and advisory (non-discretionary) platforms, except for investments by Absolute Return funds directly into those platforms. BXMA-managed funds in liquidation and, in the case of net returns, non-fee-paying assets are also excluded. The funds/accounts that comprise the Absolute Return Composite are not managed within a single fund or account and are managed with different mandates. There is no guarantee that BXMA would have made the same mix of investments in a stand-alone fund/account. The Absolute Return Composite is not an investible product and, as such, the performance of the Absolute Return Composite does not represent the performance of an actual fund or account. The historical return is from January 1, 2000.

(a)
 
 Estimated Above High Water Mark/Benchmark represents the percentage of Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management that as of the dates presented would earn performance fees when the applicable Multi-Asset Investing managed fund has positive investment performance relative to a benchmark, where applicable. Incremental positive performance in the applicable Blackstone Funds may cause additional assets to reach their respective High Water Mark or clear a benchmark return, thereby resulting in an increase in Estimated Above High Water Mark/Benchmark. 

(b)
 
 For the Multi-Asset Investing managed funds, at September 30, 2024, the incremental appreciation needed for the 2 of Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management below their respective High Water Marks/Benchmarks to reach their respective High Water Marks/Benchmarks was 125.7 million, a decrease of (415.4) million, compared to 541.1 million at September 30, 2023. Of the Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management below their respective High Water Marks/Benchmarks as of September 30, 2024, 6 were within 5 of reaching their respective High Water Mark. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General 

Blackstone s business model derives revenue primarily from third party Assets Under Management. Blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. As a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. We draw primarily on the long-term committed or invested capital of investors in our investment vehicles to fund the investment requirements of the Blackstone Funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5 of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to stockholders and distributions to holders of Holdings Units. 

 Fluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the Blackstone Funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes. The majority economic ownership interests of such consolidated Blackstone funds are reflected as Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities, and Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidation of these Blackstone Funds has no net effect on Blackstone s Net Income or Equity. Additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in Blackstone investments in the non-consolidated Blackstone Funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the non-consolidated Blackstone Funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees.

 Total Assets were 42.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.3 billion from December 31, 2023. The increase in Total Assets was principally due to an increase of 2.9 billion in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships, partially offset by a decrease of 549.2 million in total assets attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds. 

The increase in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to increases of 2.7 billion in Investments and 708.6 million in Due from Affiliates, partially offset by a decrease of 602.5 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents. 

o
 
 The increase in Investments was primarily due to appreciation in our Private Equity segment, partially offset by net sales in our Private Equity segment. 

o
 
 The increase in Due from Affiliates was primarily due to an increase in amounts due from certain non-controlling interest holders and Blackstone employees. 

o
 
 The decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents was primarily due to ongoing operating activities. 

The decrease in total assets attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds was primarily due to decreases of 446.5 million in Investments and 135.7 million in Cash Held by Blackstone Funds and Other, which were primarily due to the deconsolidation of two CLOs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Total Liabilities were 23.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 898.2 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in Total Liabilities was principally due to an increase of 1.8 billion in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships, partially offset by a decrease of 898.2 million in total liabilities attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds. 

The increase in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to increases of 1.2 billion in Accrued Compensation and Benefits and 242.9 million in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities. 

o
 
 The increase in Accrued Compensation and Benefits was primarily due to an increase in compensation-related accruals. 

o
 
 The increase in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities was primarily due to an increase in derivative liabilities. 

The decrease in total liabilities attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds was primarily due to decreases of 579.4 million in Loans Payable and 317.5 million in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, which were primarily due to the deconsolidation of two CLOs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Sources and Uses of Liquidity 

We have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our 4.325 billion committed revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, Blackstone had 2.4 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents, 147.6 million invested in Corporate Treasury Investments and 5.6 billion in Other Investments (which included 5.1 billion of liquid investments), against 10.7 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 

127 

Table of Contents 

 In addition to the cash we receive from our notes offerings and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) Performance Revenue realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. The amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. Our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. Therefore, Blackstone s commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position. 

 We expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees and other obligations as they arise, (d) fund modest capital expenditures, (e) repay borrowings and related interest costs, (f) pay income taxes, (g) repurchase shares of our common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units pursuant to our repurchase program and (h) pay dividends to our stockholders and distributions to the holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. For a tabular presentation of Blackstone s contractual obligations and the expected timing of such see Contractual Obligations.

(a)
 
 We expect our commitments to be drawn down over time and to be funded by available cash and cash generated from operations and realizations. Taking into account prevailing market conditions and both the liquidity and cash or liquid investment balances, we believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. Additionally, for some of the general partner commitments shown in the table above, we require our senior managing directors and certain other professionals to fund a portion of the commitment even though the ultimate obligation to fund the aggregate commitment is ours pursuant to the governing agreements of the respective funds. The amounts of the aggregate applicable general partner original and remaining commitment are shown in the table above. 

(b)
 
 Includes the full portion of our commitments (i) required to be funded by senior managing directors and certain other professionals and (ii) that are elected by such individuals to be funded for the life of a fund, where such fund permits such election. Excludes amounts that are elected by such individuals to be funded on an annual basis and certain de minimis commitments funded by such individuals in certain carry funds. 

(c)
 
 Represents capital commitments to a number of other funds in each respective segment. 

(d)
 
 Represents loan origination commitments, revolver commitments and capital market commitments.

 The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Blackstone Inc. and each of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. The Notes contain customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit the Issuer and the guarantors ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The Notes also contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the Notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the Notes. 

 Blackstone, through the Issuer, has a 4.325 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent with a maturity date of December 15, 2028. Borrowings may also be made in U.K. sterling, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen or Canadian dollars, in each case subject to certain sub-limits. The Credit Facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. Financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of fee-earning assets under management, each tested quarterly.

 We lease our primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2043. Occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses and utilities. To the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. The table above includes operating leases that are recognized as Operating Lease Liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities.

(b)
 
 Represents the principal amounts due on our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no pre-payments and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings we project pre-payments based on the performance of the underlying assets and principal may be paid down in full prior to their stated maturity. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolver. 

(c)
 
 Represents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no pre-payments and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings, we project pre-payments based on the performance of the underlying assets with interest payments based on the estimated principal outstanding, inclusive of projected pre-payments. These amounts include commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under our revolver. 

(d)
 
 These obligations represent commitments of the consolidated Blackstone funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. 

(e)
 
 Represents obligations by Blackstone s corporate subsidiary to make payments under the tax receivable agreements to certain non-controlling interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of Blackstone s initial public offering IPO in 2007 and subsequent purchases. The obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. As required by GAAP, the amount of the obligation included in the condensed consolidated financial statements and shown in Note 16. Related Party Transactions (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain non-controlling interest holders. 

(f)
 
 Blackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of 247.0 million and interest of 81.0 million as of September 30, 2024; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. 

(g)
 
 These obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the Blackstone Funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and Blackstone principal investment commitments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. We expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time. 

 Guarantees 

Blackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. The amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Guarantees in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 

 Indemnifications 

In many of its service contracts, Blackstone agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the above contractual obligations table or recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. 

 Clawback Obligations 

Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceed the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The amounts and nature of Blackstone s clawback obligations are described in Note 17.

 Share Repurchase Program 

On July 16, 2024, Blackstone s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2.0 billion of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. This authorization replaced Blackstone s prior 2.0 billion repurchase authorization. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. 

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Blackstone repurchased 1.0 million and 3.7 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 140.8 million and 473.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was 1.9 billion. 

 Dividends 

Our intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85 of Blackstone Inc. s share of Distributable Earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and dividends to stockholders for any ensuing quarter. The dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter. 

 For Blackstone s definition of Distributable Earnings, see Key Financial Measures and Indicators. 

 All of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely. 

 Because the publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by Blackstone to common stockholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to the Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships in respect of their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. Following Blackstone s conversion from a limited partnership to a corporation, we expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we would have as a limited partnership, which will increase this difference between the per share dividend and per unit distribution amounts. 

 Dividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of Blackstone s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s basis. 

135 

Table of Contents 

The following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common stockholder dividends for 2024 and 2023. Dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned. 

With respect to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we declared to stockholders of our common stock a dividend of 0.86 per share, aggregating to 2.51 per share of common stock in respect of the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024. With respect to fiscal year 2023, we paid stockholders aggregate dividends of 3.35 per share.

We may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for Blackstone and our stockholders. In addition to the borrowings from our note issuances and our revolving credit facility, we may use asset based financing arrangements, including but not limited to, margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. Reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. Repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. The balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on Blackstone s liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles.

Critical Accounting Policies 

We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. Actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 

 Principles of Consolidation 

For a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation and Note 9. Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements for detailed information on Blackstone s involvement with VIEs. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. 

 The determination that Blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. In our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included in this filing, we present 100 of the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs along with a non-controlling interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle s interests held by third parties. However, assets of our consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and are not available for general use by Blackstone. Further, the liabilities of our consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of Blackstone. In the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, we eliminate any management fees, Incentive Fees, or Performance Allocations received or accrued from consolidated VIEs as they are considered intercompany transactions. We recognize 100 of the consolidated VIE s investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third party ownership to non-controlling interests in arriving at Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. 

137 

Table of Contents 

 The assessment of whether we consolidate a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the VIE and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: 

Determining whether our management fees, Incentive Fees or Performance Allocations represent variable interests We make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. In making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the VIE. 

Determining whether kick-out rights are substantive We make judgments as to whether the third party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. This includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist. 

Concluding whether Blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE As there is no explicit threshold in GAAP to define potentially significant, management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met. 

 Revenue Recognition 

For a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements. For an additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, Incentive Fees, and Performance Allocations are generated, please refer to Part I. Item 1. Business Fee Structure/Incentive Arrangements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. 

 Management and Advisory Fees, Net

 Blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base which is typically assets under management, net asset value, gross asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital. The range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows: 

 On private equity, real estate, and certain of our multi-asset investing and credit-focused funds: 

0.25 to 1.75 of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period, 

0.25 to 1.50 of invested capital, committed capital or investment fair value subsequent to the investment period for private equity and real estate funds, and 

1.15 to 1.50 of invested capital or net asset value subsequent to the investment period for certain of our multi-asset investing and credit-focused
 funds. 

 On real estate and credit-focused funds structured like hedge funds: 

0.50 to 1.00 of net asset value. 

 On credit separately managed accounts: 

0.20 to 1.35 of net asset value or total assets. 

138 

Table of Contents 

 On real estate separately managed accounts: 

0.35 to 2.00 of invested capital, net operating income or net asset value. 

 On insurance separately managed accounts and investment vehicles: 

0.25 to 1.00 of net asset value. 

 On funds of hedge funds, certain hedge funds and separately managed accounts invested in hedge funds: 

0.20 to 1.50 of net asset value. 

 On CLO vehicles: 

0.20 to 0.50 of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash. 

 On credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies: 

0.25 to 1.25 of total assets or net asset value. 

 On certain real estate and private equity-focused registered funds or companies: 

1.25 of net asset value. 

 The investment adviser of BXMT receives annual management fees based on 1.50 of BXMT s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated distributable earnings (which is generally equal to its GAAP net income excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. 

 Management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value, total assets, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. See Fair Value below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments. 

 Investment Income (Loss)

 Performance Allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. Blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle Blackstone to a Performance Allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the GAAP guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. Blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, Blackstone s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period Blackstone calculates the accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results. 

 The change in the fair value of the investments held by certain Blackstone Funds is a significant input into the accrued Performance Allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. See Fair Value below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments.

 Fair Value 

Blackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. For a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Investments, at Fair Value in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. 

 The fair value of the investments held by Blackstone Funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, Incentive Fees, Performance Allocations and the related Compensation we recognize. Generally, Blackstone Funds are accounted for as investment companies under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies

, and in accordance with the GAAP guidance on investment companies and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments (the Portfolio Companies ), at fair value. In the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. For investments where little market activity exists management s determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. 

 Blackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables, investments in private debt securities and other proprietary investments. Blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives. 

 Fair Value of Investments or Instruments that are Publicly Traded 

Securities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. When a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. In some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time. A discount to publicly traded price may be appropriate in instances where a legal restriction is a characteristic of the security, such as may be required under SEC Rule 144. The amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale. 

 Fair Value of Investments or Instruments that are not Publicly Traded 

Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. Our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment s projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. Our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income 

140 

Table of Contents 

approach, is typically the market approach. The most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. Depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, discount to sale, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing. 

 In certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. 

 Management Process on Fair Value 

Due to the importance of fair value throughout the condensed consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. Investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams. For investments held by vehicles managed by more than one business unit, Blackstone has developed a process designed to facilitate coordination and alignment, as appropriate, of the fair value of in-scope investments across business units. 

 For investments valued utilizing the income method and where Blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the Portfolio Companies and underlying assets finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple or capitalization rate, and any other valuation input relevant to economic conditions. 

 The results of all valuations of investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are reviewed by the relevant business unit s valuation sub-committee, which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. To further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. Our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. Each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our non-employee directors. 

 Income Tax 

For a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13. Income Taxes in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 

 Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. 

141 

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that Blackstone uses to manage its business. To the extent any portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. 

 Revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. 

 Recent Accounting Developments 

Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on Blackstone, if any, can be found in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment adviser to the Blackstone Funds and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect on management fees, performance revenues and investment income. There were no material changes in our market risks as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. For additional information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives. 

 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective at the reasonable assurance level to accomplish their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the 

142 

Table of Contents 

 Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

 Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We may from time to time be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We are not currently subject to any pending legal (including judicial, regulatory, administrative or arbitration) proceedings that we expect to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, given the inherent unpredictability of these types of proceedings and the potentially large and/or indeterminate amounts that could be sought, an adverse outcome in certain matters could have a material effect on Blackstone s financial results in any particular period. See Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Litigation. 

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our subsequently filed periodic reports as such factors may be updated from time to time, all of which are accessible on the Securities and Exchange Commission s website at www.sec.gov. 

 See Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Environment in this report for a discussion of the conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions affecting our businesses. This discussion updates, and should be read together with, the risk factor entitled Difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition. in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

 The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our subsequently filed periodic reports are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the General Partner. The Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by
the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect to indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered
Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). 
 24 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty,
it is understood and/or agreed that the Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable
law governing SP GP Solutions and/or a particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in
the following order of priority: first , out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP GP Solutions; second , by the applicable portfolio entity through
which such investment is indirectly held; and third , by SP GP Solutions (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). 
 (A) The Partnership s obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any
amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP GP Solutions and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the
Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP GP Solutions and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it is
agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP GP Solutions and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to
structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or
advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing. Section 3.6. Representations of Partners . 
 (a) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner by execution of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the terms and conditions hereof
as provided herein or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Partner is acquiring each of such Partner s Interests for such
Partner s own account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Partner hereunder; provided , that a
Partner may choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (pursuant to Section 6.3(a) and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents and warrants that such Partner
understands that the Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act, and therefore such Interests may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act or exemption from such registration, and that accordingly such Partner
must bear the economic risk of an investment in the Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that such Partner has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that such
Partner is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, and that such Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that such Partner s
overall commitment to the Partnership and other investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Partner s net worth and the Partner has no need for liquidity in the Partner s investment in Interests. Each
Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of the Partner, the Partner has been furnished any materials that such Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment
 
 25 

and the offering of Interests and has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any
matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the
Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner. 
 (b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be
true and correct as of any date that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that
such capital contribution shall serve as confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof. 
 Section 3.7. Tax Representation and Further Assurances . Each Limited Partner and Special Partner, upon the request of the
General Partner, agrees to perform all further acts and to execute, acknowledge and deliver any documents that may be reasonably necessary to comply with the General Partner s or the Partnership s obligations under applicable law or to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement. (a) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner certifies that (A) if the Limited Partner
or Special Partner is a United States person (as defined in the Code) (x) (i) the Limited Partner or Special Partner s name, social security number (or, if applicable, employer identification number) and address provided to the Partnership
and its Affiliates pursuant to an IRS Form W 9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number Certification W 9 or otherwise are correct and (ii) the Limited Partner or Special Partner will complete and return a W 9 and
(y) (i) the Limited Partner or Special Partner is a United States person (as defined in the Code) and (ii) the Limited Partner or Special Partner will notify the Partnership within 60 days of a change to foreign (non-United States) status or (B) if the Limited Partner or Special Partner is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) (x) (i) the information on the completed IRS Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals) W-8BEN ), IRS Form W-8BEN-E, Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities) W-8BEN-E ), or other applicable form, including but not limited to IRS Form W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or
Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting W-8IMY ), or otherwise is correct and (ii) the Limited Partner or Special Partner will complete and return the
applicable IRS form, including but not limited to a W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY, and
(y) (i) the Limited Partner or Special Partner is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) and (ii) the Limited Partner or Special Partner will notify the Partnership within 60 days of any change of such status. Each Limited
Partner and Special Partner agrees to provide such cooperation and assistance, including but not limited to properly executing and providing to the Partnership in a timely manner any tax or other documentation or information that may be reasonably
requested by the Partnership or the General Partner. 
 26 

(b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership
and the General Partner may release confidential information or other information about the Limited Partner or Special Partner or related to such Limited Partner or Special Partner s investment in the Partnership if the Partnership or the
General Partner, in its or their sole discretion, determines that such disclosure is required by applicable law or regulation or in order to comply for an exception from, or reduced tax rate of, tax or other tax benefit. Any such disclosure shall
not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed on any such person by law or otherwise, and a Limited Partner or Special Partner shall have no claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of
their Affiliates for any form of damages or liability as a result of actions taken by the foregoing in order to comply with any disclosure obligations that the foregoing reasonably believe are required by law, regulation or otherwise. 
 (c) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that if it provides information that is in anyway materially misleading,
or if it fails to provide the Partnership or its agents with any information requested hereunder, in either case in order to satisfy the Partnership s obligations, the General Partner reserves the right to take any action and pursue any
remedies at its disposal, including (i) requiring such Limited Partner or Special Partner to Withdraw for Cause and (ii) withholding or deducting any costs caused by such Limited Partner s or Special Partner s action or inaction
from amounts otherwise distributable to such Limited Partner or Special Partner from the Partnership and its Affiliates. ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the
Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required
to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP GP Solutions in respect of the GP-Related SP GP Solutions Interest with respect to any
 GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if
any, or otherwise; provided, that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based
upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for
ongoing business operations (as distinct from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General Partner.
Special Partners shall not be required to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except
(i) as a condition of an increase in such Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided , that the General Partner
and any Special Partner may agree from time to time that such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided , further , that each Investor
Special Partner shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time
to time and (ii) the total capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP GP Solutions Interest. 
 27 

(a) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a
Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (b) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional
Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital
Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by the General Partner. 
 (c) (i) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which certain amounts of the
distributions relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a Holdback ). The General Partner
shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld percentage constituting the General Partner s
and such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than the General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn
Partners (other than the General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for the General Partner and/or
Holdings shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). (ii) The
Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the
Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 ,
respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. 
 (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her
Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners 
Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to
24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to
distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The 
 28 

foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with
the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently
increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . (iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General
Partner may increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback Vote 
 provided , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and
(y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such
decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or
assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not
be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. 
 (A) A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote
with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 
 (B) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject
Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually
satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided 
 further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject
Partner that submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected
 out-of- 
 29 

pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated
expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration (including
costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses
of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party shall be the Partnership if the
Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject
Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (C) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the Excess
Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust
Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging, granting a
security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner
seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a
first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s books and records in which
Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority
 
 30 

security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a
second priority security interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest
is available, or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net
proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. 
 (A) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral
Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm
Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization,
if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default
under this clause (C); provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such
term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 31 

(vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any
Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner or (B) require the Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the
benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from
a commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or
(y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below
the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient
L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP GP Solutions, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a
commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The
Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under
the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the
termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the
extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback
obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category
of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 32 

(vii) Any in-kind distributions by
the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind 
distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. 
 (A) In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s books and records; provided , that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral
shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such
Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount from the Trust Account. 
 (viii) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not
the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging or granting a
security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith
judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (A) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess
Holdback) is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust
Account)), then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or
other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes
hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a
Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
deficiency with respect to his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. 
 33 

(B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or
any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such
deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party 
where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (C) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may revoke the ability of such
Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn
Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback). (D) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner from using any
amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided , that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 34 

Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital
related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement or (iii) as determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V 
 PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES 
 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . 
 (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each

Account ). (b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one or more of
the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited with the
following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest during such
accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related to such

percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting
period pursuant to Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (c) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately
prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end
of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion.

within 90 days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) . 
 (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related Investment of all the Partners
participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than
amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to Partners that received Non-Carried 
Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP-Related Net Income is
being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts
representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. 
 (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP GP Solutions and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on capital contributions made by the
Partnership to SP GP Solutions with respect to the GP-Related SP GP Solutions Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s
 Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP GP Solutions and
 (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP GP Solutions and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a
Partner s (including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 38 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above,
 GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be
allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such
 GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period unrelated to SP GP Solutions, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such accounting period. (e) The
General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any
Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems
reasonably necessary for this purpose. Section 5.5. Liability of Partners . Except as otherwise provided in the
Partnership Act or as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall be personally obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner solely by reason of being a Partner. In no event shall any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner (i) be obligated to make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as
specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally Omitted] . 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investments as the General Partner may determine. The
General Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that
is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 39 

Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or other
property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing
Percentages. (i) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP GP Solutions of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP GP Solutions) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment
(with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP GP Solutions) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income, and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 40 

(c) The General Partner may provide that the
 GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee (including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase
by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will
be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof (together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to
the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share
of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless
determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective
percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner;
 provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn
Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor
Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. 
 (d) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP GP Solutions a Clawback Amount or
a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP GP Solutions Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback
Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as determined by the
General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund GPs) with respect
to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related 
Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership in the case of
Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest and/or
 Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback
Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP GP Solutions
Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above,
and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP GP Solutions Agreement is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investment, all
GP- 
 41 

Related SP GP Solutions Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund
GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the
Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on
an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the
amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s
judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a
Partner s Trust Account used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust
Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. 
 (A) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment
hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the SP GP Solutions Partnership Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall
have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro
rata share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP GP Solutions Partnership Agreement. 
 42 

(ii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other
Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a
 GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from
such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date
that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e),
no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 (A) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not
attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or
equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the
 GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be
 
 43 

necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related 
Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a
rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. (B) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first
seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution.
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute. 
 (iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating Losses (as defined in the SP GP Solutions
Agreements) on GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss
Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related SP GP Solutions
Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a
 GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP GP Solutions Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner
shall calculate amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share
of each such Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for
distribution to all Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP GP Solutions) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 44 

(B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise
distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP GP Solutions) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried
Interest Distributions and (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from
(II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income Tax Rate (as defined in the SP GP Solutions
Agreements) in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise
distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined
(as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net
Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be
allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. A
Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all
purposes hereof. A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject
to a Holdback, to the extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account
any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 45 

Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner,
including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such
amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried
Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be
contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses (as defined in the SP GP Solutions Agreements) in any GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investment with respect to
which Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP GP Solutions Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 
 46 

It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the
Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP GP Solutions Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing and in accordance with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), the Partnership shall, (i) calculate separate allocations attributable to (A) the Carried Interest and any other distribution entitlements that are not
commensurate with capital contributed to the Partnership, and (B) any distribution entitlements of the Partners that are commensurate with capital contributed to the Partnership (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B) and as reasonably determined by the General Partner), and (ii) consistently reflect each such allocation in its books and records. 
 (b) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and
local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable
law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its
respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated
shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are
in accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. 
 47 

(c) For U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain,
loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions
of this Section 5.10; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations have substantial economic effect or are in accordance with
the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority to any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an
adjustment to any Partner s distributive share thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined by the General Partner) in accordance with the final resolution of such audit
adjustment. ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms of such additional Partner s
participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution,
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time
unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special
Partner ). Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note
approved by the General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or
such other or subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a
 GP-Related Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. 
 (b) The GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of
the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General
Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other
Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General 
 48 

Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any further act, vote or consent of any person, to make
adjustments to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to
other Partners of the Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. (c) An additional Partner shall be
required to contribute to the Partnership his or her pro rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which
such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. 
 (d) The admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of this Agreement by such
additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional Partner, as determined by the General Partner, (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing
evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such writing being acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership and/or (iv) the listing of such additional
Partner in the books and records of the Partnership by the General Partner. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the
Trust Agreement that is acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. Section 6.2. Withdrawal of
Partners . (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner,
including if such Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its
business. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion), on not less than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided , that a Partner
may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner
Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest. (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence
of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. 
 49 

(c) Upon the Total Disability of a Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be
a Limited Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided , that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special
Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of
whether any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party
shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such person s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If the
General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such
notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. (e) The Withdrawal
from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the
Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. 
 Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not Transferable . 
 (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided , that this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by
operation of law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further , that, subject to the prior written
consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any
estate planning trust, limited partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each
Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with
respect to the Partnership (including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require any
Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance,
operation of law or otherwise) of the whole or any 
 50 

portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner
(which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a Partner of the
Partnership. (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . 
 (a) Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its
right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute
General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided however , that the General Partner may,
in its sole discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or
otherwise) and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such
person of liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General
Partner and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon
the collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as
contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or
more of such remaining Partners continue the business of the Partnership (any and all such remaining Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). Notwithstanding
Section 6.4(c), if upon the Withdrawal of a Partner there shall be no remaining Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be dissolved and shall be wound up unless, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Withdrawal, all remaining Special
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. 
 (c) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or
remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 51 

Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests . (a) The terms of this
Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner
Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner
Interest is retained as a Special Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date
for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall
be his or her Withdrawal Date; provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month
in which his or her Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained
a Partner of the Partnership during such period. (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). 
 52 

(e) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with
respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment)
and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph
(f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate
negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided , that if the Withdrawn Partner
was solely a Special Partner on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Special Partner, upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the General Partner as of
such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or
the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 (i) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described
below, to receive a Nonvoting Special Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than
all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Investor Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. The election referred to
above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership
pursuant to this Section 6.5. 
 53 

(f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s
 percentage interest means his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn
Partner shall retain his or her percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable
to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn Partner shall become and remain a Special Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so
designates, such Special Partner shall be a Nonvoting Special Partner). The GP-Related Partner Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole
discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that
the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to this sentence. (g)
The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to paragraph (e) above, to (i) have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to
(ii) distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be
reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General
Partner. (h) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of
such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind distributions to be made
to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in respect of the settlement
of his or her GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above or
adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by
the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of
payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or
distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of
the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. 
 54 

(j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date
in making the foregoing calculations should prove, in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess,
or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such deficiency, as the case may be. (k) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn
Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after the Settlement Date e.g. , outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the
Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under
this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at a floating rate equal to the lesser of (x) the Prime Rate or (y) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. The due date of
amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in respect of GP-Related Investments for which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph (f) above shall be 120 days after realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such amounts are determined to be payable. 
 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of a security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with
respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his or her GP-Related Partner Interest shall be settled in
accordance with paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5; provided , that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such
settlement: (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any
 GP-Related Investment in which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized
Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn
Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her
 GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn
 
 55 

Partner or (C) apply the provisions of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to
such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any,
attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the
General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned on the compliance by such
Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a period not exceeding two
years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph (n) may elect to forfeit the
principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such restrictions. 
 (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the General Partner) a
discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. (p) The
provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Special Partner relating to a Limited Partner or Special Partner and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner
pursuant to Section 6.3 if such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership. (q) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his
or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine
in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or
her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it
can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 56 

(r) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General
Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make,
execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter
contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5, including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is
coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 6.6. Dissolution of the Partnership . The General Partner may dissolve the Partnership prior to the expiration of its
term at any time on not less than 60 days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.5. Section 6.7. Certain Tax Matters . The General Partner
shall determine all matters concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion. (a) The
General Partner shall cause to be prepared all federal, state and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns
to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the
several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any
and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he or she shall not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his or her interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information
statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his or her income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of
an income tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any
administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his or her
decision shall be final and binding upon, the Partnership and all Partners except to the extent a Partner shall properly elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in
connection therewith (including, without limitation, attorneys , accountants and other experts fees and disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and (C) no Partner shall have the right to (1) participate in the
audit of any Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended 
 57 

return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership (unless he or she provides prior notice of such
action to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund
or denial of such claim, or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the
Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as
the partnership representative (as defined under the Code) (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other
Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.7 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. 
 (b) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each federal, state and local income tax return of such Partner
(including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. (c) To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines
that the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership holds an interest) is or may be required by law to withhold or to make tax payments, including interest and penalties on such amounts, on behalf of or with respect to any Partner or as a
result of a Partner s participation in the Partnership or as a result of a Partner s failure to provide requested tax information, including pursuant to Section 6225 or Section 1446(f) of the Code Tax
Advances ), the General Partner may withhold or escrow such amounts or make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner shall, at the option of the General Partner, (i) be promptly paid to the
Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such
distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for
repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the Partnership) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance.
To the extent that any taxes are imposed on the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership invests that is treated as a flow-through entity for relevant tax purposes) with respect to income of the Partnership (or such entity) in lieu of
taxes imposed directly on a Partner with respect to such income (including any state or local income taxes), whether by election of the Partnership or the General Partner or otherwise, such amounts shall be deemed to have been distributed to such
Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties,
additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from the
Partnership or any Transfer of a Partner s interest. 
 58 

Section 6.8. Special Basis Adjustments . In connection with any assignment
or transfer of a Partnership interest permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the manner provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.754-1(b), to make an election to adjust the basis of the Partnership s property in the manner provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code. 
 ARTICLE VII CAPITAL COMMITMENT

 Section 7.1. Capital Commitment Interests, etc. 
 (a) This Article VII and Article VIII hereof set forth certain terms and conditions with respect to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests
and the Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Interest and matters related to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VII or in Article VIII,

 (b) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to SP GP Solutions in respect of the Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Commitment, if any

Capital Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each
Capital Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the
Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment, or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or
SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms
upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related
Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 59 

(c) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing
Party may in its sole discretion advance to any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any
portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions due to the Partnership from such Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Partner shall pay interest to the Advancing
Party on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the
Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party
absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such
rate upon such Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant
to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of
Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed
the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
 
 60 

such Capital Commitment Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such
Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net
Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in
proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special
costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 7.7 shall be specially allocated to the electing Partner. 
 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to
the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments,
distributions to such Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including, without limitation, Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests)
during a Fiscal Year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such Fiscal Year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole discretion of the
General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected
by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): (i) First, to the
payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise) of such Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all
interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on income of
the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to the limitation that
the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an individual subject to the
then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes 
 61 

(including, without limitation, taxes imposed under Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character of such taxable income allocated by the Partnership and the limitations on
deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes); provided , that additional amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise
distributable to the Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further , that
amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BE Agreements that are
comparable to this clause (ii); (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing
(A) any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year or (B) any BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year, to the extent not repaid from
Other Sources; (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions
made in respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Entity (other than the Partnership) in
respect of interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts
of Other Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); (v) Fifth, to the payment of
principal (including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the
division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any
Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the
Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the
Lender or Guarantor; and (vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income
remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 62 

To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other
BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest
payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate
thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in
respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or
other distribution remaining thereafter distributed to such Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any
other time at the discretion of the General Partner. At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal
payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period in respect of which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a Capital Commitment Investment
is being considered by the Partnership or SP GP Solutions (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to such Capital Commitment
Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
 
 63 

Class B Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment
Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class A Interests. (g) If the Partnership is obligated under the
Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP GP Solutions a Giveback Amount with respect to any Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a
 Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn
Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Interest (the Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback
Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation and
(c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP GP Solutions Agreement is unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Investment, all Capital Commitment SP GP Solutions Investments. Each Partner shall
promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation to),
provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). 
 (i) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any
portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP Related Defaulting Party and
(ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment
Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith
judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership
is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner s in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect
such amount in light 
 64 

of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies
(at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that
the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment
Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security
interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of
such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the
immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was
required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. (A) Any Partner s failure
to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. 
 (ii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the
termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5. Valuations . Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of
the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any other Affiliate of the Partnership that is a general partner of SP GP Solutions) in
valuing investments of SP GP Solutions or, in the case of investments not held by SP GP Solutions, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any
Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided , that the Capital Commitment Value may be
determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further , that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating solely to the value of a
Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control of the underlying Capital
Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further , that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any Capital Commitment
Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member or partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. 
 65 

Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such
Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the
Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not
be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to

 66 

Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal

Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided 
 further , that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph
(b) below. Prepayments made by a Partner shall apply pro rata against all of such Partner s Investor Notes; provided , that such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments
that are related to one or more Blackstone Entities specified by such Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests.

the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by
the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s) within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require

outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to be repurchased, plus (y) all
Capital Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such
Capital Commitment Interest; provided , that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General
Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income
received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment 
 67 

Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative, it shall be payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next
Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or
(B) if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase;
 provided , that the Partnership and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear
interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. 
 (ii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an officer or employee, all Investor Notes shall become fully recourse to the
Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). 
 (iii) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of
such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn
Partner in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the Partnership shall apply such
prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. (iv) To the extent that another Partner purchases a
portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly
increased. (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with
respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the
Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner
Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time,
in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of
law or otherwise and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in
 
 68 

the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal
or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. (d) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability) (and the purchase
price for such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal representative or other Successor in
Interest, in cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, so requests in
writing within 180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year),
the Partnership or its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as of the last day of the
Partnership s then current Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his or her will
to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, within 30 days of the
first date on which the General Partner knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in
Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment
Value thereof. (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Partner with respect to any
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an employee or officer of the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn
Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Partner or another Affiliate of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined in 
 69 

good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase). The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to
paragraph (d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 (f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as
described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or
a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such
repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest
relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment
Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or
(ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse
basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree; provided , that such indebtedness shall become
fully recourse to the extent and at the time provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be non-recourse or so limited, the Partnership may require an
assumption by the Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Partners; provided , that a Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor
Note(s), be obligated to accept any obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this Section 8.1), unless his or her prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment
Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to
which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion
his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such
proportions. 
 70 

(g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1;
 provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement:
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interest); (ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain such
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment
shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof;
or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory
note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. (h) The Partnership will assist a
Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to
retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or
guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to
interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without
limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 71 

Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment
Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided , that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase
of a Withdrawn Partner s or Deceased or Totally Disabled Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another
Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without
giving any reason therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning
Vehicle (it being understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General
Partner in connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General
Partner shall designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such
Partner and such Nonvoting Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require
such Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Partner of the Partnership, or acquire
such Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment
of, or the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital
Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 72 

ARTICLE IX 
 DISSOLUTION 
 Section 9.1. Dissolution . The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (a) pursuant to Section 6.6; or 
 (b) upon the expiration of the term of the Partnership. 
 Section 9.2. Final Distribution . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, and following the payment of creditors of the
Partnership and the making of provisions for the payment of any contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the Partnership as required under the Partnership Act: 
 (a) The Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the GP-Related Capital Account
balances of the Partners; and (b) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to
such Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment
Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment;
and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. The General Partner shall be the liquidator. In the
event that the General Partner is unable to serve as liquidator, a liquidating trustee shall be chosen by the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Partners voting at a meeting of Partners (excluding Nonvoting Special Partners). 
 Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner Interests . 
 (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner
Interests which, in the judgment of the liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in each such
Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro
rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the liquidator shall determine. 
 (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to
such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may
meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on
account of such transaction or claim. 
 73 

(c) Upon determination by the liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion
of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such
Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably,
including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including
the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as any and all disputes arising out of, relating to or in connection with the termination, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership), whether arising during the
existence of the Partnership or at or after its termination or during or after the liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York U.S.A., in accordance
with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the
International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration
proceedings. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may cause the Partnership to bring,
on behalf of the General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary
relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this Section 10.1 to any such
action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably

 74 

(b) EACH PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW
YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award.
The parties acknowledge that the forum(s) designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another. 
 (i) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such
invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act
or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Blackstone Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C.

successors or assigns) has licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the permission
of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and its
Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such termination, the
Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service mark or otherwise.
 
 75 

Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken
by a vote of Partners at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. 
 Section 10.4. Letter Agreements; Schedules . The General Partner may, or may cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously
entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners, officers or employees with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, benefits or any
other matter, which letter agreements have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing, the terms of this Agreement with respect to any such Partner and such matters. The parties hereto agree that any rights established, or
any terms of this Agreement altered or supplemented, in any such separate letter agreement, including any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, shall govern solely with respect to such Partner notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.
The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever;
 provided , that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement.

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided
therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be
affected thereby. Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto;
 provided , that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including
the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for
the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or
Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based on the standards set forth in Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and
Section 7.4(g)(ii)(A), to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to
any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and
permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the SP GP Solutions Agreements, 
 76 

(x) the limited partners in SP GP Solutions shall be third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating

adverse to such limited partners shall be effective against such limited partners only with the 66 2 3 Combined Limited Partner Consent (as such term is used in the
SP GP Solutions Partnership Agreement). Section 10.7. Confidentiality . 
 (a) By executing this Agreement, each Partner expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or
not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than the Partnership, another Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business,
financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally known to the public or the securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided , that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law, rule, regulation or custom to disclose.

in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee, representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding (a) the
Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any performance information relating to any of the Partners or their
investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax structure information.

violations of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation to or with any governmental agency or regulatory authority (collectively, a Governmental Entity ), including, but not limited to, the SEC, FINRA, EEOC or NLRB, or from
making other disclosures to any Governmental Entity that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation; provided , that in each case such communications and disclosures are consistent with
applicable law. Each Partner understands and acknowledges that (a) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any U.S. federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in
confidence to a U.S. federal, state, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other
proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (b) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade
secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Moreover, a Partner shall not be
 
 77 

required to give prior notice to (or get prior authorization from) Blackstone regarding any such communication or disclosure. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or under applicable

transaction or investment contemplated hereby or thereby) taken or omitted by a Covered Person (other than any act or omission constituting Cause), unless there is a final and non-appealable judicial
determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority
granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of legal counsel to the Partnership, accountants and other experts or professional advisors, and no action taken by any
Covered Person in reliance on such advice shall in any event subject such person to any liability to any Partner or the Partnership. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating
thereto to the Partnership or to another Partner, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such Partner acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any such other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of

indemnify and hold harmless (but only to the extent of the Partnership s assets (including, without limitation, the remaining capital commitments of the Partners)) each Covered Person from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs,
expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any
claim or alleged claim), joint and several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, for purposes of this Section 3.5(b), Losses ), arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person s management of the affairs of
the Partnership or which relate to or arise out of or in connection with the Partnership, its property, its business or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of any act or omission of such Covered Person constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5(b) with respect to any claim, issue or matter if there is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of the Partnership and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement; provided further , that if such Covered Person is a Partner or a Withdrawn Partner, such Covered Person shall bear its share of
such Losses in accordance with such Covered Person s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in the Partnership as of the time of the actions or omissions that gave rise to such Losses. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person (including, without limitation, the General Partner) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval of the General Partner, from time
to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount to the
extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 3.5(b), and the Partnership and its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such Covered
Person s interests/investments in the Partnership and such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a
Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such Partner shall be responsible, up to the amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining capital commitments, for such Partner s pro rata share of the
Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the General Partner. The Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by
the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect to indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered
Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). (i) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty, it is understood and/or agreed that the Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification,
advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable law 
 24 

governing SP Infrastructure IV and/or a particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek
to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the following order of priority: first , out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP Infrastructure IV;
 second , by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment is indirectly held; and third , by SP Infrastructure IV (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). 
 (A) The Partnership s obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any
amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP Infrastructure IV and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the
Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP Infrastructure IV and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it
is agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP Infrastructure IV and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically
empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may determine
necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing. Section 3.6. Representations of Partners .
 (a) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner by execution of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the terms and conditions
hereof as provided herein or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Partner is acquiring each of such Partner s Interests for such
Partner s own account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Partner hereunder; provided , that a
Partner may choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (pursuant to Section 6.3(a) and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents and warrants that such Partner

bear the economic risk of an investment in the Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that such Partner has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, that such Partner
is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, and that such Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that such Partner s overall
commitment to the Partnership and other investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Partner s net worth and the Partner has no need for liquidity in the Partner s investment in Interests. Each Limited
Partner and Special Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of the Partner, the Partner has been furnished any materials that such Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment
 
 25 

and the offering of Interests and has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any
matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the
Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner. 
 (b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be
true and correct as of any date that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that
such capital contribution shall serve as confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

 26 

(b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership
and the General Partner may release confidential information or other information about the Limited Partner or Special Partner or related to such Limited Partner or Special Partner s investment in the Partnership if the Partnership or the
General Partner, in its or their sole discretion, determines that such disclosure is required by applicable law or regulation or in order to comply for an exception from, or reduced tax rate of, tax or other tax benefit. Any such disclosure shall
not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed on any such person by law or otherwise, and a Limited Partner or Special Partner shall have no claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of
their Affiliates for any form of damages or liability as a result of actions taken by the foregoing in order to comply with any disclosure obligations that the foregoing reasonably believe are required by law, regulation or otherwise. 
 (c) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that if it provides information that is in anyway materially misleading,
or if it fails to provide the Partnership or its agents with any information requested hereunder, in either case in order to satisfy the Partnership s obligations, the General Partner reserves the right to take any action and pursue any
remedies at its disposal, including (i) requiring such Limited Partner or Special Partner to Withdraw for Cause and (ii) withholding or deducting any costs caused by such Limited Partner s or Special Partner s action or inaction

 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the
Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required
to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP Infrastructure IV in respect of the GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Interest with respect to any
 GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement,
if any, or otherwise; provided, that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners
based upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used
for ongoing business operations (as distinct from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General Partner.
Special Partners shall not be required to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except
(i) as a condition of an increase in such Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner and any
Special Partner may agree from time to time that such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided, further, that each Investor Special Partner shall
maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and
(ii) the total capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Interest. 
 27 

(a) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a
Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (b) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional
Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital
Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by the General Partner. 
 (c) (i) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which certain amounts of the
distributions relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a Holdback ). The General Partner
shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld percentage constituting the General Partner s
and such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than the General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn
Partners (other than the General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for the General Partner and/or
Holdings shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). (ii) The
Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the
Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 ,
respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. 
 (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her
Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners 
Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to
24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to
distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The 
 28 

foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with
the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently
increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . (iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General
Partner may increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback Vote 
 provided , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and
(y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such
decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or
assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not
be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. 
 (A) A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote
with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 
 (B) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject
Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided, that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory
arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided further, that if such candidates
fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that submits the decision of the
Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected out-of- 
 29 

pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated
expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration (including
costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses
of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party shall be the Partnership if the
Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject
Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (C) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the Excess
Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust
Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging, granting a
security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner
seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a
first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s books and records in which
Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority
 
 30 

security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a
second priority security interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest
is available, or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net
proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. 
 (A) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral
Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner
from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement
(allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement
shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm Collateral that
results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization, if net proceeds
therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback requirement. If any such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this clause
(C); provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 31 

(vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any
Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner or (B) require the Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the
benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from
a commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or
(y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below
the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient
L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP Infrastructure IV, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a
commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The
Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under
the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the
termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the
extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback
obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category
of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 32 

(vii) Any in-kind distributions by
the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind 
distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. 
 (A) In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s books and records; provided, that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall
initially equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special
Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount from the Trust Account. 
 (viii) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not
the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging or granting a
security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith
judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (A) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess
Holdback) is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust
Account)), then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or
other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes
hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a
Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
deficiency with respect to his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. 
 33 

(B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or
any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such
deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term
appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (C) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may revoke the ability of such
Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn
Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback). (D) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner from using any
amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided, that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 34 

Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital
related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement or (iii) as determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V 
 PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES 
 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . 
 (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in Section 5.4. (b)
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) means: (i) from any activity of
the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Interest for any accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related Investments described below), (x) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items that are
deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined as provided below); 
 (ii) from any GP-Related Investment for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such
 GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related

less (y) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. (c) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall
be determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxation and not
otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value in the books of the Partnership that differs from its
adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset in
the books of the Partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any
expenditures of the 
 35 

Partnership not deductible in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net
Income (Loss) pursuant to this definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom
interests in such GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership, Holdings and other Affiliates of the
Partnership shall be allocated among the Partnership, Holdings and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by
the General Partner. Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued
but not yet paid, unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items shall be made in accordance with GAAP;
 provided , that the General Partner shall not be required to make any such adjustment. (d) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal
Year, except that, at the option of the General Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not
the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments
as it deems appropriate to the Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of
 GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (e) In
establishing GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such
factors as it deems appropriate. (f) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting
purposes under this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners,
all Withdrawn Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership
or any successor thereto. 
 36 

Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital
Accounts . (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be
appropriate, one or more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the
 GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Interest and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related 
Capital Account ). (b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one or
more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or
Partners GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall
be credited with the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner
Interest during such accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital
related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate GP-Related Capital
Accounts of each Partner shall be debited with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of
any property distributed to such Partner during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and (y) the GP-Related Net
Loss allocated to such Partner for such accounting period. Section 5.3. GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages . (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the
profit sharing percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual
accounting period pursuant to Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (c) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately
prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end
of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. 
 37

Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided ,
that any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner
within 90 days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) . 
 (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related Investment of all the Partners
participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than
amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to Partners that received Non-Carried 
Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP-Related Net Income is
being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts
representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. 
 (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP Infrastructure IV and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on capital contributions made by
the Partnership to SP Infrastructure IV with respect to the GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s
 Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP Infrastructure IV and (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP Infrastructure IV and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s
(including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 38 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above,
 GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be
allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such
 GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period unrelated to SP Infrastructure IV, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such accounting period. (e) The
General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any
Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems
reasonably necessary for this purpose. Section 5.5. Liability of Partners . Except as otherwise provided in the
Partnership Act or as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall be personally obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner solely by reason of being a Partner. In no event shall any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner (i) be obligated to make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as
specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally Omitted] . 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investments as the General Partner may
determine. The General Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to
any Partner that is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other
requirements from time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 39 

Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or other
property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing
Percentages. (i) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP Infrastructure IV of a portion of
a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP Infrastructure IV) relating to a GP-Related Disposable
Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP Infrastructure IV) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income, and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 40 

(c) The General Partner may provide that the
 GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee (including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase
by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will
be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof (together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to
the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share
of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless
determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective
percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner;
 provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn
Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor
Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. 
 (d) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP Infrastructure IV a Clawback
Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to
such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as
determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund
GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate
Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of
Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investment giving rise to the
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an interest in the
 GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP
Infrastructure IV Agreement is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investment, 
 41 

all GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his
or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on
behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or
 Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ),
irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions;
 provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such
written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion
(but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate
amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the
General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. (A) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any
Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust
Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such
Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall
take such steps as are necessary to release such Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the
Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default
under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the SP Infrastructure IV
Partnership Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under
Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP Infrastructure
IV Partnership Agreement. 
 42 

(ii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting
Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such
amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the
Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e), no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to
contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 (A) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not
attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or
equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the
 GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 43 

(B) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first
seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution.
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute. 
 (iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating Losses (as defined in the SP
Infrastructure IV Agreements) on GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who
participated in such Loss Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related 
SP Infrastructure IV Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a
 GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP Infrastructure IV Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General
Partner shall calculate amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each
Partner s share of each such Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise
available for distribution to all Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP Infrastructure IV) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 44 

(B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise
distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP Infrastructure IV) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried
Interest Distributions and (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from
(II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income Tax Rate (as defined in the SP Infrastructure IV
Agreements) in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise
distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined
(as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net
Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be
allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. A
Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all
purposes hereof. A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject
to a Holdback, to the extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account
any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 45 

Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner,
including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such
amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried
Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be
contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses (as defined in the SP Infrastructure IV Agreements) in any GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investment with
respect to which Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 
 46 

It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the
Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP Infrastructure IV Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing and in accordance with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), the Partnership shall (i) calculate separate allocations attributable to (A) the Carried Interest and any other distribution entitlements that are not commensurate
with capital contributed to the Partnership, and (B) any distribution entitlements of the Partners that are commensurate with capital contributed to the Partnership (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B) and as reasonably determined by the General Partner), and (ii) consistently reflect each such allocation in its books and records. 
 (b) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and
local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable
law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its
respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated
shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are
in accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. (c) For U.S. federal, state
and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are
allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 5.10; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations
have substantial economic 
 47 

effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority
to any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an adjustment to any Partner s distributive share thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined
by the General Partner) in accordance with the final resolution of such audit adjustment. ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms of such additional Partner s
participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution,
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time
unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special Partner ).
Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the
General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or
subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a GP-Related 
Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. (b) The
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other
Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be
allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by
the General Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any further act, vote or consent of any person, to make adjustments to the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to other Partners of the
Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. 
 48 

(c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his or her pro
rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times
and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. (d) The
admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of this Agreement by such additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional
Partner, as determined by the General Partner, (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such
writing being acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership and/or (iv) the listing of such additional Partner in the books and records of the Partnership by the General Partner. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign
a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the Trust Agreement that is acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. 
 Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner, including if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business. Without
limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less
than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided, that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership
with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from
the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. 
 (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any
Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. (c) Upon the Total Disability of a
Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided, that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn
Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest as the
General Partner may determine. The determination of whether 
 49 

any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement between the
General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such person s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If the
General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such
notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. (e) The Withdrawal
from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the
Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. 
 Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not Transferable . 
 (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided, that this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by operation of
law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further, that, subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust, limited
partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting
Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to the Partnership (including the
obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require any Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the
Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or otherwise) of the whole
or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be given or withheld in its
sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a Partner of the Partnership. 
 50 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . 
 (a) Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its
right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute
General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided however, that the General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise)
and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of
liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner
and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as
contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or
more of such remaining Partners continue the business of the Partnership (any and all such remaining Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). Notwithstanding
Section 6.4(c), if upon the Withdrawal of a Partner there shall be no remaining Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be dissolved and shall be wound up unless, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Withdrawal, all remaining Special
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. 
 (c) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or
remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 51 

Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests . (a) The terms of this
Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner
Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner
Interest is retained as a Special Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date
for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall
be his or her Withdrawal Date; provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month
in which his or her Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained
a Partner of the Partnership during such period. (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). (e) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related 
 52 

Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related 
Investments or other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i)
below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement
Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment) and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest

above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership
pursuant to this Section 6.5. (f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s

accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. (h) [Intentionally
omitted.] (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the

subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date
of payment or distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the

in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or her
estate such deficiency, as the case may be.

Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of a security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with

settlement: (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any
 GP-Related Investment in which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized
Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn
Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her
 GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply
the provisions of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any
 GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as
of the Settlement Date (the balance of such GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 55 

(ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or
on or after the applicable date of payment or distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may
be conditioned on the compliance by such Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and
Affiliates for a period not exceeding two years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this
paragraph (n) may elect to forfeit the principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound
by such restrictions. (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than

Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. 
 (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to
Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such
professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 56 

(r) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General
Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make,

term at any time on not less than 60 days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance

all matters concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion. (a) The General Partner
shall cause to be prepared all federal, state and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns to be timely
filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several States
and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any and all elections
permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he or she shall not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit relating to his or her interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information statement
furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his or her income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of an income
tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any administrative or
judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his or her decision shall be
final and binding upon, the Partnership and all Partners except to the extent a Partner shall properly elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in connection therewith

Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership (unless he or she provides prior notice of such action
 
 57 

to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising out of or in connection with
any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such
amended return or claim for refund filed by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate
any Partner selected by the General Partner as the partnership representative (as defined under the Code) (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Partnership and all other Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.7 and
from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. 
 (b) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each federal, state and local income tax return of such Partner
(including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. (c) To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines
that the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership holds an interest) is or may be required by law to withhold or to make tax payments, including interest and penalties on such amounts, on behalf of or with respect to any Partner, or as a
result of a Partner s participation in the Partnership or as a result of a Partner s failure to provide requested tax information, including pursuant to Section 6225 or Section 1446(f) of the Code Tax
Advances ), the General Partner may withhold or escrow such amounts or make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner shall, at the option of the General Partner, (i) be promptly paid to the
Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such
distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for
repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the Partnership) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance.
To the extent that any taxes are imposed on the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership invests that is treated as a flow-through entity for relevant tax purposes) with respect to income of the Partnership (or such entity) in lieu of
taxes imposed directly on a Partner with respect to such income (including any state or local income taxes), whether by election of the Partnership or the General Partner or otherwise, such amounts shall be deemed to have been distributed to such
Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes,
penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from

or transfer of a Partnership interest permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the manner provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.754-1(b), to make an election to adjust the basis of the Partnership s property in the manner provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code. 
 ARTICLE VII CAPITAL COMMITMENT
INTERESTS; CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS 
 Section 7.1. Capital Commitment Interests, etc. 
 (a) This Article VII and Article VIII hereof set forth certain terms and conditions with respect to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests
and the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Interest and matters related to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VII or in
Article VIII, the terms and provisions of this Article VII and Article VIII shall not apply to the GP-Related Partner Interests or the GP-Related SP Infrastructure IV
Interest. (b) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related
Capital Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to SP Infrastructure IV in respect of the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP
Infrastructure IV Commitment, if any (including, without limitation, funding all or a portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment). No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in an
amount in excess of such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will
not necessarily participate in each Capital Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage
with respect to (i) the Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment, or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of
any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall
limit or dictate the terms upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s
Capital Commitment-Related Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 (c) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing Party may in its sole discretion advance to
any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions due to 
 59 

the Partnership from such Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Partner shall pay interest to the Advancing Party on each Firm
Advance from the date of such Firm Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the Advancing Party. The
making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error.
Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such rate upon such
Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of
Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed
the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
 
 60 

such Capital Commitment Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such
Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net
Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in
proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special
costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 7.7 shall be specially allocated to the electing Partner. 
 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to
the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments,
distributions to such Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including, without limitation, Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests)
during a Fiscal Year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such Fiscal Year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole discretion of the
General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected
by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): (i) First, to the
payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise) of such Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all
interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on income of
the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to the limitation that
the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an individual subject to the
then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes 
 61 

(including, without limitation, taxes imposed under Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character of such taxable income allocated by the Partnership and the limitations on
deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes); provided, that additional amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise
distributable to the Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further, that amounts paid
pursuant to the provisions in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BE Agreements that are comparable to this
clause (ii); (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any
Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year or (B) any BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources;
 (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in
respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Entity (other than the Partnership) in respect
of interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other
Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal
(including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of
payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital
Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the
Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the
Lender or Guarantor; and (vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income
remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 62 

To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other
BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest
payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate
thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in
respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or
other distribution remaining thereafter distributed to such Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any
other time at the discretion of the General Partner. At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal
payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period in respect of which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a Capital Commitment Investment
is being considered by the Partnership or SP Infrastructure IV (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to such Capital
Commitment Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
 
 63 

Class B Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment
Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class A Interests. (g) If the Partnership is obligated under the
Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP Infrastructure IV a Giveback Amount with respect to any Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being
herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner
and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Interest (the
 Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Investment giving rise to the Capital
Commitment Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Investments other than the one giving rise
to such obligation and (c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP Infrastructure IV Agreement is unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure IV Investment, all Capital Commitment SP
Infrastructure IV Investments. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s
discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate
amount of such obligations). (i) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails
to recontribute all or any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment
Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment
Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution
be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith
 
 64 

judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered
relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to
the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the
Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment
from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name
of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (A) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (ii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the
Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5. Valuations .
Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any other Affiliate of the
Partnership that is a general partner of SP Infrastructure IV) in valuing investments of SP Infrastructure IV or, in the case of investments not held by SP Infrastructure IV, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to
the second proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as
set forth above; provided, that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further, that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take
into account factors relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment
Interest and lack of control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further, that the immediately preceding proviso shall
not apply to any Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member or partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. 
 65 

Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such
Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the
Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not
be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to
or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. ARTICLE VIII 
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as
 Non-Contingent for purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment
Interest and principal payments on the related 
 66 

Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal
amount of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided, that
in the event that a Partner prepays all or any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, the Partnership
(or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further, that the purchase price
for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Partner
shall apply pro rata against all of such Partner s Investor Notes; provided, that such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Entities
specified by such Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent Capital Commitment
Interests. (b) Upon a Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of
such Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its
designee(s) within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership (subject to the prior consent of the General
Partner, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by
the Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 (i) The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be an amount equal to (A) the
outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to be repurchased, plus (y) all
Capital Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such
Capital Commitment Interest; provided, that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General
Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income
received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment 
 67 

Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative, it shall be payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next
Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or
(B) if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase;
provided, that the Partnership and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear
interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. 
 (ii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an officer or employee, all Investor Notes shall become fully recourse to the
Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). 
 (iii) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of
such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn
Partner in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the Partnership shall apply such
prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. (iv) To the extent that another Partner purchases a
portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly
increased. (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with
respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the
Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner
Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time,
in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of
law or otherwise and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in
 
 68 

the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal
or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. (d) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability) (and the purchase
price for such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal representative or other Successor in
Interest, in cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, so requests in
writing within 180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year),
the Partnership or its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as of the last day of the
Partnership s then current Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his or her will
to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, within 30 days of the
first date on which the General Partner knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in
Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment
Value thereof. (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Partner with respect to any
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an employee or officer of the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn
Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Partner or another Affiliate of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined in 
 69 

good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase). The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to
paragraph (d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 (f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as
described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or
a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such
repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest
relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment
Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or
(ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse
basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree; provided, that such indebtedness shall become fully
recourse to the extent and at the time provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be non-recourse or so limited, the Partnership may require an
assumption by the Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Partners; provided, that a Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor
Note(s), be obligated to accept any obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this Section 8.1), unless his or her prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment
Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to
which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion
his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such
proportions. 
 70 

(g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1;
 provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement:
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interest); (ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain such
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment
shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof;
or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory
note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. (h) The Partnership will assist a
Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to
retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or
guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to
interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without
limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 71 

Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment
Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided, that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a
Withdrawn Partner s or Deceased or Totally Disabled Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another
Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without
giving any reason therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning
Vehicle (it being understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General
Partner in connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General
Partner shall designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Partner and
such Nonvoting Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate
Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such
Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or
the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital
Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws.

 72 

(b) upon the expiration of the term of the Partnership. 
 Section 9.2. Final Distribution . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, and following the payment of creditors of the
Partnership and the making of provisions for the payment of any contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the Partnership as required under the Partnership Act: 
 (a) The Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the GP-Related Capital Account
balances of the Partners; and (b) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to
such Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment
Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment;
and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. The General Partner shall be the liquidator. In the
event that the General Partner is unable to serve as liquidator, a liquidating trustee shall be chosen by the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Partners voting at a meeting of Partners (excluding Nonvoting Special Partners). 
 Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner Interests . 
 (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner
Interests which, in the judgment of the liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in each such
Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro
rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the liquidator shall determine. 
 (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to
such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may
meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on
account of such transaction or claim. 
 73 

(c) Upon determination by the liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion
of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such
Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld.

have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such
invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act
or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Blackstone Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ), a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and
that the ownership of, and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors,
successors or assigns) has licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the permission
of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and its
Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such termination, the
Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service mark or otherwise.

entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners, officers or employees with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, benefits or any
other matter, which letter agreements have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing, the terms of this Agreement with respect to any such Partner and such matters. The parties hereto agree that any rights established, or
any terms of this Agreement altered or supplemented, in any such separate letter agreement, including any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, shall govern solely with respect to such Partner notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.
The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever; provided,
that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. Section 10.5. Governing
Law , Separability of Provisions . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been formed
pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be
given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. 
 Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to
the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided, that no person
claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on
any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this
Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based on the standards set forth in Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and Section 7.4(g)(ii)(A),
to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns.

provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligations relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner and each such Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing,

provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its substantial 
 78

determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority
granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of legal counsel to the Partnership, accountants and other experts or professional advisors, and no action taken by any
Covered Person in reliance on such advice shall in any event subject such person to any liability to any Partner or the Partnership. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating
thereto to the Partnership or to another Partner, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such Partner acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any such other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of

Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person s management of the affairs of the Partnership or which relate to or arise out of or in connection with the Partnership, its
property, its business or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of any act or omission of such Covered Person constituting Cause); provided , that a
Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5(b) with respect to any claim, issue or matter if there is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or

Covered Person (including, without limitation, the General Partner) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval of the General Partner, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final
disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered

Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation
hereunder, such Partner shall be responsible, up to the amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining capital commitments, for such Partner s pro rata share of the Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation,
as determined by the General Partner. The Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be
personally obligated with respect to indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify
pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty, it is
understood and/or agreed that the Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable law
governing SP IX and/or a particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the following
order of priority: first , out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP IX; second , by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment is
indirectly held; and third , by SP IX (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted).

expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP IX and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies
maintained thereby), and to the extent the Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP IX and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance
policies maintained thereby), it is agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP IX and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be
specifically empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may
determine necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing. Section 3.6. Representations of

and conditions hereof as provided herein or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Partner is acquiring each of such Partner s

business matters, that such Partner is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, and that such Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents

in Interests. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of the Partner, the Partner has been furnished any materials that such Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment and the offering
of Interests and has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other
additional information relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and
related matters concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner. 
 25

SP IX Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any, or otherwise; provided, that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing
Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business operations (as distinct from
financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General Partner. Special Partners shall not be required to make
additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an increase in such
Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided , that the General Partner and any Special Partner may agree from time to
time that such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided further , that each Investor Special Partner shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total capital

(b) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership
to loan any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any

certain amounts of the distributions relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a
 Holdback ). The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld
percentage constituting the General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than the
General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than the General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback
Percentage for the General Partner and/or Holdings shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). 
 (ii) The Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her
Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is

Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any
individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the
General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback
Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to 24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any
increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the
Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased
Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 28 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General
Partner may increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback Vote 
 provided , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and
(y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such
decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or
assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not
be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. 
 (A) A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote
with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 
 (B) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject
Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually
satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided 
 further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject
Partner that submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected
 out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator,
pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with
such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount 
 29 

contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to
cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party shall be the Partnership if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the
second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party
shall be the losing party. (C) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage
(1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and
the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback
Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the Excess
Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust
Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging, granting a
security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner
seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a
first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s books and records in which
Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority
security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a second priority security interest therein in the manner
provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or (y) if the General Partner
otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the 
 30 

Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed
in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the
request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. 
 (A) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral
Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm
Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization,
if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default
under this clause (C); provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such
term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon
which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership to
distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an 
 31 

L/C for the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C
Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a
 Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a
commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP IX, the
Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date
of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is
necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal
to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as
directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C
Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners
or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts
in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any
amount. (vii) Any in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried
Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any
time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. (A) In lieu of the
foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s
books and records; provided , that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall initially 
 32 

equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special
Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount
from the Trust Account. (viii) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his or her
Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a
release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) by pledging or granting a security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback
distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is
necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (A) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess
Holdback) is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust
Account)), then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or
other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes
hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a
Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
deficiency with respect to his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. 
 33 

(B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or
any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such
deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party 
where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (C) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may revoke the ability of such
Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn
Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback). (D) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner from using any
amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided , that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or (iii) as
determined by the General Partner.

 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . 
 (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in Section 5.4. (b)
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) means: (i) from any activity of
the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP IX Interest for any accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments described below), (x) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items
that are deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined as provided below); 
 (ii) from any GP-Related Investment for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such
 GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related 
Investment (determined as provided below); and (iii) from any GP-Related 
Investment for the accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment is sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period
less (y) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. (c) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall
be determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxation and not
otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value in the books of the Partnership that differs from its
adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset in
the books of the Partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any
expenditures of the Partnership not deductible in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this
definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in such GP-Related 
 35 

Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership, Holdings and other Affiliates of the Partnership shall be
allocated among the Partnership, Holdings and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner.
Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid,
unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items shall be made in accordance with GAAP; provided , that the
General Partner shall not be required to make any such adjustment. (d) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal Year, except that, at the
option of the General Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal
Year. If any event referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to
the Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated
Percentages or adjustments to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages during such accounting period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such
 GP-Related Investment was acquired. (e) In establishing
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate. (f) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under
this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all Withdrawn
Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any
successor thereto. Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be appropriate, one or
more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP IX Interest
and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ). 
 36 

(b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the
Partnership by one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such
Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each
Partner shall be credited with the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest during such accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the
interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate
 GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be debited with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in
Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any property distributed to such Partner during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and
(y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated to such Partner for such accounting period. 
 Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages . 
 (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting period pursuant to
Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such
 GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (c) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately
prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end
of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. (b) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of
the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of any category for any annual accounting period at the time specified in Section 5.3(a) for the annual fixing of
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a
 GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided , that any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category
 
 37 

of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner within 90 days after the end of such
accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) . 
 (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related Investment of all the Partners
participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than
amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to Partners that received Non-Carried 
Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP-Related Net Income is
being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts
representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. 
 (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP IX and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on capital contributions made by the Partnership
to SP IX with respect to the GP-Related SP IX Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage
with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP IX and (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP IX and
allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s (including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above,
 GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be
allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such
 GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. 
 38 

(d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related 
Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period unrelated to SP IX, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such accounting period. (e) The General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to
Partners (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such
allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 5.5. Liability of Partners . Except as otherwise provided in the Partnership Act or as expressly provided in this
Agreement, no Partner shall be personally obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner solely by reason of being a Partner. In no event shall any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (i) be obligated to
make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or
Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally Omitted] . 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP IX Investments as the General Partner may determine. The General
Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that is
Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or other
property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing
Percentages. 
 39 

(i) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP
IX of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General
Partner each Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s
 GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP IX) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP IX) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such
 GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income, and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be 
 40 

withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof (together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s
rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership
distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability
or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such
time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in
proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related 
Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment
attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related 
Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such
unrealized investment income. (d) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to
SP IX a Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP IX Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to
such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as
determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund
GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate
Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of
Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP IX Investment giving rise to the
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP IX Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP IX
Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP IX Agreement is unrelated to a specific
 GP-Related SP IX Investment, all GP-Related SP IX Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his
or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on
behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or
 Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback 
 41 

Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on
an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the
amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s
judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a
Partner s Trust Account used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust
Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. 
 (A) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment
hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the SP IX Partnership Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall have the
same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro rata 
share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP IX Partnership Agreement. 
 42 

(ii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other
Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a
 GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from
such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date
that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e),
no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 (A) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not
attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or
equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the
 GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 43 

(B) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first
seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution.
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute. 
 (iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating Losses (as defined in the SP IX
Agreements) on GP-Related SP IX Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments
based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related SP IX Investments. Consequently and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a
 GP-Related SP IX Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP IX Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall calculate amounts
distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share of each such Loss
Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution to all
Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP IX) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 (B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject
Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP IX) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and 
 (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest
Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 44 

To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this
clause (i) is a negative number, the General Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership
prior Carried Interest distributions (a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to
clause (I) are insufficient to satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest
Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income
Tax Rate (as defined in the SP IX Agreements) in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such
Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of
Carried Interest otherwise distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the
Clawback Amount is determined (as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent
there is an amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried
Interest Distribution shall be allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. 
 A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as
provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. A Partner
may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to
the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 45 

Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner,
including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such
amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried
Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be
contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses (as defined in the SP IX Agreements) in any GP-Related SP IX Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP IX Investment with respect to which Carried Interest
distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP IX Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of
each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP IX Agreements. 
 46 

Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the
Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with the principles and requirements of
Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing and in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), the Partnership shall
(i) calculate separate allocations attributable to (A) the Carried Interest and any other distribution entitlements that are not commensurate with capital contributed to the Partnership, and (B) any distribution entitlements of the
Partners that are commensurate with capital contributed to the Partnership (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B) and as reasonably determined by the
General Partner), and (ii) consistently reflect each such allocation in its books and records. (b) All items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners
pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with
the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections
 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are in
accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. (c) For U.S. federal, state
and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are
allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 5.10; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations
have substantial economic effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority to any item of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an adjustment to any Partner s distributive share thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined by the General Partner) in
accordance with the final resolution of such audit adjustment.

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms of such additional Partner s
participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution,
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time
unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special
Partner ). Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note
approved by the General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or
such other or subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a
 GP-Related Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. 
 (b) The GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of
the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General
Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other
Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any
further act, vote or consent of any person, to make adjustments to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners
admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to other Partners of the Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. 
 48 

(c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his or her pro
rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times
and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. (d) The
admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of this Agreement by such additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional
Partner, as determined by the General Partner, (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such
writing being acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership and/or (iv) the listing of such additional Partner in the books and records of the Partnership by the General Partner. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign
a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the Trust Agreement that is acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. 
 Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner, including if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business. Without
limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less
than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided , that a Partner may Withdraw from the
Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may
Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest.
 (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any
Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. (c) Upon the Total Disability of a
Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided , that the General Partner may elect to admit such
Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest
as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of
agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 49 

(d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the
Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with
respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after
the date of such notice. If the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital
Commitment Partner Interest, such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. 
 (e) The Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue
the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the
fullest extent provided by law. Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not
Transferable . (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any
portion of such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided , that this Section 6.3 shall not impair
transfers by operation of law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further , that, subject to the prior
written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to
any estate planning trust, limited partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each
Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with
respect to the Partnership (including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require any
Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance,

consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a Partner of the Partnership.

 Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . 
 (a) Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its
right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute
General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided however , that the General Partner may,
in its sole discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or
otherwise) and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such
person of liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General
Partner and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon
the collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as
contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or
more of such remaining Partners continue the business of the Partnership (any and all such remaining Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). Notwithstanding
Section 6.4(c), if upon the Withdrawal of a Partner there shall be no remaining Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be dissolved and shall be wound up unless, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Withdrawal, all remaining Special
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. 
 (c) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or
remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interests . (a) The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For
purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP- 
 51 

Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all
or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Special Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. 
 (b) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner
Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his or her Withdrawal Date; provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not
the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month in which his or her Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s
Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained a Partner of the Partnership during such period. 
 (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). (e) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be 
 52 

entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related 
Investment) and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in
paragraph (f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an
aggregate negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided , that if the
Withdrawn Partner was solely a Special Partner on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative balance in the
 GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Special Partner, upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in
the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the General Partner as of
such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or
the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 (i) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described
below, to receive a Nonvoting Special Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than
all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Investor Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. The election referred to
above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership
pursuant to this Section 6.5. (f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s
 percentage interest means his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn
Partner shall retain his or her percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable
to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn Partner shall become and remain a Special Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so
designates, such Special Partner shall be a Nonvoting Special Partner). The GP-Related Partner Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole
discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that
the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to this sentence.

 pro rata share (as determined by the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other
investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the
Partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. 
 (h) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of

the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of
payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or
distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of

 (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should prove,
in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or her
estate such deficiency, as the case may be. 
 54

 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of a security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with

 GP-Related Investment in which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized
Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn
Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her
 GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply
the provisions of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any
 GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The
Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 55 

(ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or

be conditioned on the compliance by such Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and
Affiliates for a period not exceeding two years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this
paragraph (n) may elect to forfeit the principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound
by such restrictions. (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than
the General Partner) a discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant.

 (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to
Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such
professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (r) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful
agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner,

 56 

transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5, including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise
of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall
not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. Section 6.6. Dissolution of the Partnership . The
General Partner may dissolve the Partnership prior to the expiration of its term at any time on not less than 60 days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the

treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any
such item or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he or
she shall not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his or her interest in the
Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in
preparing his or her income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of an income tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the

 57 

otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the
Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as
the partnership representative (as defined under the Code) (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other
Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.7 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. 
 (b) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each federal, state and local income tax return of such Partner
(including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. (c) To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines
that the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership holds an interest) is or may be required by law to withhold or to make tax payments, including interest and penalties on such amounts, on behalf of or with respect to any Partner, or as a
result of a Partner s participation in the Partnership or as a result of a Partner s failure to provide requested tax information, including pursuant to Section 6225 or Section 1446(f) of the Code Tax
Advances ), the General Partner may withhold or escrow such amounts or make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner shall, at the option of the General Partner, (i) be promptly paid to the
Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such
distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for
repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the Partnership) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance.
To the extent that any taxes are imposed on the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership invests that is treated as a flow-through entity for relevant tax purposes) with respect to income of the Partnership (or such entity) in lieu of
taxes imposed directly on a Partner with respect to such income (including any state or local income taxes), whether by election of the Partnership or the General Partner or otherwise, such amounts shall be deemed to have been distributed to such
Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties,
additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from the
Partnership or any Transfer of a Partner s interest.

 (b) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to SP IX in respect of the Capital Commitment SP IX Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP IX Commitment, if any (including, without
limitation, funding all or a portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment). No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in an amount in excess of such Partner s Capital
Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each Capital
Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the
Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment, or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or
SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms
upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related
Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 (c) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing Party may in its sole discretion advance to
any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions due to the Partnership from such Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Partner shall pay interest to the Advancing Party on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm
Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon 
 59 

prior written notice by the Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive
evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of
the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such rate upon such Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law;
 provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change
the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to such terms and
(ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. 
 Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the 
 60 

election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital Commitment
Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment Investment. 
 (b) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 7.7 shall be specially allocated to the electing
Partner. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give
economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments,
distributions to such Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including, without limitation, Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests)
during a Fiscal Year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such Fiscal Year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole discretion of the
General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected
by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): (i) First, to the
payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise) of such Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all
interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on income of
the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to the limitation that
the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an individual subject to the
then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes (including, without limitation, taxes imposed under Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character of such taxable income allocated by the
Partnership and the limitations on deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes); provided , that additional amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this
 
 61 

clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient
amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further , that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall
reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BE Agreements that are comparable to this clause (ii); 
 (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital Commitment
Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year or (B) any BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; 
 (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in respect of
the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Entity (other than the Partnership) in respect of
interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other
Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal
(including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of
payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital
Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the
Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the
Lender or Guarantor; and (vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income
remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate
 
 62 

thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1
hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor
Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed to such Partner. 
 Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the discretion of the General Partner. At the General
Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period in respect of
which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a Capital Commitment Investment
is being considered by the Partnership or SP IX (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to such Capital Commitment
Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment
shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
Class A Interests. 
 63 

(g) If the Partnership is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP IX a
Giveback Amount with respect to any Capital Commitment SP IX Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the
General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and
as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP IX Interest (the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s
 pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP IX Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are
insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP IX Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation and (c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP IX Agreement
is unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment SP IX Investment, all Capital Commitment SP IX Investments. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount.
Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment
Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). (i) In the event
any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall
(i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital
Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a
 Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment
of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital
Commitment Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner
shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good
faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not
ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the 
 64 

Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as
appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner
hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the
Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may
be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such
Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (A) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (ii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the
Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5. Valuations .
Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any other Affiliate of the
Partnership that is a general partner of SP IX) in valuing investments of SP IX or, in the case of investments not held by SP IX, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the immediately
succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided , that
the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further , that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors
relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of
control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further , that the immediately preceding proviso shall not
apply to any Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member or partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. 
 Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 65 

(a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive
agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment, the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such
Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or
any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such
disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such
Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent
disposition thereof by the Partnership. (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating
thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment
Special Distribution Election . (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole
discretion, upon receipt of a written request from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in
such Capital Commitment Investment) (a Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to
or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. ARTICLE VIII 
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as
 Non-Contingent for purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment
Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount
of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided , that
in the event that a Partner prepays all or any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior 
 66 

to the date on which such Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, the Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further , that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be
determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Partner shall apply pro rata against all of such
Partner s Investor Notes; provided , that such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Entities specified by such Partner. Except as
expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 (b) Upon a Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such Partner
dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s)
within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership (subject to the prior consent of the General Partner, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by the Partnership
or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. (i)
The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be an amount equal to (A) the outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the
purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the
portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to be repurchased, plus (y) all Capital Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus
(z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest; provided , that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an
officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the
purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital
Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative, it shall be payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or (B) if the Partnership or its
designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in 
 67 

cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided , that the Partnership and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a Withdrawn Partner against any
Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, his or her related
Investor Note shall be payable in full. (ii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an officer or employee, all Investor
Notes shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of the Withdrawn Partner s
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). (iii) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s)
exercises the right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding,
shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his or her
option, and the Partnership shall apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. (iv) To
the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital
Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such
Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed
to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect
to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or
Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time, in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in
Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until
distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal
or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. 
 68 

(d) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital Commitment
Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability) (and the purchase price for such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in
cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such Contingent
Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, so requests in writing within
180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership
or its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then current
Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his or her will to reflect such provisions of
this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, within 30 days of the first date on which the General
Partner knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the
Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. 
 (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an employee or officer of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon
30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership
or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself
another Partner or another Affiliate of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital
Commitment Value thereof (determined in good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase). The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph
(d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 69 

(f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or
portion thereof which is purchased by it as described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General
Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the
foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or
purchased by another person, all or any portion of such repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to
which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the
Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to
Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or (ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be
deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for
such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree;
 provided , that such indebtedness shall become fully recourse to the extent and at the time provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be
 non-recourse or so limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to
such Partners; provided , that a Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor Note(s), be obligated to accept any obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this Section 8.1), unless his or her prior
consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness
financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income
(Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt
service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. (g) If a Partner
is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs
 (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1; provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not
be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 70 

(i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of
such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest); (ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain
such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment
shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof;
or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory
note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. (h) The Partnership will assist a
Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to
retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or
guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to
interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without
limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General
Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest in the

Partnership; provided , that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn
Partner s or Deceased or Totally Disabled Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason
therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning Vehicle (it being
understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General Partner in
connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General Partner shall
designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Partner and such
Nonvoting Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate
Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such
Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or
the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital
Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 ARTICLE IX DISSOLUTION 
 Section 9.1. Dissolution . The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (a) pursuant to Section 6.6; or 
 (b) upon the expiration of the term of the Partnership. 
 Section 9.2. Final Distribution . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, and following the payment of creditors of the
Partnership and the making of provisions for the payment of any contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the Partnership as required under the Partnership Act: 
 (a) The Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the GP-Related Capital Account
balances of the Partners; and 
 72 

(b) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall
be paid to such Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital
Commitment Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment
Investment; and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages for each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. The General Partner shall be the
liquidator. In the event that the General Partner is unable to serve as liquidator, a liquidating trustee shall be chosen by the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Partners voting at a meeting of Partners (excluding Nonvoting Special
Partners). Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner Interests . 
 (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner
Interests which, in the judgment of the liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in each such
Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro
rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the liquidator shall determine. 
 (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to
such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may
meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on
account of such transaction or claim. (c) Upon determination by the liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion of any
Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such Securities
or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld.

ARTICLE X 
 MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably,
including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including
the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as any and all disputes arising out of, relating to or in connection with the termination, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership), whether arising during the
existence of the Partnership or at or after its termination or during or after the liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York U.S.A., in accordance
with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the
International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration
proceedings. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may cause the Partnership to bring,
on behalf of the General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary
relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this Section 10.1 to any such
action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably
appoints the General Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who shall promptly advise such Partner of any such service of
process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Partner in any such action or proceeding. (b) EACH
PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or
preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the forum(s) designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties 
relationship with one another. 
 74 

(i) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, any objection which they now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such
parties agree not to plead or claim the same. (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1
shall be construed to the maximum extent possible to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If,
nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware
Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within
the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Blackstone Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ), a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and
that the ownership of, and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors,
successors or assigns) has licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the permission of TM. All services rendered by the
Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership
understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such termination, the Partnership will take all steps necessary to
change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service mark or otherwise. 
 Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a vote of Partners at a meeting may be taken
without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. Section 10.4. Letter Agreements;
Schedules . The General Partner may, or may cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners, officers or employees with respect to
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, benefits or any other matter, which letter agreements have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or
supplementing, the terms of 
 75 

this Agreement with respect to any such Partner and such matters. The parties hereto agree that any rights established, or any terms of this Agreement altered or supplemented, in any such
separate letter agreement, including any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, shall govern solely with respect to such Partner notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement. The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to
the Partners schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed
appropriate by the General Partner. Such schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever; provided , that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any
Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. Section 10.5. Governing Law , Separability of Provisions .
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware , without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the
rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum extent
permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns;
Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any
successor to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided , that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner
itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI
and Article VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution
Amounts) of any transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith
judgment, based on the standards set forth in Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and Section 7.4(g)(ii)(A), to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or
Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than
the Partners and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the SP IX Agreements, (x) the limited partners in SP IX shall be third-party
beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in Section 9.4(a) of the
SP IX Partnership Agreement) and (y) the amendment of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence,
as defined in Section 9.4(a) of the SP IX Partnership Agreement), in a manner materially adverse to such limited partners shall be effective against such limited partners only with the 66 2 3 Combined Limited Partner Consent (as such term is used in the SP IX Partnership Agreement). 
 76 

Section 10.7. Confidentiality . 
 (a) By executing this Agreement, each Partner expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or
not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than the Partnership, another Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business,
financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally known to the public or the securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided , that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law, rule, regulation or custom to disclose. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee, representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding (a) the
Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any performance information relating to any of the Partners or their
investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax structure information. 
 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or impede any Partner from communicating, cooperating or filing a complaint on possible
violations of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation to or with any governmental agency or regulatory authority (collectively, a Governmental Entity ), including, but not limited to, the SEC, FINRA, EEOC or NLRB, or from
making other disclosures to any Governmental Entity that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation; provided , that in each case such communications and disclosures are consistent with
applicable law. Each Partner understands and acknowledges that (a) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any U.S. federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in
confidence to a U.S. federal, state, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other
proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (b) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade
secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Moreover, a Partner shall not be required to give prior
notice to (or get prior authorization from) Blackstone regarding any such communication or disclosure. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or under applicable law, under no circumstance is any Partner authorized to disclose any
information covered by Blackstone or its affiliates attorney-client privilege or attorney work product or Blackstone s trade secrets without the prior written consent of Blackstone. 
 Section 10.8. Notices . Whenever notice is required or permitted by this Agreement to be given, such notice shall be in
writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be given by hand delivery (including any courier service) or telecopy to any Partner at its address or telecopy number shown in the Partnership s books and records or, if given to the
General Partner, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch and (ii) if given by hand delivery, when delivered to the address of such
Partner, the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. 
 77 

Section 10.9. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute a single instrument. For the avoidance of doubt, a Person s execution and delivery of this Agreement by electronic signature and electronic transmission
(jointly, an Electronic Signature ), including via DocuSign or other similar method, shall constitute the execution and delivery of a counterpart of this Agreement by or on behalf of such Person and shall bind such Person to the
terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement and any additional information incidental hereto may be maintained as electronic records. Any Person executing and delivering this Agreement by an Electronic Signature further
agrees to take any and all reasonable additional actions, if any, evidencing its intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, as may be reasonably requested by the General Partner. 
 Section 10.10. Power of Attorney . Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true
and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file all instruments, documents and certificates which, from time to
time, may be required to set forth any amendment to this Agreement or may be required by this Agreement or by the laws of the United States of America, the State of Delaware or any other state in which the Partnership shall determine to do business,
or any political subdivision or agency thereof, to execute, implement and continue the valid and subsisting existence of the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding the subsequent Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 10.11. Partner s Will . Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall include in his or her will a
provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligations relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner and each such Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing,
that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Interest is transferred shall include a
provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its substantial equivalent remains in such trust. In the event any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.11 after the Partnership has notified such Partner or Withdrawn Partner of his or her failure to so comply and such failure to so comply is not cured within 30 days of such notice,
the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Partner until the time at which such party complies with the requirements of this Section 10.11. 
 Section 10.12. Cumulative Remedies . Rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and do not preclude use of other
rights and remedies available under applicable law. 
 78 

Section 10.13. Legal Fees . Except as more specifically provided herein, in
the event of a legal dispute (including litigation, arbitration or mediation) between any Partner or Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership, arising in connection with any party seeking to enforce Section 4.1(d) or any other provision of this
Agreement relating to the Holdback, the Clawback Amount, the GP-Related Giveback Amount, the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount
or the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount, the losing party to such dispute shall promptly reimburse the victorious party for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute (such
determination to be made by the relevant adjudicator). Any amounts due under this Section 10.13 shall be paid within 30 days of the date upon which such amounts are due to be paid and such amounts remaining unpaid after such date shall accrue
interest at the Default Interest Rate. Section 10.14. Entire Agreement ; Modifications . This Agreement embodies
the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or
referred to herein. Subject to Section 10.4, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Except as provided herein, this Agreement may be amended or modified at any
time by the General Partner in its sole discretion, upon notification thereof to the Limited Partners. 
 Section 10.15. Section Titles . The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience and reference purposes only and
shall not be deemed to alter or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement. 
 79 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the day and
year first above written. In the event that it is impracticable to obtain the signature of any one or more of the Partners to this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding among the other Partners executing the same.

particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the following order of priority:

payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates,
which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing.

Partner is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, and that such Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that such Partner s
overall commitment to the Partnership and other investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Partner s net worth and the Partner has no need for liquidity in the Partner s investment in Interests. Each
Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of the Partner, the Partner has been furnished any materials that such Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and
has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information
relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning
an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner. 
 (b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be
true and correct as of any date that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that

ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the
Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required
to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP RE VIII in respect of the GP-Related SP RE VIII Interest with respect to any GP-Related 
SP RE VIII Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any, or otherwise; provided, that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing
Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business operations (as distinct from
financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General Partner. Special Partners shall not be required to make
additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an increase in such
Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner and any Special Partner may agree from time to time that
such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided, further, that each Investor Special Partner shall maintain its
 GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total
capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE VIII Interest. (a) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to
Section 5.10. (b) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner
(including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any
 GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any
Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by
the General Partner. (c) (i) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which
certain amounts of the distributions relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a
 Holdback ). The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld
percentage constituting the General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than the
General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than the General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback
Percentage for the General Partner and/or Holdings shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). 
 28 

(ii) The Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner
as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the
Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall
apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. (iii) The Holdback
Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners 
Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the
General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to 24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies
equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner
from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners,
Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 (iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General Partner may increase or decrease the Holdback
Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback Vote provided , that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage
shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner,
been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the
prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such
Partner s 
 29 

good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or assigns (including such
Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of
satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. (A) A
Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast
by any such Partner in person or by proxy. (B) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided, that if the Partnership and the Subject
Partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such
candidates; provided further, that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator.
Each Subject Partner that submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected
 out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator,
pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with
such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is
insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party
shall be the Partnership if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner
Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (C) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect 
 30 

to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such
reduced Holdback Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the Excess
Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust
Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging, granting a
security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner
seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a
first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s books and records in which
Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority
security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a second priority security interest therein in the manner
provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or (y) if the General Partner
otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause
(x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral
Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is
necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. (A) If upon a sale or
other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to
100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including 
 31 

distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm
Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization,
if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this
clause (C); provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon
which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership to
distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term
deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by
S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall
supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a
date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP RE VIII, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at
 
 32 

least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any
L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s
obligations under the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral
(to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon
(1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral
(to the extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback
obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category
of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 (vii) Any in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall
be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net
proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. (A) In lieu of the foregoing,
any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s books and
records; provided, that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections 4.1(d)(viii)(C)
and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may
obtain a release of such excess amount from the Trust Account. (viii) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy
all or any portion of his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C
as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall 
 33 

remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging
or granting a security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or
Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the
good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (A) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback)
is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust Account)), then
up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net
proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes
Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to
his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. (B) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any
adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such
deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed
 
 34 

inapplicable to such default; provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term
 GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C). (C) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the
General Partner may revoke the ability of such Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause
(C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion
of the Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback). (D) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner from using any amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided, that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or (iii) as
determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V 
 PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES 
 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . 
 (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in Section 5.4. 
 35 

(b) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) 
means: (i) from any activity of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE
VIII Interest for any accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related Investments described below), (x) the gross income realized by the
Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items that are deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined as
provided below); (ii) from any GP-Related Investment for any accounting period in
which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment
(determined as provided below); and (iii) from any GP-Related Investment for the
accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment is sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such
 GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting
period less (y) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. (c) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall
be determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxation and not
otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value in the books of the Partnership that differs from its
adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset in
the books of the Partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any
expenditures of the Partnership not deductible in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this
definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in such GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership, Holdings and other Affiliates of the Partnership shall be
allocated among the Partnership, Holdings and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner.
Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid,
unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items shall be made in accordance with GAAP; provided , that the
General Partner shall not be required to make any such adjustment. 
 36 

(d) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal Year, except that, at the option of the General
Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event
referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to the Partners 
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments
to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting
period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (e) In establishing
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate. (f) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under
this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all Withdrawn
Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any
successor thereto. Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be appropriate, one or
more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE VIII
Interest and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ). 
 (b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one or more of the Partners with respect
to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners 
 GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited
with the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest
during such accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related
to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of
each Partner shall be debited with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any property
distributed to such Partner during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and (y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated
to such Partner for such accounting period.

Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages . (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing
percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting
period pursuant to Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (c) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately
prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end
of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. (b) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of
the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of any category for any annual accounting period at the time specified in Section 5.3(a) for the annual fixing of
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a
 GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided , that any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner within 90 days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the
Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. (c) Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such
 GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the
General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 38 

Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related 
Net Income (Loss) . (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net
Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such
 GP-Related Investment of all the Partners participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the
amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to
Partners that received Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the
years such GP-Related Net Income is being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of
 GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the
same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed
if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the
Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP RE VIII and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof
(based on capital contributions made by the Partnership to SP RE VIII with respect to the GP-Related SP RE VIII Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP RE VIII and
 (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP RE VIII and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s
(including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above, GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest
allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as
the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in
accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. 
 (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period
unrelated to SP RE VIII, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such
accounting period. (e) The General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner
admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net
Income (Loss). 
 39 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems
reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 5.5. Liability of Partners . Except as otherwise provided in the Partnership Act or as expressly provided in this
Agreement, no Partner shall be personally obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner solely by reason of being a Partner. In no event shall any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (i) be obligated to
make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or
Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally Omitted] . 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP RE VIII Investments as the General Partner may determine. The
General Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that
is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or other
property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing
Percentages. 
 40 

(i) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP
RE VIII of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the
General Partner each Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s
 GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RE VIII) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RE VIII) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such
 GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income, and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof
(together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the
applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have 
 41 

the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the
Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall
be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests
in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in
such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. (d) If the Partnership
is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP RE VIII a Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the
 GP-Related SP RE VIII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related 
Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to
the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried 
Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a
Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with
(a) the GP-Related SP RE VIII Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are
insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP RE VIII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts
received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP RE VIII Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount
pursuant to an applicable SP RE VIII Agreement is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP RE VIII Investment, all GP-Related SP RE VIII Investments. Each Partner and
Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if
applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs 
obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; 
 42 

provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the
 GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as
reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential
obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account
used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days
after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. 
 (A) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment
hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the SP RE VIII Partnership Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall have
the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro
rata share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP RE VIII Partnership Agreement. 
 (ii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related Defaulting
Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General
Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro
 
 43 

rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a
 GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from
such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date
that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e),
no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 (A) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not
attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or
equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the
 GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 44 

(B) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first
seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution.
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute. 
 (iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating Losses (as defined in the SP RE VIII
Agreements) on GP-Related SP RE VIII Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments
based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related SP RE VIII Investments. Consequently
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a
 GP-Related SP RE VIII Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP RE VIII Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall
calculate amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share of
each such Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution
to all Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RE VIII) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 (B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject
Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RE VIII) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and 
 45 

(C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from
(II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income Tax Rate (as defined in the SP RE VIII
Agreements) in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise
distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined
(as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net
Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be
allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. A
Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all
purposes hereof. A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject
to a Holdback, to the extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account
any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 46 

Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner,
including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such
amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried
Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be
contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses (as defined in the SP RE VIII Agreements) in any GP-Related SP RE VIII Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP RE VIII Investment with respect to which
Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP RE VIII Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 
 47 

It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the
Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP RE VIII Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing and in accordance with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), the Partnership shall (i) calculate separate allocations attributable to (A) the Carried Interest and any other distribution entitlements that are not commensurate
with capital contributed to the Partnership, and (B) any distribution entitlements of the Partners that are commensurate with capital contributed to the Partnership (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B) and as reasonably determined by the General Partner), and (ii) consistently reflect each such allocation in its books and records. 
 (b) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and
local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable
law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its
respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated
shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are
in accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. (c) For U.S. federal, state
and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are
allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 5.10; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations
have substantial economic 
 48 

effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority
to any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an adjustment to any Partner s distributive share thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined
by the General Partner) in accordance with the final resolution of such audit adjustment. ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms of such additional Partner s
participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution,
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time
unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special Partner ).
Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the
General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or
subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a GP-Related 
Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. (b) The
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other
Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be
allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by
the General Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any further act, vote or consent of any person, to make adjustments to the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to other Partners of the
Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. 
 49 

(c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his or her pro
rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times
and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. (d) The
admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of this Agreement by such additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional
Partner, as determined by the General Partner, (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such
writing being acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership and/or (iv) the listing of such additional Partner in the books and records of the Partnership by the General Partner. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign
a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the Trust Agreement that is acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. 
 Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner, including if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business. Without
limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less
than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided, that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership
with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from
the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. 
 (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any
Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. 
 50 

(c) Upon the Total Disability of a Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be
a Limited Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided, that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special Partner
with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether
any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall
nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such person s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If the
General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such
notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. (e) The Withdrawal
from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the
Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. 
 Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not Transferable . 
 (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided, that this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by operation of
law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further, that, subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust, limited
partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting
Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to the Partnership (including the
obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require any Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the
Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law
 
 51 

or otherwise) of the whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a Partner without the prior written
consent of the General Partner (which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue
to be a Partner of the Partnership. (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . 
 (a) Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its
right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute
General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided however, that the General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise)
and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of
liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner
and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as
contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or
more of such remaining Partners continue the business of the Partnership (any and all such remaining Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). Notwithstanding
Section 6.4(c), if upon the Withdrawal of a Partner there shall be no remaining Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be dissolved and shall be wound up unless, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Withdrawal, all remaining Special
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. 
 (c) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or
remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 52 

Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests . (a) The terms of this
Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner
Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner
Interest is retained as a Special Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date
for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall
be his or her Withdrawal Date; provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month
in which his or her Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained
a Partner of the Partnership during such period. (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). 
 53 

(e) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with
respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment)
and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph
(f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate
negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided, that if the Withdrawn Partner was
solely a Special Partner on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Special Partner, upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the General Partner as of
such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or
the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 (i) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described
below, to receive a Nonvoting Special Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than
all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Investor Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. The election referred to
above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership
pursuant to this Section 6.5. 
 54 

(f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s
 percentage interest means his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn
Partner shall retain his or her percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable
to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn Partner shall become and remain a Special Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so
designates, such Special Partner shall be a Nonvoting Special Partner). The GP-Related Partner Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole
discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that
the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to this sentence. (g)
The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to paragraph (e) above, to (i) have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to
(ii) distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be
reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General
Partner. (h) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of
such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind distributions to be made
to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in respect of the settlement
of his or her GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above or
adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by
the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of
payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or
distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of
the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. 
 55 

(j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date
in making the foregoing calculations should prove, in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess,
or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such deficiency, as the case may be. (k) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn
Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after the Settlement Date e.g. , outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the
Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under
this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at a floating rate equal to the lesser of (x) the Prime Rate or (y) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. The due date of
amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in respect of GP-Related Investments for which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph (f) above shall be 120 days after realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such amounts are determined to be payable. 
 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of a security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with
respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his or her GP-Related Partner Interest shall be settled in
accordance with paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5; provided , that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such
settlement: (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any
 GP-Related Investment in which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized
Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn
Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her
 GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income 
 56 

(Loss) from such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply the provisions
of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related 
Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the
Settlement Date (the balance of such GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned on the compliance by such
Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a period not exceeding two
years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph (n) may elect to forfeit the
principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such restrictions. 
 (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the General Partner) a
discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. (p) The
provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Special Partner relating to a Limited Partner or Special Partner and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner
pursuant to Section 6.3 if such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership. (q) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his
or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine
in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or
her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it
can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day- to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 57 

(r) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General
Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make,
execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter
contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5, including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is
coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner.

term at any time on not less than 60 days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in

shall determine all matters concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion. (a) The
General Partner shall cause to be prepared all federal, state and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns
to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the
several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any
and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he or she shall not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his or her interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information
statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his or her income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of
an income tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any
administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his or her

disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and (C) no Partner shall have the right to (1) participate in the audit of any Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership (unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings
conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any
such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by
the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as the partnership representative (as defined under the Code) (the Tax Matters
Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses
resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.7 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. (b) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each
federal, state and local income tax return of such Partner (including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. (c)
To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership holds an interest) is or may be required by law to withhold or to make tax payments, including interest and penalties on such
amounts, on behalf of or with respect to any Partner, or as a result of a Partner s participation in the Partnership or as a result of a Partner s failure to provide requested tax information, including pursuant to Section 6225 or
Section 1446(f) of the Code Tax Advances ), the General Partner may withhold or escrow such amounts or make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner shall, at the option of the General Partner,
(i) be promptly paid to the Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been
made to such Partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to
the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the Partnership) unreduced by the
amount of such Tax Advance. To the extent that any taxes are imposed on the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership invests that is treated as a flow-through entity for relevant tax purposes) with respect to income of the Partnership (or
such entity) in lieu of taxes imposed directly on a Partner with respect to such income (including any state or local income taxes), whether by election of the Partnership or the General Partner or otherwise, such amounts shall be deemed to have
been distributed to such Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and 
 59 

hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect
to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from the Partnership or any Transfer of a Partner s
interest. Section 6.8. Special Basis Adjustments . In connection with any assignment or transfer of a Partnership
interest permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the manner provided in Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.754-1(b), to make an election to adjust the basis of the Partnership s property in the manner provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code. 
 ARTICLE VII CAPITAL COMMITMENT
INTERESTS; CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS 
 Section 7.1. Capital Commitment Interests, etc. 
 (a) This Article VII and Article VIII hereof set forth certain terms and conditions with respect to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests
and the Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Interest and matters related to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VII or in Article VIII, the terms
and provisions of this Article VII and Article VIII shall not apply to the GP-Related Partner Interests or the GP-Related SP RE VIII Interest. 
 (b) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to SP RE VIII in respect of the Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Commitment, if any (including,
without limitation, funding all or a portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment). No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in an amount in excess of such Partner s Capital
Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each Capital
Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the
Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment, or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or
SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms
upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related
Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 60 

(c) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing
Party may in its sole discretion advance to any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any
portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions due to the Partnership from such Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Partner shall pay interest to the Advancing
Party on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the
Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party
absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such
rate upon such Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant
to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of
Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed
the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. 
 61 

Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be
allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 7.7
shall be specially allocated to the electing Partner. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as
it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments,
distributions to such Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including, without limitation, Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests)
during a Fiscal Year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such Fiscal Year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole discretion of the
General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected
by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): (i) First, to the
payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise) of such Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all
interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 62 

(ii) Second, to distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S.
federal, state and local income taxes on income of the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by
the General Partner, subject to the limitation that the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were
all allocated to an individual subject to the then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes (including, without limitation, taxes imposed under Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character
of such taxable income allocated by the Partnership and the limitations on deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes); provided, that additional amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this clause
(ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant
partnership or other entity; provided further, that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to
provisions in such other BE Agreements that are comparable to this clause (ii); (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the
principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year or (B) any BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such
Fiscal Year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Partner of (A) all
Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any
Blackstone Entity (other than the Partnership) in respect of interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related
Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); 
 (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal (including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of
such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; 
 (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v)
above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division
of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; and 
 63 

(vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital
Commitment Net Income remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to
clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed
to such Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the discretion of the General Partner.
At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period
in respect of which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). 
 64 

(f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a
Capital Commitment Investment is being considered by the Partnership or SP RE VIII (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect
to such Capital Commitment Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital
Commitment Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment
shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
Class A Interests. (g) If the Partnership is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP RE VIII a Giveback Amount
with respect to any Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the General Partner
shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the
General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Interest (the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata 
share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to
satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation and (c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP RE VIII Agreement is
unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Investment, all Capital Commitment SP RE VIII Investments. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution
Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital
Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). (i) In
the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner
shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata 
basis (based on each of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s
Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution 
 65 

if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment of the
Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital Commitment
Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner s in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner
shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good
faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not
ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the
Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment
from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name
of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (A) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (ii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the
Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5. Valuations .
Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any other Affiliate of the
Partnership that is a general partner of SP RE VIII) in valuing investments of SP RE VIII or, in the case of investments not held by SP RE VIII, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the
immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment
 
 66 

Investment as set forth above; provided, that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided
further, that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as
restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding
on all Partners; provided further, that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member or partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. 
 Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such
Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the
Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not
be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to
or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 67 

ARTICLE VIII 
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as
 Non-Contingent for purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment
Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount
of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided, that in the
event that a Partner prepays all or any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, the Partnership (or its
designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further, that the purchase price for such
Capital Commitment Interest shall be determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Partner shall
apply pro rata against all of such Partner s Investor Notes; provided, that such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Entities specified
by such Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests.
 (b) Upon a Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such
Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its
designee(s) within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership (subject to the prior consent of the General
Partner, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by
the Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 (i) The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be an amount equal to (A) the
outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to
(x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to be repurchased, plus (y) all Capital
 
 68 

Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the
Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest; provided, that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or
(y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from
the next Capital Commitment Net Income received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative,
it shall be payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn
Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or (B) if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided, that the Partnership and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a Withdrawn
Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment
Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. (ii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an officer
or employee, all Investor Notes shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of the
Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). (iii) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the
Partnership nor its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor
Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the
Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the Partnership shall apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. 
 (iv) To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the
purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. 
 69 

(c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall
thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a
Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or
Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time, in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in
Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until
distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal
or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. (d) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability) (and the purchase
price for such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal representative or other Successor in
Interest, in cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, so requests in
writing within 180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year),
the Partnership or its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as of the last day of the
Partnership s then current Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his or her will
to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, within 30 days of the
first date on which the General Partner knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in
Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment
Value thereof. 
 70 

(e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an employee or officer of the Partnership
or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its
sole discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Partner or another Affiliate of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined in good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase).
The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph (d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate
irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. (f) The Partnership may subsequently
transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital
Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the
designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are
repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner
already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment
Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent
that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or (ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital
Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners
receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and
the General Partner shall otherwise agree; provided, that such indebtedness shall become fully recourse to the extent and at the time provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be non-recourse or so limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such
Partners; 
 71 

provided, that a Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor Note(s), be obligated to accept any obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this
Section 8.1), unless his or her prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to
the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness.
Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital
Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. 
 (g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for
Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1; provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a
direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interest); (ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain such
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment
shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof;
or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory
note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. (h) The Partnership will assist a
Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to
retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or
guardian, as the case may be, prior to 
 72 

engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it
can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without
limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General
Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided, that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn Partner s or Deceased or Totally Disabled
Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another Partner of
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any
reason therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning Vehicle (it
being understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General Partner in
connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General Partner shall
designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Partner and such Nonvoting
Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle
to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such Partner s right to
participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or the pledging or
granting of a security interest in, its entire Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 73 

Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to
the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 ARTICLE IX DISSOLUTION 
 Section 9.1. Dissolution . The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (a) pursuant to Section 6.6; or 
 (b) upon the expiration of the term of the Partnership. 
 Section 9.2. Final Distribution . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, and following the payment of creditors of the
Partnership and the making of provisions for the payment of any contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the Partnership as required under the Partnership Act: 
 (a) The Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the GP-Related Capital Account
balances of the Partners; and (b) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to
such Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment
Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment;
and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. The General Partner shall be the liquidator. In the
event that the General Partner is unable to serve as liquidator, a liquidating trustee shall be chosen by the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Partners voting at a meeting of Partners (excluding Nonvoting Special Partners). 
 Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner Interests . 
 (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner
Interests which, in the judgment of the liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in
 
 74 

each such Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to
Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed
until such time as the liquidator shall determine. (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against
the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss
therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier
time as the liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover
the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on account of such transaction or claim. (c) Upon determination by the
liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time,
distribute as provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were
withheld. ARTICLE X 
 MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably,
including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including
the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as any and all disputes arising out of, relating to or in connection with the termination, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership), whether arising during the
existence of the Partnership or at or after its termination or during or after the liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York U.S.A., in accordance
with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the
International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration
proceedings. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may cause the Partnership to bring,
on behalf of the General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary
 
 75 

relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of
paragraph (c) of this Section 10.1 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies
at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who
shall promptly advise such Partner of any such service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Partner in any such action or proceeding. 
 (b) EACH PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such
ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the forum(s)
designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another. 
 (i) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such
invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act
or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Blackstone Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ), a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and
that the ownership of, and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors,
successors or assigns) has licensed the 
 76 

Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and
name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities
with the permission of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by
TM and its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such
termination, the Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service
mark or otherwise. Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a vote of Partners at
a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. 
 Section 10.4. Letter Agreements; Schedules . The General Partner may, or may cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously
entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners, officers or employees with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, benefits or any
other matter, which letter agreements have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing, the terms of this Agreement with respect to any such Partner and such matters. The parties hereto agree that any rights established, or
any terms of this Agreement altered or supplemented, in any such separate letter agreement, including any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, shall govern solely with respect to such Partner notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.
The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever; provided,
that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. Section 10.5. Governing
Law , Separability of Provisions . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware , without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been
formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall
be given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. 
 Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to
the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided, that no person
claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or 
 77 

otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the
right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless
waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based on the standards set forth in Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and Section 7.4(g)(ii)(A), to pursue such transferee, pursue
payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended,
nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the
extent required by the SP RE VIII Agreements, (x) the limited partners in SP RE VIII shall be third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely
as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in Section 9.4(a) of the SP RE VIII Partnership Agreement) and (y) the amendment of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A)
(and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in Section 9.4(a) of the SP RE VIII Partnership Agreement), in a manner materially adverse to such limited partners
shall be effective against such limited partners only with the 66 2 3 Combined Limited Partner Consent (as such term is used in the SP RE VIII Partnership
Agreement). Section 10.7. Confidentiality . 
 (a) By executing this Agreement, each Partner expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or
not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than the Partnership, another Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business,
financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally known to the public or the securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided , that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law, rule, regulation or custom to disclose. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee, representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding (a) the
Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any performance information relating to any of the Partners or their
investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax structure information. 
 78 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or impede any Partner from communicating,
cooperating or filing a complaint on possible violations of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation to or with any governmental agency or regulatory authority (collectively, a Governmental Entity ), including, but not
limited to, the SEC, FINRA, EEOC or NLRB, or from making other disclosures to any Governmental Entity that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation; provided, that in each case such
communications and disclosures are consistent with applicable law. Each Partner understands and acknowledges that (a) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any U.S. federal or state trade secret law for the
disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in confidence to a U.S. federal, state, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (ii) in a complaint
or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (b) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to
the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
Moreover, a Partner shall not be required to give prior notice to (or get prior authorization from) Blackstone regarding any such communication or disclosure. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or under applicable law, under no
circumstance is any Partner authorized to disclose any information covered by Blackstone or its affiliates attorney-client privilege or attorney work product or Blackstone s trade secrets without the prior written consent of Blackstone.
 Section 10.8. Notices . Whenever notice is required or permitted by this Agreement to be given, such notice shall be in
writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be given by hand delivery (including any courier service) or telecopy to any Partner at its address or telecopy number shown in the Partnership s books and records or, if given to the
General Partner, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch and (ii) if given by hand delivery, when delivered to the address of such
Partner, the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. Section 10.9. Counterparts . This Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute a single instrument. For the avoidance of doubt, a Person s execution and delivery of this Agreement by electronic
signature and electronic transmission (jointly, an Electronic Signature ), including via DocuSign or other similar method, shall constitute the execution and delivery of a counterpart of this Agreement by or on behalf of such Person and
shall bind such Person to the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement and any additional information incidental hereto may be maintained as electronic records. Any Person executing and delivering this Agreement by an
Electronic Signature further agrees to take any and all reasonable additional actions, if any, evidencing its intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, as may be reasonably requested by the General Partner. 
 79 

Section 10.10. Power of Attorney . Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints
the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make,
execute, sign and file all instruments, documents and certificates which, from time to time, may be required to set forth any amendment to this Agreement or may be required by this Agreement or by the laws of the United States of America, the State
of Delaware or any other state in which the Partnership shall determine to do business, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, to execute, implement and continue the valid and subsisting existence of the Partnership. Such power of attorney
is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the subsequent Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity of
such Partner. Section 10.11. Partner s Will . Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall include in his
or her will a provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligations relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner and each such Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the
Partnership, in writing, that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Interest is
transferred shall include a provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its substantial equivalent remains in such trust. In the event
any Partner or Withdrawn Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.11 after the Partnership has notified such Partner or Withdrawn Partner of his or her failure to so comply and such failure to so comply is not cured within
30 days of such notice, the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Partner until the time at which such party complies with the requirements of this Section 10.11. 
 Section 10.12. Cumulative Remedies . Rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and do not preclude use of other
rights and remedies available under applicable law. Section 10.13. Legal Fees . Except as more specifically provided
herein, in the event of a legal dispute (including litigation, arbitration or mediation) between any Partner or Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership, arising in connection with any party seeking to enforce Section 4.1(d) or any other provision
of this Agreement relating to the Holdback, the Clawback Amount, the GP-Related Giveback Amount, the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, the Net GP-Related 
Recontribution Amount or the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount, the losing party to such dispute shall promptly reimburse the victorious party for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
dispute (such determination to be made by the relevant adjudicator). Any amounts due under this Section 10.13 shall be paid within 30 days of the date upon which such amounts are due to be paid and such amounts remaining unpaid after such date
shall accrue interest at the Default Interest Rate. Section 10.14. Entire Agreement ; Modifications . This
Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those
expressly set forth or referred to herein. Subject to Section 10.4, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Except as provided herein, this Agreement may be
amended or modified at any time by the General Partner in its sole discretion, upon notification thereof to the Limited Partners. 
 80 

Section 10.15. Section Titles . The headings contained in this Agreement are
for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement. 
 81 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the day and

Section 3.6. Exculpation and Indemnification . 
 (a) Liability to Partners . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, whether express or implied, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, no Partner nor any of such Partner s representatives, agents or advisors nor any partner, member, officer, employee, representative, agent or advisor of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates (individually, a
 Covered Person and collectively, the Covered Persons shall be liable to the Partnership or any other Partner for any act or omission (in relation to the Partnership, this Agreement, any related document or any
transaction or investment contemplated hereby or thereby) taken or omitted by a Covered Person (other than any act or omission constituting Cause), unless there is a final and non-appealable judicial
determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority
granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such Covered Person s conduct was unlawful. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely in good faith
on the advice of legal counsel to the Partnership, accountants and other experts or professional advisors, and no action taken by any Covered Person in reliance on such advice shall in any event subject such person to any liability to any Partner or
the Partnership. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or to another Partner, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such Partner acting under
this Agreement shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any such other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they expand or restrict the duties and
liabilities of a Partner otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to modify to that extent such other duties and liabilities of such Partner. 
 (b) Indemnification . (i) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless (but only to
the extent of the Partnership s assets (including, without limitation, the remaining capital commitments of the Partners) each Covered Person from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses and liabilities (including,
without limitation, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim), joint and
several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, for purposes of this Section 3.6, Losses ), arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person s management of the affairs of the Partnership or which relate to or
arise out of or in connection with the Partnership, its property, its business or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of any act or omission of such
Covered Person constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section with respect to any claim, issue or matter if there is a final and
 non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interest of the Partnership and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such Covered Person s conduct was
unlawful; provided further , that if such Covered Person is a Partner or a Withdrawn Partner, such Covered Person shall bear its share of such Losses in accordance with such Covered Person s
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in the Partnership 
 25 

as of the time of the actions or omissions that gave rise to such Losses. To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person (including, without
limitation, the General Partner) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval of the General Partner, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand,
action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized in this Section, and the Partnership and its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such Covered Person s interests/investments in the Partnership and such Affiliates and shall have the right to
withhold amounts otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such Partner shall be
responsible, up to the amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining capital commitment, for such Partner s pro rata share of the Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the General
Partner. The Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect
to indemnification pursuant to this Section. The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify pursuant to this Section 3.6. 
 (ii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty, it is understood and/or agreed that the
Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable law governing SP NC and/or a particular
portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the following order of priority: first out of
proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP NC, second by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment is indirectly held, and third by SP NC (only to the
extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). (B) The Partnership s obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance
expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP NC and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies
maintained thereby), and to the extent the Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP NC and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance
policies maintained thereby), it is agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP NC and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be
specifically empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may
determine necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing. 
 26 

Section 3.7. Representations of Limited Partners . 
 (a) Each Limited Partner by execution of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the terms and conditions hereof as provided herein
or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Limited Partner is acquiring each of such Limited Partner s Interests for such Limited
Partner s own account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Limited Partner hereunder; provided ,
that a Partner may choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Limited Partner represents and warrants that such Limited Partner understands that the Interests have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore such Interests may not be resold without registration under such Act or exemption from such registration, and that accordingly such Limited Partner must bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner represents that such Limited Partner has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that such Limited Partner is capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, and that such Limited Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner represents that such Limited Partner s overall commitment to the Partnership and
other investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Limited Partner s net worth and the Limited Partner has no need for liquidity in the Limited Partner s investment in Interests. Each Limited Partner
represents that to the full satisfaction of the Limited Partner, the Limited Partner has been furnished any materials that such Limited Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and has been
afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information relating
thereto. Each Limited Partner represents that the Limited Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Limited Partner with the Limited Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an
investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Limited Partner. 
 (b) Each Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be true and correct as of any date
that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that such capital contribution shall
serve as confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof. 
 Section 3.8. Tax Representation . Each Limited Partner certifies that (A) if the Limited Partner is a United States person (as
defined in the Code) (x) (i) the Limited Partner s name, social security number (or, if applicable, employer identification number) and address provided to the Partnership and its Affiliates pursuant to an IRS Form W-9, Payer s Request for Taxpayer Identification Number Certification W-9 or otherwise are correct and (ii) the Limited Partner will complete
and return a W-9, and (y) (i) the Limited Partner is a United States person (as defined in the Code) and (ii) the Limited Partner will notify the Partnership within 60 days of a change to foreign (non-United States) status or (B) if the Limited Partner is not a United States

including but not limited to a W-8BEN or W-8IMY, and (y) (i) the Limited Partner is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) and (ii) the Limited
Partner will notify the Partnership within 60 days of any change of such status. The Limited Partner agrees to properly execute and provide to the Partnership in a timely manner any tax documentation that may be reasonably required by the
Partnership or the General Partner. ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . (a) Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the
Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required
to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP NC in respect of the GP-Related SP NC Interest with respect to any GP-Related SP NC
Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any; provided , that additional
 GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each Partner s Carried
Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business operations (as
distinct from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Sections 4.1(d) and 5.8(d)) shall be determined by the General Partner. Limited Partners shall not be required to make
additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an increase in such
Limited Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided , that the General Partner and any Limited Partner may agree from time to
time that such Limited Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided further , that each Investor Limited Partner shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total capital
of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP NC Interest. (b) The General Partner may elect on
a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. any
Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant
to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in
installments, in each case on terms determined by the General Partner. 
 28 

(c) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a
Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (d) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which certain amounts of distributions relating
to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a Holdback ). 
 (i) The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall
be withheld for any General Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner) and each Partner Category (such withheld percentage constituting a General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback
Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than any General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than any General Partner) and 5 for
Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for any General Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner) shall not
be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). (ii) The Holdback Percentage
may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a
proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in the
Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. 
 (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his Partner
Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners 
Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to
24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to
distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback
Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have
the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 29 

(iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Partnership may increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners and the General Partner (a
 Holdback Vote provided , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent;
 provided further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or
(II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an
amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for such Subject Partner s Partner Category; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject
Partner s successors or assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive
distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. 
 (B) A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners and the General Partner shall be
entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 
 (C) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject
Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually
satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided 
 further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject
Partner that submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected
 out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay
the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account to be controlled by Simpson Thacher Bartlett LLP, as escrow agent (or such other comparable law firm
as the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall agree). The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the
 
 30 

victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the
expenses of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party shall be the Partnership,
if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the
Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (D) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) (A) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the
 Excess Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his Holdback obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he was a Partner), to the extent his Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust Amounts (but
not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or otherwise making available
to the Partnership, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing
Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of
the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that in the case of entities listed in the books and records of the Partnership, in which Partners/members are permitted to pledge their interests therein to finance
all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or
Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the Partnership a second priority security interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone
Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the
corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) 
 31 

above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the books and records of the Partnership to remit any and all net proceeds
resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. 
 (B) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral
Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm
Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization,
if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his Excess Holdback requirement. If any such Partner
or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this clause
(C); provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in
such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (vi) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income
thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership
to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C 
 32 

Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P and P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1 by Moody s (if
the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30
days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier than the latest
possible termination date of SP NC, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30
days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an
L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank
whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance
with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his L/C upon (1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the
Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the
Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a
portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm
Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce
the amount of an L/C by any amount. (vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions by
the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind 
distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. 
 (B) In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge with respect to any
 in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the books and records of the Partnership; provided , that the initial contribution of such Special Firm
Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback Amount for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm
Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback Amount specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount
from the Trust Account. 
 33 

(viii) (A) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or
any portion of his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein,
obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any
Excess Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith
judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) )to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (B) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess
Holdback) is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust
Account)), then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or
other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes
hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a
Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
deficiency with respect to his Holdback in cash or an L/C. (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm
Collateral and/or any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the books and records of the Partnership), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral valued at
less than such Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the books and records of the Partnership, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the
 
 34 

Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 business days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute
cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply
thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to such default; provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the
term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C). (D) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the
General Partner may revoke the ability of such Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause
(C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion
of the Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback). (E) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner from using any amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, or
(iii) as determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V

the Partnership for Federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from Federal income taxation and not otherwise taken into account in computing
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value on the books of the Partnership that differs from its adjusted tax basis for Federal income tax
purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset on the books of the Partnership pursuant to
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any expenditures of the Partnership not deductible in

awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and
(vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership and Affiliates of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partnership and such Affiliates, among various Partnership
activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner. Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss)
by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid, unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened
litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items, shall be made in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP provided , that the General Partner shall

period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (g) In establishing
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate. (h) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under

more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP NC Interest
and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ).

establish the profit sharing percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss)
for such annual accounting period pursuant to Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , however , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during
such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (d) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such
accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such
 GP-Related Investment established in accordance with paragraph (d) below. The General Partner may establish different GP- Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any
Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages shall be allocated by the General Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner
pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion.

 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP- Related
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 38 

Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net
Income (Loss) . (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the
Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related 
Investment of all the Partners participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first , in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of
 Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners, second , to
Partners that received Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the
years such GP- Related Net Income is being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of
 GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third , to the Partners
in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been
distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. (b) GP-Related Net Loss of
the Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP- Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP NC and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof
(based on capital contributions made by the Partnership to SP NC with respect to the GP-Related SP NC Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP NC and
 (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP NC and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s
(including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above, GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest
allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as
the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in
accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. 
 (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period
unrelated to SP NC, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such
accounting period. (e) The General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner
admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net
Income (Loss). Section 5.5. Liability of General Partners . General Partners shall have unlimited liability for the
satisfaction and discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. 
 39 

Section 5.6. Liability of Limited Partners . Each Limited Partner and former
Limited Partner shall be liable for the satisfaction and discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership allocable to him pursuant to Section 5.4 or 7.3, but only to the extent required by applicable law. Except as
otherwise provided in the following sentence, in no event shall any Limited Partner or former Limited Partner be obligated to make any additional capital contribution to the Partnership in excess of his aggregate
 GP-Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 7.1, or have any liability in excess of such aggregate
 GP- Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions for the satisfaction and discharge of the losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. In no way does any of the
foregoing limit any Partner s obligations under Section 4.1(d), 5.8(d) or 7.4(g) or otherwise to make capital contributions as provided hereunder. 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc . The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP NC Investments as the General Partner may determine. The General
Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that is
Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time, and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. Section 5.8.
 Distributions . (a) (i) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments
as provided herein) or other property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General
Partner shall, if it deems it appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established
pursuant to Section 5.1(a). Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective
 Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Sections 4.1(d) and 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with
their respective Carried Interest Sharing Percentages. (ii) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other
disposition by SP NC of a portion of a GP- Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the
election of the General Partner each Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP- Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP- Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP NC) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP- 
 40 

Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP NC) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest)
shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to
each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP- Related Net Income (Loss) of each
such category. (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner,
the Partnership shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total Federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be
payable by such Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that
each Partner is an individual subject to the then prevailing maximum Federal, New York State and New York City income and other tax rates, (ii) taking into account the deductibility of State and local income and other taxes for Federal income
tax purposes and (iii) taking into account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of
the foregoing sentence, the General Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by the Partnership Act. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof
(together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the
applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase
Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP- Related Investment that remains
Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be
allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment,
or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of
unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new
Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Limited Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to
its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. 
 41 

(d) (i)(A) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback
Provisions to contribute to SP NC a Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP NC Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the
Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the Partnership shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations
of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the Partnership, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership
(and the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount
payable by the Partnership, in the case of Clawback Amounts, and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest
and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP NC Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback
Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP NC Investments
other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP NC Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP NC Investment, all GP-Related SP NC Investments. Each Partner and
Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call, such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if
applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs 
obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount and/or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably
practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the Partnership shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the Partnership may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the Partnership s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the
Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account used to pay any part of any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. Solely to the extent required by the SP NC Agreements, each member of the
 
 42 

General Partner shall have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and
under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) solely with respect to such member s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in section 11.3(b) of the SP NC Partnership Agreements) and solely to the extent the
Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under section 11.3 of the SP NC Partnership Agreements and/or the corresponding provisions under any other SP NC Agreement. 
 (B) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the Partnership s call for GP- Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment
hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP- Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the
Partnership shall require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such
amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the
Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of
the amount of the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 43 

(B) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith
judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not
ultimately reimbursed by the GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party
becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP- Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the Partnership a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the
Partnership may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the Partnership as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The Partnership shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (C) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related 
Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust
Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution before seeking cash
contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution. 
 (iii) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating writedowns and losses (to be determined by
the General Partner in accordance with GAAP and as reported by SP NC) on GP-Related SP NC Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to
those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other
 GP-Related SP NC Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 44 

(i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in
connection with a GP-Related SP NC Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP NC Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall
calculate amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share of
each such Loss Investment based on his Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution to all
Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP NC) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 (B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject
Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP NC) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and 
 (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest
Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution, and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to satisfy such
negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Tax Rate in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions
(the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set
forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest
distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined (as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a
Withdrawn Partner. 
 45 

To the extent there is an amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution with respect
to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be allocated to the other Partners pro
rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. 
 A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the
extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). Any Net Carried Interest Distribution
Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner, including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the
Subject Investment; provided , that any such amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such
distribution (taken together with the other Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the
case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses in any GP-Related SP NC
Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP NC Investment with respect to which Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such
Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP NC Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 46 

Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the
General Partner shall be based on its good faith judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies
to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners. It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the
Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP NC Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For Federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. (b) For Federal, State and local
income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each fiscal year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are allocated
among the Partners pursuant to clause (a) above, provided the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations have substantial economic effect or are in
accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as General Partners or Limited Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Sections 3.7 and 3.8. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with 
 47 

the additional Partner all terms of such additional Partner s participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial
 GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage.
Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Limited Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Limited Partner
shall not have such voting rights (any such Limited Partner being called a Nonvoting Limited Partner ). Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and
conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to
finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited
Partner to such extent. Any Additional Partner may have a GP-Related Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. 
 (b) The GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of
the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the
General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction
in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner. 
 (c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his pro rata share of the Partnership s total
capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times and in such amounts as shall be determined
by the General Partner in accordance with Sections 4.1 and 7.1. (d) The admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by
(i) the execution of a counterpart copy of, or counter-signature page with respect to, this Agreement by such additional Partner, or (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional Partner, as
determined by the General Partner, or (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a substitute or additional Limited Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement
and such writing being accepted by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a
party to the Trust Agreement. Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner. The General Partner
generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less than 15 days prior written
 
 48 

notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided , that a Partner may
not voluntarily Withdraw without the consent of the General Partner if such Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner,
have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business; provided further that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner
Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest
without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. 
 (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any
Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. (c) Upon the Total Disability of a
Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided , however , that the General Partner may elect
to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP- Related
Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the
absence of agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If
the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest,
such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. (e) The
Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all
obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. 
 49 

Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests
Not Transferable . (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest without the prior written consent of the General Partner; provided , that, subject to the Partnership Act, this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by operation of
law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further , that, subject to the prior written consent of the
General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust,
limited partnership or limited liability company with respect to which such Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle
will be a Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the interest
transferred (including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw
from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(a), no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or otherwise) of
the whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a General Partner or Limited Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which
consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire partnership interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a partner of the
Partnership. (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all Federal, State and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. General Partner Withdrawal; Transfer of General Partner s Interest . 
 (a) The General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its right to manage the affairs of
the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, with the prior written approval of a Majority In Interest of the Partners admit another person as an additional or substitute General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself
as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided , however , that the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the
Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise) and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part
of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under
this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership
and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security
interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. 
 50 

(b) Except as contemplated by clause (a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not
permitted. The Withdrawal of a General Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining General Partners and any one or more of such remaining General Partners continue the business of the
Partnership (any and all such remaining General Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). If upon the Withdrawal of a General Partner there shall be no remaining
General Partner, the Partnership nonetheless shall not be dissolved and shall not be required to be wound up if, within 90 days after the occurrence of such event of Withdrawal, all remaining Limited Partners (excluding Withdrawn Partners) agree in
writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more General Partners. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest . (a) The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related 
Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term
 Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Limited Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for
all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his Withdrawal Date; provided , that if
a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month in which his Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval,
if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on
capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained a Partner of the Partnership during such period. 
 (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner with respect to such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall, promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. 
 51 

(d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner, the Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related 
Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided in paragraph (f) below). 
 (e) (i) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss) or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment)
and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph
(f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(p) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate
negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided , that if the Withdrawn Partner
was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Limited Partner) on his Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative
balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Limited Partner), upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance
with their respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the
General Partner as of such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill,
the Partnership name or the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 52 

(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the
case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative,
as the case may be, may elect, at the time described below, to receive a Nonvoting Limited Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest. The election referred to above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5. (f) For
purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest means his GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn Partner shall retain his percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his
 GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn
Partner shall become and remain a Limited Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so designates, such Limited Partner shall be a Nonvoting Limited Partner). The GP-Related Partner
Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms
and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to
this sentence. (g) The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to
paragraph (e) above, to have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by the General
Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn
Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. (h) [Intentionally
omitted]. (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the
settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind
distributions to be made to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in
respect of the settlement of his GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership (e.g., payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above
or adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the 
 53 

valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by
the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or
any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or distribution; provided that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become
Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the
Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the
Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should prove, in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his estate such
excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his estate such deficiency, as the case may be. (k) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn
Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after the Settlement Date (e.g., outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn
Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under this
Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at a floating rate equal to the lesser of (x) the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as its prime rate or
(y) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. The due date of amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The
 due date of amounts payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in respect of GP-Related Investments for which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph
(f) above shall be 120 days after realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such
amounts are determined to be payable. (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the
assignment, pledge, encumbrance or other transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in
kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required
to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his GP-Related Partner
Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5; provided , however , that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such
settlement:

(i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any GP-Related Investment in which he has an interest as of his Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss)
attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn Partner his allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause
(x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such
 GP-Related Investment as of his Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply the provisions of paragraph (f) above, provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any
 GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned on the compliance by such
Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a period not exceeding two
years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph (o) may elect to forfeit the
principal amount payable in the final installment of his subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such restrictions. 
 (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the General Partner) a
discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Limited Partner relating to another Limited Partner,
and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner pursuant to Section 6.3, if such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership. 
 (p) (i) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his estate. 
 55 

(ii) The Partnership may reasonably determine in good faith to retain
outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the Partnership will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the
case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the Partnership will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the
Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (q) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful
agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner,
any and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5,
including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 6.6. Termination of the Partnership . The General Partner may dissolve the Partnership at any time on not less than 60
days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Sections, 6.5, which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the capital account balances of the Partners. 
 Section 6.7. Certain Tax Matters . All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated
among the Partners for Federal, State and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided
herein or by the Code or other applicable law. To the extent U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Subchapter K of the Code (including under Sections 704(b) and (c) of the Code) or other applicable law require allocations for tax
purposes that differ from the foregoing allocations, the General Partner may determine the manner in which such tax allocations shall be made so as to comply more fully with such Treasury Regulations or other applicable law and, at the same time,
preserve the economic relationships among the Partners as set forth in this Agreement. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and
gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to
contain a qualified income offset as provided in Regulations Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
 56 

(a) The General Partner shall cause to be prepared all Federal, State and local tax returns
of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment
of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item
or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he shall not,
unless he provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his individual income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with
the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his income tax returns or
(ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of an income tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for
refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim
for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his decision shall be final and binding upon, the Partnership and all Partners except to the extent a Partner shall properly
elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in connection therewith (including, without limitation, attorneys , accountants and other experts fees and
disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and (C) no Partner shall have the right to (1) participate in the audit of any Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership (unless he provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by
the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit
conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the
Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as the tax matters partner for purposes of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code (the Tax
Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and
expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.8 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. (b) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each
Federal, State and local income tax return of such Partner (including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. 
 57 

Section 6.8. Special Basis Adjustments . In connection with any assignment or
transfer of a Partnership interest permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the manner provided in Code Regulations
 Section 1.754-1(b), to make an election to adjust the basis of the Partnership s property in the manner provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.

each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner
the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms upon which the General Partner and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The
acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such
appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time.

date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm
Advance, binding on the Limited Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such
Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Limited Partner of such rate upon such Limited Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law;
 provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Limited Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion,
change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Limited Partners of any material changes to such

date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital

other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner.

Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be

Interests) during a fiscal year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such fiscal year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole
discretion of the General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Limited Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership (or in each case on
such earlier date as selected by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): 
 (i) First , to the payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or
otherwise) of such Limited Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all interest payments due, the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes
upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second , to distribution to the Limited Partner of an amount equal to the Federal, State and local income taxes on
income of the Partnership allocated to such Limited Partner for such year in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner,
subject to the limitation that the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an
individual subject to the then-prevailing maximum Federal, New York State and New York City tax rates (taking into account the extent to which such taxable income allocated by the Partnership was composed of long-term capital gains and the
deductibility of State and local income taxes for Federal income tax purposes)); provided , that additional amounts shall be paid to the Limited Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount
 
 60 

reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Limited Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BCE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such
provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further , that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BCE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise
distributable to the Limited Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BCE Agreements that are comparable to this clause (ii); 
 (iii) Third , to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital
Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year or (B) any BCE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; 
 (iv) Fourth , to the return to such Limited Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made
in respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Collateral Entity (other than the
Partnership) in respect of interests therein relating to BCE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not
repaid from amounts of Other Sources (other than amounts of CC Carried Interest); (v) Fifth , to the payment of
principal (including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Limited Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid
and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth , up

those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied
thereto to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; and (vii) Seventh , to such Limited Partner to the extent of
any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other BCE Investment, as applicable, the payments in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BCE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Limited Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone, 
 61 

distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the General Partner or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof,
any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Limited Partner, until all such Limited
Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed to such Limited Partner. 
 Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the discretion of the General Partner. At the General
Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Limited Partner in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal payable on his Investor Notes for the full period in
respect of which the distribution is made. A distribution of Capital Commitment Net Income to the General Partner shall be made contemporaneously with each distribution of Capital Commitment Net Income to or for the accounts of the Limited Partners.
 (b) [Intentionally omitted] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Limited Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 7.4. (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a
Capital Commitment Investment is being considered by the Partnership or SP NC (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to
such Capital Commitment Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment
shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
Class A Interests. 
 62 

(g) (i) If the Partnership) is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to
SP NC all or a portion of a Giveback Amount with respect to the Capital Commitment SP NC Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the Partnership
shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the
Partnership, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP NC Interest (the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of
prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP NC Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, or (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such
Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP NC Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the Partnership may, in the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the
Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or
any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the Partnership shall require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each
of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment
Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a
result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner in respect of such default.
Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors
considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership
expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming
 
 63 

a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the Partnership a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a
Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the Partnership may sell,
collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner hereby appoints the Partnership as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact 
with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The Partnership shall be entitled to
collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default
Interest Rate. (B) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such
Partner to be a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (iii) A Partner s obligation to make
contributions to the Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5.
 Valuations . Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any
Affiliate of the Partnership that is a general partner of SP NC) in valuing investments of SP NC or, in the case of investments not held by SP NC, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the
immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above;
 provided , that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further , that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take
into account factors relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment
Interest and lack of control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further , that the immediately preceding
proviso shall not apply to any Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member of a General Partner. 
 64 

Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such
Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the
Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not be
adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to

 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. (b) Upon a Limited Partner ceasing to be an officer
or employee of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such Limited Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Limited Partner (the Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership or any other
person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s) within 45 days of such Limited Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or
employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership, subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in
the case of exercise of such right by the Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest will
be an amount equal to (i) the outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be made in cash) and (ii) an additional amount (the
 Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Limited Partner on the portion of the principal amount of the Investor Note relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent plus
(y) all Capital Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion
of such Capital Commitment Interest; provided , that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his position as an officer for Cause, the amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General
Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income
received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount resulting from an exchange is negative, it shall be
payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests or, if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided , that the General Partner and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing
to a Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn
 
 66 

Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, his related Investor Note shall be payable in full. If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercise the
right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully
recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his option, and the General Partner shall
apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment
Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. 
 (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Limited Partner, such Limited Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with
respect to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Limited Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right,
as against the Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Limited Partner s Capital
Commitment Partner Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII, subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)) to the
extent, at the time, in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Limited Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such
Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor
any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and
allocations hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. (d) If a Limited Partner dies or suffers a
Total Disability, all Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s
death or Total Disability) as provided in Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to the estate or personal representative in cash), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests
shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Limited Partner, if the estate or personal representative of such Limited Partner so requests in writing within 180 days of
the Limited Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership or
its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non- Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Limited Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then
current fiscal year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. Each Limited Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his will to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the
sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate or 
 67 

personal representative of such Limited Partner within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s death or Total Disability,
determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate or personal representative in exchange for such Non- Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in
Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non- Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier
period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. 
 (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Limited Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his ceasing to be an employee or officer of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter,
upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the
Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may
be itself another Limited Partner or another Affiliate of the General Partner) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price
equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph (d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and
delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the Partnership or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 (f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as
described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the Partnership s designee(s), Blackstone may loan all or a
portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc.
or any of its Affiliates). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such
repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest
relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment
Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or
(ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Limited Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness 
 68 

is repaid. The Limited Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement,
except as such Limited Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not so limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Limited Partners of such indebtedness on the
terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Limited Partners; provided , that a Limited Partner shall not, except as set forth in his Investor Note, be obligated to accept any personally
recourse obligation unless his prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the
Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any
Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion his aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of
all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. 
 (g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for
Cause, then his Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1; provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct member of a General Partner, the General
Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof; (ii) allow the Withdrawn
Partner to retain such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital
Commitment Investment shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital
Commitment Value thereof; or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. 
 (h) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his estate. 
 69 

(i) The Partnership may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals
to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the Partnership will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to
engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the Partnership will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably appoints each General Partner as such Limited Partner s true and lawful agent, representative
and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Limited Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Limited Partner, any
and all agreements, instruments, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without limitation,
the performance of any obligation of such Limited Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Limited Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Limited Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Limited Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Without the prior written consent of
the General Partner, no Limited Partner or former Limited Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided , that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn Partner s or deceased or Totally
Disabled Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Limited Partner to another Limited Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason
therefor, and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers, for estate planning purposes, of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an
Estate Planning Vehicle. Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such
Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate
Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Limited Partner of the Partnership, or acquire
such Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Limited Partner shall not cease to be a limited partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of, or the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire limited partner interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 70 

Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, no Transfer of a Capital Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all Federal, State and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws. 
 ARTICLE IX DISSOLUTION 
 Section 9.1. Dissolution . 
 (a) The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (i) pursuant to Section 6.6; 
 (ii) upon the expiration of the Term; or 
 (iii) upon the occurrence of a Disabling Event with respect to the last remaining General Partner, provided that the
Partnership shall not be dissolved if, within 90 days after the Disabling Event, Limited Partners entitled to vote thereon as provided herein who, as of the last day of the most recent accounting period ending on or prior to the date of the
Disabling Event, have aggregate GP-Related Capital Account balances representing at least a majority in amount of the total GP-Related Capital Account balances of all
the persons who are Limited Partners entitled to vote thereon as provided herein agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of the Disabling Event, of another General Partner. 
 (b) When the Partnership is dissolved, the business and property of the Partnership shall be wound up and liquidated by the General Partner
or, in the event of the unavailability of the General Partner, such Limited Partner or other liquidating trustee as shall be named by the Designated Limited Partner (the General Partner, such Limited Partner or other liquidating trustee, as the case
may be, being hereinafter referred to as the Liquidator ). Section 9.2. Final Distribution . (a) Within
120 calendar days after the effective date of dissolution of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership shall be distributed in the following manner and order: 
 (i) to the payment of the expenses of the winding-up, liquidation and dissolution of
the Partnership; (ii) to pay all creditors of the Partnership, other than Partners, either by the payment thereof or the
making of reasonable provision therefor; (iii) to establish reserves, in amounts established by the General Partner or the
Liquidator, to meet other liabilities of the Partnership; and 
 71 

(iv) to pay, in accordance with the terms agreed among them and otherwise on
a pro rata basis, all creditors of the Partnership that are Partners, either by the payment thereof or the making of reasonable provision therefor. 
 (b) The remaining assets of the Partnership shall be applied and distributed among the Partners as follows: 
 (i) With respect to each Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the remaining
assets of the Partnership shall be applied and distributed to such Partner in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the capital accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the
capital account balances of the Partners; and for purposes of the application of this Section 9.2 (b)(i), determining GP-Related Capital Accounts on liquidation, all unrealized gains, losses and accrued
income and deductions of the Partnership shall be treated as realized and recognized immediately before the date of distribution; and 
 (ii) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to such Partner in cash
or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment Investment shall not be
equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment; and the remaining assets
of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for each Capital Commitment
Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner
Interests . (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests which, in the judgment of the Liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly
distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in each such Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed
to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his pro rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or
other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the Liquidator shall determine. 
 (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the Liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to
such Partner pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the Liquidator shall determine.
The Partnership may meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the Liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable
loss or liability on account of such transaction or claim. 
 72 

(c) Upon determination by the Liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion
of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the Liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b)
such sums or such Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . (a) Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably,
including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including

Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator
shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration proceedings. 
 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may cause the Partnership to bring, on behalf of the
General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an
arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this Section 10.1 to any such action or proceeding,
(ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably appoints the General
Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who shall promptly advise such Partner of any such service of process, shall be

or other applicable law, such invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements

 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Firm Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ),
a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and that the ownership of,
and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors, successors or assigns) has
licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a
 non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the
permission of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and
its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such termination,
the Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service mark or
otherwise. Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a vote of Partners at a meeting may

cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages or any other matter. The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners Schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages
and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such Schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any
purpose whatsoever; provided that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement. Section 10.5.
 Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflict of laws. In particular, the Partnership has been formed pursuant to the Partnership
Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum
extent permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns;
Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any
successor to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner
itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Articles VI
and VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts)
of any transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based
on the standards set forth in Sections 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and 7.4(g)(ii) (A), to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or any Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and
their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the SP NC Agreements, the limited partners in SP NC shall be third-party beneficiaries of the provisions
of Sections 5.8(d)(i)(A) and 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in section 11.3 (b) of the SP NC Partnership Agreements). 
 Section 10.7. Partner s Will . Each Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall include in his or her will a
provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligation relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner, and each such Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in
writing, that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Limited Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Interest
 
 75 

is transferred shall include a provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its
substantial equivalent remains in such trust. In the event any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.7 after the Partnership has notified such Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner of his or
her failure to so comply and such failure to so comply is not cured within 30 days of such notice, the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner until the time at which such party complies with
the requirements of this Section 10.7. Section 10.8. Confidentiality . By executing this Agreement, each Partner
expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than the Partnership, another
Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business, financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally known to the public or the
securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided , however , that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law,
rule, regulation or custom to disclose. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee,
representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the
name of, or any other identifying information regarding (a) the Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any
performance information relating to any of the Partners or their investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax
structure information. Section 10.9. Notices . Whenever notice is required or permitted by this Agreement to be given, such
notice shall be in writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be given by hand delivery (including any courier service) or telecopy to any Partner at its address or telecopy number shown in the books and records of the Partnership or,
if given to the General Partner or the Partnership, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch, and (ii) if given by hand delivery,
when delivered to the address of such Partner or the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. Section 10.10.
 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute a single instrument.

 (b) All outside business or investment activities of the Partners (including outside directorships or trusteeships), shall be subject to such
rules and regulations as are established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 23

 Section 3.5. Exculpation and Indemnification . 
 (a) Liability to Partners . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, whether express or implied, to the fullest extent

 Covered Person and collectively, the Covered Persons shall be liable to the Partnership or any other Partner for any act or omission (in relation to the Partnership, this Agreement, any related document or any
transaction or investment contemplated hereby or thereby) taken or omitted by a Covered Person (other than any act or omission constituting Cause), unless there is a final and non-appealable judicial
determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority
granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of legal counsel to the Partnership, accountants and other experts or professional advisors, and no action taken by any
Covered Person in reliance on such advice shall in any event subject such person to any liability to any Partner or the Partnership. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating
thereto to the Partnership or to another Partner, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such Partner acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any such other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of
this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they expand or restrict the duties and liabilities of a Partner otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
modify to that extent such other duties and liabilities of such Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties hereto agree that the General Partner shall be held to have acted in good faith for the purposes of this Agreement and its
duties under the Partnership Act if it believes that it has acted honestly and in accordance with the specific terms of this Agreement. 
 (b) Indemnification . (i) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless (but only to
the extent of the Partnership s assets (including, without limitation, the remaining capital commitments of the Partners)) each Covered Person from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses and liabilities (including,
without limitation, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim), joint and
several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, for purposes of this Section 3.5(b), Losses ), arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person s management of the affairs of the Partnership or which relate to or
arise out of or in connection with the Partnership, its property, its business or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of any act or omission of such
Covered Person constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5(b) with respect to any claim, issue 
 24 

or matter if there is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good
faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement; provided further , that if such
Covered Person is a Partner or a Withdrawn Partner, such Covered Person shall bear its share of such Losses in accordance with such Covered Person s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in the Partnership
as of the time of the actions or omissions that gave rise to such Losses. To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person (including, without limitation, the General Partner) in defending any
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval of the General Partner, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the
Partnership of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this
Section 3.5(b), and the Partnership and its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such Covered Person s interests/investments in the Partnership and such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts
otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such Partner shall be responsible, up to the
amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining capital commitments, for such Partner s pro rata share of the Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the General Partner. The Partnership
may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). 
 (ii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty, it is understood and/or agreed that the
Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable law governing SP Infrastructure III
and/or a particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the following order of
priority: first , out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP Infrastructure III; second , by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment
is indirectly held; and third , by SP Infrastructure III (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). 
 (B) The Partnership s obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any
amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP Infrastructure III and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the
Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that 
 25 

should have been paid by SP Infrastructure III and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it is agreed among the
Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP Infrastructure III and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to structure
any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or advisable to give
effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing. Section 3.6. Representations of Partners . 
 (a) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner by execution of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the terms and conditions hereof
as provided herein or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Partner is acquiring each of such Partner s Interests for such
Partner s own account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Partner hereunder; provided , that a
Partner may choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (pursuant to Section 6.3(a) and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents and warrants that such Partner
understands that the Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act, and therefore such Interests may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act or exemption from such registration, and that accordingly such Partner
must bear the economic risk of an investment in the Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that such Partner has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that such
Partner is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, and that such Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that such Partner s
overall commitment to the Partnership and other investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Partner s net worth and the Partner has no need for liquidity in the Partner s investment in Interests. Each
Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of the Partner, the Partner has been furnished any materials that such Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and
has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information
relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning
an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner. 
 (b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be
true and correct as of any date that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that
such capital contribution shall serve as confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

of any change of such status. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner agrees to provide such cooperation and assistance, including but not limited to properly executing and providing to the Partnership in a timely manner any tax or other
documentation or information that may be reasonably requested by the Partnership or the General Partner. (c) Each Limited Partner and
Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership and the General Partner may release confidential information or other information about the Limited Partner or Special Partner or related to such Limited Partner or Special Partner s
investment in the Partnership if the Partnership or the General Partner, in its or their sole discretion, determines that such disclosure is required by applicable law or regulation or in order to comply for an exception from, or reduced tax rate
of, tax or other tax benefit. Any such disclosure shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed on any such person by law or otherwise, and a Limited Partner or Special Partner shall have no claim
against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of their Affiliates for any form of damages or liability as a result of actions taken by the foregoing in order to comply with any disclosure obligations that the foregoing reasonably believe are
required by law, regulation or otherwise. 
 27 

(d) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that if it provides
information that is in anyway materially misleading, or if it fails to provide the Partnership or its agents with any information requested hereunder, in either case in order to satisfy the Partnership s obligations, the General Partner
reserves the right to take any action and pursue any remedies at its disposal, including (i) requiring such Limited Partner or Special Partner to Withdraw for Cause and (ii) withholding or deducting any costs caused by such Limited
Partner s or Special Partner s action or inaction from amounts otherwise distributable to such Limited Partner or Special Partner from the Partnership and its Affiliates. 
 ARTICLE IV CAPITAL OF THE
PARTNERSHIP Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . (a) Each Partner shall be required to make capital
contributions to the Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required
Amounts as are required to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP Infrastructure III in respect of the GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Interest with respect
to any GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD
Agreement, if any, or otherwise; provided, that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the
Partners based upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to
be used for ongoing business operations (as distinct from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General
Partner. Special Partners shall not be required to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts,
except (i) as a condition of an increase in such Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner
and any Special Partner may agree from time to time that such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided, further, that each Investor Special Partner
shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and
(ii) the total capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Interest. 
 (b) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (c) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional
Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital
Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by the General Partner. 
 28 

(d) (i) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement,
pursuant to which certain amounts of the distributions relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a
 Holdback ). The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld
percentage constituting the General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than the
General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than the General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback
Percentage for the General Partner and/or Holdings shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). 
 (ii) The Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her
Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is
decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to
Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any
individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the
General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback
Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to 24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any
increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the
Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased
Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 29 

(iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
General Partner may increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback
Vote provided , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided 
 further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased
unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or
assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not
be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. 
 (B) A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote
with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 
 (C) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject
Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided, that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory
arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided further, that if such candidates
fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that submits the decision of the
Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto,
and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into
an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of
funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses of such 
 30 

arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the
 victorious party shall be the Partnership if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the
Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (D) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) (A) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the
 Excess Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess
Holdback ), and such Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may
obtain the release of the Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback
obligation, by pledging, granting a security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess
Holdback obligation. Any Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the
General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s
books and records in which Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the
extent a first priority security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a second priority security
interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or
(y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the 
 31 

corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing
the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more
fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use
Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. (B) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm
Collateral (a Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy
such Excess Holdback requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy
such Excess Holdback requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (C) Upon any valuation or
revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm
Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback
requirement. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed
inapplicable to a default under this clause (C); provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party 
where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon
which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership to
distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required 
 32 

to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Partner or
Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are
rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1
by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the
Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier
than the latest possible termination date of SP Infrastructure III, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the
relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of
clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not
provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated
expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the
Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the
Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an
amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release
of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. (vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. 
 33 

(B) In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a
security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s books and records; provided, that the initial
contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such
Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess
amount from the Trust Account. (viii) (A) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of
his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein,
obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any
Excess Holdback) by pledging or otherwise granting a security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the
Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as
is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (B) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback)
is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust Account)), then
up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net
proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes
Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to
his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. 
 34 

(C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or
any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such
deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term
appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (D) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may revoke the ability of such
Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn
Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback). (E) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner from using any
amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided, that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or (iii) as
determined by the General Partner.

 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . 
 (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in Section 5.4. (b)
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) means: (i) from any activity of
the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Interest for any accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related Investments described below), (x) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items that are
deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined as provided below); 
 (ii) from any GP-Related Investment for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such
 GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related 
Investment (determined as provided below); and (iii) from any GP-Related 
Investment for the accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment is sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period
less (y) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. (c) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall
be determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxation and not
otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value in the books of the Partnership that differs from its
adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset in
the books of the Partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any
expenditures of the Partnership not deductible in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this
definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in
 
 36 

such GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect
expenses) of the Partnership, Holdings and other Affiliates of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partnership, Holdings and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related 
Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner. Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income
accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid, unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations)
and other appropriate items shall be made in accordance with GAAP; provided , that the General Partner shall not be required to make any such adjustment. 
 (d) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal Year, except that, at the option of the General Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a
new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the
General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to the Partners GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments to
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting
period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (e) In establishing
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate. (f) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under
this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all Withdrawn
Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any
successor thereto. Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be appropriate, one or
more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP
Infrastructure III Interest and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ). 
 37 

(b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the
Partnership by one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such
Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each
Partner shall be credited with the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest during such accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the
interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate
 GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be debited with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in
Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any property distributed to such Partner during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and
(y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated to such Partner for such accounting period. 
 Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages . 
 (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting period pursuant to
Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such
 GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (c) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately
prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end
of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. 
 38 

(b) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of any category for any annual accounting period at the time specified in Section 5.3(a) for the annual fixing of GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided ,
that any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner
within 90 days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) . 
 (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related Investment of all the Partners
participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than
amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to Partners that received Non-Carried 
Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP-Related Net Income is
being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts
representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. 
 (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP Infrastructure III and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on capital contributions made by
the Partnership to SP Infrastructure III with respect to the GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s
 Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP Infrastructure III and (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP Infrastructure III and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a
Partner s (including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 39 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above,
 GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be
allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such
 GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period unrelated to SP Infrastructure III, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such accounting period. (e) The
General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any
Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems
reasonably necessary for this purpose. Section 5.5. Liability of Partners . Except as otherwise provided in the
Partnership Act or as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall be personally obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner solely by reason of being a Partner. In no event shall any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner (i) be obligated to make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as
specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally Omitted] . 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investments as the General Partner may
determine. The General Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to
any Partner that is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other
requirements from time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 40 

Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) (i) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or
other property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing
Percentages. (ii) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP Infrastructure III of a portion
of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP Infrastructure III) relating to a GP-Related Disposable
Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP Infrastructure III) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income, and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 41 

(c) The General Partner may provide that the
 GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee (including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase
by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will
be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof (together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to
the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share
of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless
determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective
percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner;
 provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn
Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor
Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. 
 (d) (i) (A) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP Infrastructure III a
Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with
respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the
Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and
the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount
payable by the Partnership in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest
and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP Infrastructure III 
 42 

Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy
such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the
Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount pursuant
to an applicable SP Infrastructure III Agreement is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investment, all GP-Related SP Infrastructure III
Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if
applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs 
obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the
 GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as
reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential
obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account
used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days
after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. 
 (B) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or 
 43 

Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment hereunder
constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the SP Infrastructure III Partnership Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall
have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro
rata share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP Infrastructure III Partnership Agreement. 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the
General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a
 pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related 
Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a
 GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from
such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date
that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e),
no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net GP Related Recontribution Amount
initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. (B) Thereafter, the General Partner
shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good
faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership
expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such
 GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting
Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit 
 44 

thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (C) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related 
Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust
Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution before seeking cash
contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution. 
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute. 
 (iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating Losses (as defined in the SP
Infrastructure III Agreements) on GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who
participated in such Loss Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related 
SP Infrastructure III Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 45 

(i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in
connection with a GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP Infrastructure III Agreement as a result of one or more Loss
Investments, the General Partner shall calculate amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A)
determine each Partner s share of each such Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest
distributions otherwise available for distribution to all Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP Infrastructure III) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 (B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject
Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP Infrastructure III) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and 
 (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest
Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income Tax Rate (as defined in the SP Infrastructure
III Agreements) in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise
distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined
(as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net
Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be
allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. 
 46 

A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount
promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. 
 A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the
extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). Any Net Carried Interest Distribution
Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner, including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the
Subject Investment; provided , that any such amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such
distribution (taken together with the other Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the
case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses (as defined in the SP Infrastructure III Agreements) in any GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investment with
respect to which Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP Infrastructure III Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a 
 47 

Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains
after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro
rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). Any distribution or
contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any
adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners. It is agreed and
acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP Infrastructure III Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. (b) All items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in
accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are in
accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. 
 48 

(c) For U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain,
loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions
of this Section 5.10; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations have substantial economic effect or are in accordance with
the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority to any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an
adjustment to any Partner s distributive share thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined by the General Partner) in accordance with the final resolution of such audit
adjustment. ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms of such additional Partner s
participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution,
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time
unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special Partner ).
Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the
General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or
subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a GP-Related 
Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. 
 49 

(b) The GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if
any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages
as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the
Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any further act, vote or consent of any person, to make adjustments to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in
its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to other Partners of the Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. 
 (c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his or her pro rata share of the Partnership s total
capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times and in such amounts as shall be determined
by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. (d) The admission of an additional Partner will be
evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of this Agreement by such additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional Partner, as determined by the General Partner
and / or (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such writing being acceptable to the General
Partner on behalf of the Partnership. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the Trust Agreement that is acceptable to
the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner, including if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business. Without
limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less
than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided, that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership
with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from
the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. 
 (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any
Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. 
 50 

(c) Upon the Total Disability of a Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be
a Limited Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided, that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special Partner
with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether
any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall
nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such person s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If the
General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such
notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. (e) The Withdrawal
from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the
Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. 
 Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not Transferable . 
 (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided, that this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by operation of
law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further, that, subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust, limited
partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting
Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to the Partnership (including the
obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option 
 51 

exercisable at any time require any Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of
this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or otherwise) of the whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall
have any right to be a Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the
entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a Partner of the Partnership. (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof
to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state
securities laws. Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . 
 (a) Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its
right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute
General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided however, that the General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise)
and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of
liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner
and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as
contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or
more of such remaining Partners continue the business of the Partnership (any and all such remaining Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). Notwithstanding
Section 6.4(c), if upon the Withdrawal of a Partner there shall be no remaining Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be dissolved and shall be wound up unless, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Withdrawal, all remaining Special
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. 
 52 

(c) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any
Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interests . (a) The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For
purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined
under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Special
Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his or her Withdrawal Date;
 provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month in which his or her Withdrawal
Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related 
Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained a Partner of the Partnership during such
period. (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). 
 53 

(e) (i) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with
respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment)
and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph
(f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate
negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided, that if the Withdrawn Partner was
solely a Special Partner on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Special Partner, upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the General Partner as of
such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or
the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to
such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described
below, to receive a Nonvoting Special Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than
all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Investor Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. The election referred to
above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership
pursuant to this Section 6.5. 
 54 

(f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s
 percentage interest means his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn
Partner shall retain his or her percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable
to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn Partner shall become and remain a Special Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so
designates, such Special Partner shall be a Nonvoting Special Partner). The GP-Related Partner Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole
discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that
the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to this sentence. (g)
The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to paragraph (e) above, to (i) have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to
(ii) distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be
reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General
Partner. (h) [Intentionally omitted]. 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of
such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind distributions to be made
to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in respect of the settlement
of his or her GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above or
adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by
the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of
payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out 
 55 

of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with
all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within
one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner
as of the Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should prove, in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his
or her estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such deficiency, as the case may be. (k) Any amounts
owed by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after the Settlement Date e.g. , outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the
Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the
Partnership under this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at a floating rate equal to the lesser of (x) the Prime Rate or (y) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. The
 due date of amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in
respect of GP-Related Investments for which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph (f) above shall be 120 days after realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such amounts are determined to be payable. 
 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of a security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with
respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his or her GP-Related Partner Interest shall be settled in
accordance with paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5; provided , that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such
settlement: (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any
 GP-Related Investment in which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized
Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to 
 56 

the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related 
Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit
or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related 
Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment as of his or her
Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply the provisions of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss)
allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net
Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as
determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned on the compliance by such
Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a period not exceeding two
years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph (n) may elect to forfeit the
principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such restrictions. 
 (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the General Partner) a
discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. (p) The
provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Special Partner relating to a Limited Partner or Special Partner and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner

or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in
providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. 
 57 

(ii) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain
outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian,
as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere
with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (r) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful
agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner,
any and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5,
including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner.

term at any time on not less than 60 days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in

Partner shall determine all matters concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion. (b)
The General Partner shall cause to be prepared all federal, state and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such
returns to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States,
the several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making
any and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he or she shall not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his or her interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other
information statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his or her income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent
 
 58 

treatment. In respect of an income tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters
Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his or her decision shall be final and binding upon, the Partnership and all Partners except to the extent a Partner shall properly elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to
the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in connection therewith (including, without limitation, attorneys , accountants and other experts fees and disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and
(C) no Partner shall have the right to (1) participate in the audit of any Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any
tax return of the Partnership (unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising
out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner
or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and
each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as the partnership representative (as defined under the Code) (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions
of this Section 6.7 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. 
 (c) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each federal, state and local income tax return of such Partner
(including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. (d) To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines
that the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership holds an interest) is or may be required by law to withhold or to make tax payments, including interest and penalties on such amounts, on behalf of or with respect to any Partner,
including pursuant to Section 6225 of the Code Tax Advances ), the General Partner may withhold or escrow such amounts or make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner shall, at the option of
the General Partner, (i) be promptly paid to the Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would
otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option
(ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the
Partnership) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to 
 59 

indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest)
with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from the Partnership or any Transfer of a
Partner s interest. Section 6.8. Special Basis Adjustments . In connection with any assignment or transfer of a
Partnership interest permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the manner provided in Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.754-1(b), to make an election to adjust the basis of the Partnership s property in the manner provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.

 Section 7.1. Capital Commitment Interests, etc. 
 (a) (i) This Article VII and Article VIII hereof set forth certain terms and conditions with respect to the Capital Commitment Partner
Interests and the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Interest and matters related to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VII
or in Article VIII, the terms and provisions of this Article VII and Article VIII shall not apply to the GP-Related Partner Interests or the GP-Related SP Infrastructure
III Interest. (ii) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital
Commitment-Related Capital Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to SP Infrastructure III in respect of the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Interest, if any, and the related Capital
Commitment SP Infrastructure III Commitment, if any (including, without limitation, funding all or a portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment). No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the
Partnership in an amount in excess of such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood
that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each Capital Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment, or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way
limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing
contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal
to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 60 

(b) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing
Party may in its sole discretion advance to any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any
portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions due to the Partnership from such Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Partner shall pay interest to the Advancing
Party on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the
Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party
absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such
rate upon such Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant
to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of
Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed
the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. 
 61 

Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be
allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 7.7
shall be specially allocated to the electing Partner. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as
it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments,
distributions to such Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including, without limitation, Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests)
during a Fiscal Year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such Fiscal Year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole discretion of the
General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected
by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): (i) First, to the
payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise) of such Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all
interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 62 

(ii) Second, to distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S.
federal, state and local income taxes on income of the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by
the General Partner, subject to the limitation that the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were
all allocated to an individual subject to the then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes (including, without limitation, taxes imposed under Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character
of such taxable income allocated by the Partnership and the limitations on deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes); provided, that additional amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this clause
(ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant
partnership or other entity; provided further, that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to
provisions in such other BE Agreements that are comparable to this clause (ii); (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the
principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year or (B) any BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such
Fiscal Year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Partner of (A) all
Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any
Blackstone Entity (other than the Partnership) in respect of interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related
Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); 
 (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal (including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of
such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; 
 63 

(vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after
application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such
Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; and 
 (vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after making the
distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to
clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed
to such Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the discretion of the General Partner.
At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period
in respect of which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). 
 64 

(f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a
Capital Commitment Investment is being considered by the Partnership or SP Infrastructure III (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest
with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s
 Capital Commitment Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s
 Capital Commitment Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment
Disposable Investment shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such
Capital Commitment Class B Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital
Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating
to such Capital Commitment Class A Interests. (g) (i) If the Partnership is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to
contribute to SP Infrastructure III a Giveback Amount with respect to any Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a
 Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn
Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Interest (the Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment
Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Investments other than the one giving rise to such
obligation and (c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP Infrastructure III Agreement is unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III Investment, all Capital Commitment SP Infrastructure III
Investments. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s discretion (but shall
be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such
obligations). 
 65 

(ii) (A) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment
Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect
any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital
Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a
 Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment
of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital
Commitment Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner s in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General
Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the
good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not
ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the
Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment
from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name
of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (B) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (iii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the
Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. 
 66 

Section 7.5. Valuations . Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued
annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any other Affiliate of the Partnership that is a general partner of SP
Infrastructure III) in valuing investments of SP Infrastructure III or, in the case of investments not held by SP Infrastructure III, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the immediately
succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided, that the
Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further, that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating solely to
the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control of the
underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further, that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any Capital Commitment
Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member or partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. 
 Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such
Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the
Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not
be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 67 

(b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes
relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. ARTICLE VIII
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as
 Non-Contingent for purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment
Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount
of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided, that in the
event that a Partner prepays all or any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, the Partnership (or its
designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further, that the purchase price for such
Capital Commitment Interest shall be determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Partner shall
apply pro rata against all of such Partner s Investor Notes; provided, that such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Entities specified
by such Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests.
 (b) (i) Upon a Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of
such Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its
designee(s) within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership (subject to the prior consent of the General
Partner, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by
the Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 68 

(ii) The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest
shall be an amount equal to (A) the outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the
 Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to be
repurchased, plus (y) all Capital Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on
the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest; provided, that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment
Amount, in the General Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital
Commitment Net Income received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative, it shall be
payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s
Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or (B) if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided, that the Partnership and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a
Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment
Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. (iii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an
officer or employee, all Investor Notes shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of
the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). (iv) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the
Partnership nor its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor
Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the
Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the Partnership shall apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. 
 69 

(v) To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital
Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. 
 (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and
the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant
to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time, in the manner and
in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise
and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon
the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General
Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. 
 (d) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the
Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability) (and the purchase price for such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be
determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully
recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, so requests in writing within 180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing
to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership or its designee may but is not obligated to
purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then current Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital
Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his or her will to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership
may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, within 30 days of the first date on 
 70 

which the General Partner knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate,
personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a
Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an
employee or officer of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying
such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Partner or another Affiliate of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined in good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase).
The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph (d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate
irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. (f) The Partnership may subsequently
transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital
Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the
designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are
repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner
already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment
Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent
that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or (ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital
Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal 
 71 

amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as
provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree; provided, that such indebtedness shall become fully recourse to the extent and at the time
provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be non-recourse or so limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Partners of such
indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Partners; provided, that a Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor Note(s), be obligated to accept any
obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this Section 8.1), unless his or her prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause
(iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the
Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion his or her aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. 
 (g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for
Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1; provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a
direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interest); (ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain such
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment
shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof;
or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory
note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. 
 72 

(h) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the
case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her
estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to
Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such
professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without
limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General
Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided, that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn Partner s or Deceased or Totally Disabled
Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another Partner of
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any
reason therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning Vehicle (it
being understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General Partner in
connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General Partner shall
designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Partner and such Nonvoting
Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment- 
 73 

Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of
Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership,
unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire
Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Section 8.3. Compliance with Law .
Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state
securities laws. ARTICLE IX 
 DISSOLUTION 
 Section 9.1. Dissolution . The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (a) pursuant to Section 6.6; or 
 (b) upon the expiration of the term of the Partnership. 
 Section 9.2. Final Distribution . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, and following the payment of creditors of the
Partnership and the making of provisions for the payment of any contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the Partnership as required under the Partnership Act: 
 (a) The Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the GP-Related Capital Account
balances of the Partners; and (b) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to
such Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment
Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment;
and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. The General Partner shall be the liquidator. In the
event that the General Partner is unable to serve as liquidator, a liquidating trustee shall be chosen by the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Partners voting at a meeting of Partners (excluding Nonvoting Special Partners). 
 74 

Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner
Interests . (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests which, in the judgment of the liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest
in each such Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or
her pro rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the liquidator shall determine. 
 (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to
such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may
meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on
account of such transaction or claim. (c) Upon determination by the liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion of any
Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such Securities
or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . (a) Any and all disputes which cannot be settled
amicably, including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement

the existence of the Partnership or at or after its termination or during or after the liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York U.S.A., in accordance
with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the
International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration
proceedings. 
 75 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may
cause the Partnership to bring, on behalf of the General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate,
seeking temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this
Section 10.1 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate,
and (iii) irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who shall promptly advise such
Partner of any such service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Partner in any such action or proceeding. 
 (c) (i) EACH PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY
JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT.
Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the forum(s)
designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another. 
 (ii) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such
invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act
or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 76 

Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Blackstone Name . The Partnership
acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ), a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive
owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and that the ownership of, and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM,
which company (or its predecessors, successors or assigns) has licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the
BLACKSTONE mark and name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and
authorized activities with the permission of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for
the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly
following any such termination, the Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar
thereto as a service mark or otherwise. Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a
vote of Partners at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing.

entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners, officers or employees with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, benefits or any
other matter, which letter agreements have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing, the terms of this Agreement with respect to any such Partner and such matters. The parties hereto agree that any rights established, or
any terms of this Agreement altered or supplemented, in any such separate letter agreement, including any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, shall govern solely with respect to such Partner notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.
The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever; provided,
that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. 
 77 

Section 10.5. Governing Law , Separability of Provisions . This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and
liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law
and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party
Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a
trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided, that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have any
rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any

 ARTICLE IV CAPITAL OF THE
PARTNERSHIP Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . (a) Each Partner shall be required to make capital
contributions to the Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required
Amounts as are required to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP RA II in respect of the GP-Related SP RA II Interest with respect to any GP-Related SP RA II Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any; provided,
that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each
Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing
business operations as distinct from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d)) shall be determined by the General Partner. Limited
Partners shall not be required to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a
condition of an increase in such Limited Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner and any Limited Partner
may agree from time to time that such Limited Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided, further, that each Investor Limited Partner shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total capital
of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RA II Interest. (b) The General Partner may elect
on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or
any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership
pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in
installments, in each case on terms determined by the General Partner. 
 32 

(c) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a
Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (d) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which certain amounts of distributions relating
to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a Holdback ). 
 (i) The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall
be withheld for any General Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner) and each Partner Category (such withheld percentage constituting a General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback
Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than any General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than any General Partner) and 5 for
Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for any General Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner) shall not
be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). (ii) The Holdback Percentage
may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories
on a proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in
the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. 
 (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her
Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners 
Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to
24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to
distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback
Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have
the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 33 

(iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
General Partner may increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to the a majority vote of the Limited Partners and the General Partner (a
 Holdback Vote provided , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent;
 provided further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or
(II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an
amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for such Subject Partner s Partner Category; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject
Partner s successors or assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive
distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. 
 (B) A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners and the General Partner shall be
entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 
 (C) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject
Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided, that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory
arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided further, that if such candidates
fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that submits the decision of the
Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto and
each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an
escrow account to be controlled by Simpson Thacher Bartlett LLP, as escrow agent (or such other comparable law firm as the Partnership and the Subject 
 34 

Partner shall agree). The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return
to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such
 losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party shall be the Partnership, if the Holdback Percentage
ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the
 victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (D) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) (A) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the
 Excess Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess
Holdback ), and such Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may
obtain the release of the Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback
obligation, by pledging, granting a security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess
Holdback obligation. Any Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the
General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that in the case of entities listed in the books and records
of the Partnership, in which Partners/members are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ),
to the extent a first priority security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn 
 35 

Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a second priority security interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that
(x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a
security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the
relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the books and records of the Partnership to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully
provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm
Collateral as provided hereunder. (B) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a
 Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner
or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess
Holdback requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess
Holdback requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of
Firm Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral
Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback requirement. If
any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default
under this clause (C); provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears
in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 36 

(vi) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the
release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for
the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C
from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P and P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less) or
(y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below
the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient
L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP RA II, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank
whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may
(as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under the Clawback
Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the termination of the
Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder); or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback obligation in cash and/or
Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of such L/C Partner, the
L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership; provided ,
that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 (vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried
Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any
time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. 
 37 

(B) In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge with respect
to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the books and records of the Partnership; provided, that the initial contribution of such Special Firm
Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback Amount for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm
Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback Amount specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount
from the Trust Account. (viii) (A) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his or
her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a
release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) by pledging or granting a security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback
distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is
necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (B) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback)
is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust Account)), then
up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net
proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to 
 38 

such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner
or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. 
 (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral
Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the books and records of the Partnership), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral valued at less than such Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) as provided in the books and records of the Partnership, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within
10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner
defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to such default; provided further, that for purposes
of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as
 defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution
Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (D) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may revoke the ability of such
Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn
Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback). (E) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner from using any
amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided, that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 39 

Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital
related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement or (iii) as determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V 
 PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES 
 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . 
 (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in Section 5.4. (b)
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any activity of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RA II Interest for any accounting period means
(i) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items that are deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are
allocable to such activity (determined as provided below). (c) GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) from any GP-Related Investment for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of means
(i) the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership for
such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment (determined as provided below). 
 (d) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any
 GP-Related Investment for the accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment is sold or otherwise disposed of means (i) the sum of the gross proceeds from
the sale or other disposition of such GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related 
Investment during such accounting period less (ii) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that
are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. GP-Related Net Income (Loss)
shall be determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for Federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from Federal income taxation and not otherwise
taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value on the books of the Partnership that differs from its adjusted tax
basis for Federal income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset on the books of the
Partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any expenditures of
the Partnership not deductible 
 40 

in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to
this definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in such GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership and Affiliates of the Partnership shall be allocated among the
Partnership and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner. Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid, unrealized losses, reserves
(including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items, shall be made in accordance with GAAP; provided , that the General Partner shall not
be required to make any such adjustment. (e) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal Year except that, at the option of the General
Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event
referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to the Partners 
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments
to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting
period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (f) In establishing
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate. (g) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under
this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all Withdrawn
Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any
successor thereto. 
 41 

Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital
Accounts . (a) There shall be established for each Partner on the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be
appropriate, one or more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the
 GP-Related SP RA II Interest and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital
Account ). (b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one or more of
the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited with the
following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RA II Interest during such accounting
period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be debited
with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any property distributed to such Partner
during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and (y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated to such Partner for such
accounting period. Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages . 
 (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting period pursuant to
Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , however , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (b) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (b) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately
prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end
of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. 
 42 

(b) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of any category for any annual accounting period at the time specified in Section 5.3(a) for the annual fixing of GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided ,
that any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner
within 90 days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) . 
 (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related Investment of all the Partners
participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than
amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners, second, to Partners that received Non-Carried 
Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP-Related Net Income is
being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts
representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. 
 (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP RA II and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on capital contributions made by the
Partnership to SP RA II with respect to the GP-Related SP RA II Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP RA II and (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses
suffered by SP RA II and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s (including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such
loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 43 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above,
 GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be
allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such
 GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period unrelated to SP RA II, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such accounting period. (e) The
General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any
Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). 
 Section 5.5. Liability of General Partners . General Partners shall have unlimited liability for the satisfaction and
discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. Section 5.6. Liability of Limited Partners . Each
Limited Partner and former Limited Partner shall be liable for the satisfaction and discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership allocable to him or her pursuant to Section 5.4 or Section 7.3, but only to the extent
required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, in no event shall any Limited Partner or former Limited Partner be obligated to make any additional capital contribution to the Partnership in excess of his or her
aggregate GP-Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions pursuant to Section 4.1 and Section 7.1, or have any liability in excess of such aggregate GP-Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions for the satisfaction and discharge of the losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. In no way does any of the
foregoing limit any Partner s obligations under Section 4.1(d), Section 5.8(d) or Section 7.4(g) or otherwise to make capital contributions as provided hereunder. 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP RA II Investments as the General Partner may determine. The
General Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that
is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 44 

Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) (i) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or
other property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing
Percentages. (ii) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP RA II of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RA II) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RA II) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such
 GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total Federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of federal, New York State and New York City income and other tax rates, (ii) taking into account the deductibility of State and local income and other taxes for Federal income tax purposes
and (iii) taking into account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
sentence, the General Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by the Partnership Act. 
 45 

(c) The General Partner may provide that the
 GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee (including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase
by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will
be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof (together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to
the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share
of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless
determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective
percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner;
 provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn
Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor
Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. 
 (d) (i) (A) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP RA II a Clawback
Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP RA II Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a
Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership, as
determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund
GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate
Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership, in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of
Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP RA II Investment giving rise to the
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP RA II Investments 
 46 

other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP RA II Investment
referred to in clause (II)(a) above and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP RA II Investment, all GP-Related SP RA II Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such
call, such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant
to written instructions from the General Partner, or if applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of
 GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be
sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount and/or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall
be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General
Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any
amount from a Partner s Trust Account used to pay any part of any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such
Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. Solely to the
extent required by the SP RA II Agreements, each member of the General Partner shall have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this
Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) solely with respect to such member s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount (for purposes of this sentence, as defined in the SP RA II Partnership Agreement) and solely to the
extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP RA II Partnership Agreements (and/or the corresponding provisions under any other SP RA II Agreement). 
 (B) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such 
 47 

Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions,
if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this
clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under
Section 5.8(d)(ii). (ii) (A) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting
Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such
amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the
Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of
the amount of the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 (B) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not
attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or
equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the
 GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, 
 48 

upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn
Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required
to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. (C) Any Partner s or Withdrawn
Partner s failure to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to
such amount. The Partnership shall first seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution. (iii) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e)
The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners,
including by allocating writedowns and losses (to be determined by the General Partner in accordance with GAAP and as reported by SP RA II) on GP-Related SP RA II Investments that have been the subject of a
writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received
Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related SP RA II Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set
forth in this Section 5.8(e). (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection
with a GP-Related SP RA II Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP RA II Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall
calculate amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share of
each such Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution
to all Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RA II) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 49 

(B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise
distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RA II) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest
Distributions and (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the
Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income Tax Rate in effect in the Fiscal Years of such
distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such
amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried
Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined (as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner
becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner
remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on
each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest
Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. 
 A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the
extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 50 

Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner,
including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such
amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried
Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be
contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses in any GP-Related SP RA II
Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP RA II Investment with respect to which Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such
Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP RA II Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 
 51 

It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the
Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP RA II Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. (b) For Federal, State and
local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each fiscal year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are
allocated among the Partners pursuant to clause (a) above; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations have substantial
economic effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. 
 ARTICLE VI ADDITIONAL PARTNERS;
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as General Partners or Limited Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.7 and Section 3.8. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner all terms of such additional Partner s participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s
initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Limited Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such
Limited Partner 
 52 

shall not have such voting rights (any such Limited Partner being called a Nonvoting Limited Partner ). Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree
to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a
Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment
Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a GP-Related Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other
such interest. (b) The GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an
additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date,
shall be established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with
the pro rata reduction in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner. 
 (c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his or her pro rata share of the Partnership s total
capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times and in such amounts as shall be determined
by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. (d) The admission of an additional Partner will be
evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of, or counter-signature page with respect to, this Agreement by such additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional
Partner, as determined by the General Partner or (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a substitute or additional Limited Partner and to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement and such writing being accepted by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to
become a party to the Trust Agreement. Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner. The General Partner
generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner
to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided , that a Partner may not voluntarily Withdraw without the consent of the General Partner if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership
 
 53 

or its business; provided further , that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner
Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest
without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. 
 (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any
Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. (c) Upon the Total Disability of a
Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided , however , that the General Partner may elect
to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related 
Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the
absence of agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If
the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest,
such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. (e) The
Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all
obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. 
 Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not Transferable . 
 (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without the prior written consent of the General Partner; provided , that, subject to the Partnership Act, this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by
operation of law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers 
 54 

required by trust agreements; provided further , that, subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may
transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust, limited partnership or limited liability company with respect to which such
Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting
Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as
provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(a), no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or otherwise) of the whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a General Partner or Limited Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion
without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire partnership interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a partner of the Partnership. 
 (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related 
Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. General Partner Withdrawal; Transfer of General Partner s Interest . 
 (a) The General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its right to manage the affairs of
the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, with the prior written approval of a Majority In Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute General Partner who makes such representations with respect to
itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided , however , that the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in
the Partership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise) and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal
part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of liability for all the obligations of the General Partner
under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the
Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a
security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. 
 55 

(b) Except as contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is
not permitted. The Withdrawal of a General Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining General Partners, and any one or more of such remaining General Partners continue the business of
the Partnership (any and all such remaining General Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). If upon the Withdrawal of a General Partner there shall be no
remaining General Partner, the Partnership nonetheless shall not be dissolved and shall not be required to be wound up if, within 90 days after the occurrence of such event of Withdrawal, all remaining Limited Partners (excluding Withdrawn Partners)
agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more General Partners. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest . (a) The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For
purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined
under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Limited
Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his or her Withdrawal Date;
 provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month in which his or her Withdrawal
Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related 
Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained a Partner of the Partnership during such
period. (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner with respect to such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall, promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. 
 56 

(d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner, the Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related 
Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided in paragraph (f) below). 
 (e) (i) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss) or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment)
and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph
(f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(p) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate
negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided , that if the Withdrawn Partner
was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Partner) on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative
balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Partner), upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance
with their respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the
General Partner as of such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill,
the Partnership name or the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to
such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described
below, to receive a Nonvoting Limited Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than
all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. The election referred to above shall
be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to
this Section 6.5. 
 57 

(f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s
 percentage interest means his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn
Partner shall retain his or her percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable
to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn Partner shall become and remain a Limited Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so
designates, such Limited Partner shall be a Nonvoting Limited Partner). The GP-Related Partner Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole
discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that
the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to this sentence. (g)
The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to paragraph (e) above, (i) to have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or
(ii) to distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be
reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General
Partner. (h) [Intentionally omitted]. 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of
such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind distributions to be made
to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in respect of the settlement
of his or her GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above or
adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by
the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be
 
 58 

subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising
out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and
whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the
Withdrawn Partner in question. (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date in making the
foregoing calculations should prove, in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess, or to charge
the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such deficiency, as the case may be. (k) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn Partner to the
Partnership at any time on or after the Settlement Date e.g. , outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner at
any time on or after the Settlement Date or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under this Section 6.5

interest permitted by applicable law. The due date of amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts
payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in respect of GP-Related Investments for which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph (f) above shall be 120 days after
realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such amounts are determined to be payable.
 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in
the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of a security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with
respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his or her GP-Related Partner Interest shall be settled in
accordance with paragraphs (a)-(q) of this Section 6.5; provided , however , that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and
conditions to such settlement: 
 59 

(i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any GP-Related Investment in which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized Net
Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn
Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her
 GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply
the provisions of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any
 GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The
Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned on the compliance by such
Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a period not exceeding two
years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph (n) may elect to forfeit the
principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such restrictions. 
 (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the General Partner) a
discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Limited Partner relating to another Limited Partner,
and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner pursuant to Section 6.3, if such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership. 
 (p) (i) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate.
 
 60 

(ii) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain
outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian,
as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere
with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (q) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful
agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner,
any and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5,
including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 6.6. Termination of the Partnership . The General Partner may dissolve the Partnership at any time on not less than 60
days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in

 Section 6.7. Certain Tax Matters . (a) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be
allocated among the Partners for Federal, State and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be
provided herein or by the Code or other applicable law. To the extent U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Subchapter K of the Code (including under Sections 704(b) and (c) of the Code) or other applicable law require allocations
for tax purposes that differ from the foregoing allocations, the General Partner may determine the manner in which such tax allocations shall be made so as to comply more fully with such Treasury Regulations or other applicable law and, at the same
time, preserve the economic relationships among the Partners as set forth in this Agreement. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of
Regulations Sections 1.704 2(d) and 1.704 2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its
respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Regulations Sections 1.704 2(g) and 1.704 2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704 2(f). In addition,
this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
 61 

(b) The General Partner shall cause to be prepared all Federal, State and local tax returns
of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment
of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item
or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he or she shall
not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his or her interest in the Partnership in a
manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his or her
income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of an income tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended
return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit,
amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his or her decision shall be final and binding upon, the Partnership and all Partners except to the
extent a Partner shall properly elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in connection therewith (including, without limitation, attorneys , accountants and
other experts fees and disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and (C) no Partner shall have the right to (1) participate in the audit of any Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended return or claim for refund in
connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership (unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or
judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse
findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial
proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as the tax matters partner for purposes of Section 6231(a)(7) of the
Code (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.7 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. 
 62 

(c) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each Federal, State
and local income tax return of such Partner (including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return.

terms and provisions of this Article VII and Article VIII shall not apply to the GP-Related Partner Interests or the GP-Related SP RA II Interest. 
 (ii) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related
Capital Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s direct or indirect capital contributions to SP RA II, in respect of the Capital Commitment SP RA II Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP RA II Commitment,
if any. No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in an amount in excess of such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if
any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each Capital Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing
Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the Partnership s portion of the Capital Commitment SP RA II Commitment, if any or (ii) the
making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any
Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms upon which the General Partner and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The
acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such
appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time.

(b) The General Partner or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing
Party may in its sole discretion advance to any Limited Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or
any Affiliate thereof) all or any portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions due to the Partnership from such Limited Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such
Limited Partner shall pay to the Advancing Party interest on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm Advance until the repayment thereof by such Limited Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the
date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm
Advance, binding on the Limited Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such
Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Limited Partner of such rate upon such Limited Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law;
 provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Limited Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion,
change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Limited Partners of any material changes to such
terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. 
 Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner on the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. 
 64 

Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be
allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 7.7
shall be specially allocated to the electing Limited Partner. Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Limited Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments,
distributions to such Limited Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including without limitation Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment
Interests) during a fiscal year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such fiscal year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole
discretion of the General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Limited Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership (or in each case on
such earlier date as selected by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): 
 (i) First, to the payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise)
of such Limited Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all interest payments due, the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes upon which
interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Limited Partner of an amount equal to the Federal, State and local income taxes on income
of the Partnership allocated to such Limited Partner for such year in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to
the limitation that the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all
 
 65 

allocated to an individual subject to the then-prevailing maximum Federal, New York State and New York City tax rates (taking into account the extent to
which such taxable income allocated by the Partnership was composed of long-term capital gains and the deductibility of State and local income taxes for Federal income tax purposes)); provided , that
additional amounts shall be paid to the Limited Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Limited Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BCE Agreement
and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further , that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BCE Agreements comparable to the
immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Limited Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BCE Agreements that are comparable to this clause (ii); 
 (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital Commitment
Investment disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year or (B) any BCE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; 
 (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Limited Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in
respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Collateral Entity (other than the Partnership)
in respect of interests therein relating to BCE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from
amounts of Other Sources (other than amounts of CC Carried Interest); (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal (including
any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Limited Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of
payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital
Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Limited Partner (including those unrelated to the
Partnership), the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined
by the Lender or Guarantor; and (vii) Seventh, to such Limited Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment
Net Income remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 66 

To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other
BCE Investment, as applicable, the payments in clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BCE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest
payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Limited Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone,
distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the General Partner or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect
of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Limited Partner, until all such Limited Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any
such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed to such Limited Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net
Income may be made at any other time at the discretion of the General Partner. At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Limited Partner in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will
be net of any interest and principal payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period in respect of which the distribution is made. A distribution of Capital Commitment Net Income to the General Partner shall be made contemporaneously with
each distribution of Capital Commitment Net Income to or for the accounts of the Limited Partners. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Limited Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a Capital Commitment Investment
is being considered by the Partnership or SP RA II (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to such Capital Commitment
Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a 
 67 

Partner s Capital Commitment Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other
disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective
Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership)
relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with
their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class A Interests. (g) (i)
If the Partnership is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP RA II all or a portion of a Giveback Amount with respect to the Capital Commitment SP RA II Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership being herein
called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and
Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP RA II Interest (the Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP RA II Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount,
or (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP RA II Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation. Each Partner
shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation
to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or
any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such
 GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment
Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment
Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution
be required to contribute an amount in excess of 
 68 

150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good
faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as
appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner
hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the
Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may
be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such
Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (B) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (iii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the
Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5. Valuations .
Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any Affiliate of the
Partnership that is a general partner of SP RA II) in valuing investments of SP RA II or, in the case of investments not held by SP RA II, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the
immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided,
that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further, that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating
solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control
of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further, that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any Capital
Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member of a General Partner. 
 69 

Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such
Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the
Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not
be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to
or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution.

ARTICLE VIII 
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Limited Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as not subject to repurchase for
purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note
to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest
which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Limited Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided , that in the event that a Limited Partner prepays all or
any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Limited Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone, the Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further , that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest
shall be determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Limited Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Limited Partner shall apply pro
rata against all of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes; provided , that such Limited Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BCE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone
Collateral Entities specified by such Limited Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. (b) Upon a Limited Partner ceasing to be an officer
or employee of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such Limited Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Limited Partner (the Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership or any other
person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s) within 45 days of such Limited Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or
employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership, subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to
sell (in the case of exercise of such right by the Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment
Interest will be an amount equal to (i) the outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be made in cash) and (ii) an additional
amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Limited Partner on the portion of the principal amount of the Investor Note relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent
plus (y) all Capital Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent
portion of such Capital Commitment Interest; provided, that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, the amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the
General Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net
Income received by such holders on the Contingent portion of 
 71 

such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount resulting from an exchange is negative, it shall be
payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests or, if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided, that the General Partner and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a
Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment
Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercise the right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the
Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity, shall be
payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the General Partner shall apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a
pro rata basis. To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for
such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any
Limited Partner, such Limited Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Limited Partner
shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive
any distributions and allocations with respect to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of
such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time, in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Limited Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be
acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership
as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General Partner shall be entitled to treat any
Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. 
 72 

(d) (d) If a Limited Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s death or Total Disability) as provided
in Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to the estate or personal representative in cash), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided
in Section 8.1(b). In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Limited Partner, if the estate or personal representative of such Limited Partner so requests in writing within 180 days of the Limited Partner s death or
ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership or its designee may but is not
obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Limited Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then current fiscal year at a price
equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. Each Limited Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his will to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General
Partner, upon notice to the estate or personal representative of such Limited Partner within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either
(i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate or personal representative in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to
require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General
Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn
Partner as a Limited Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her
ceasing to be an employee or officer of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or
other property underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in
satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the
General Partner in its sole discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Limited Partner or another Affiliate of the General Partner) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such
Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting
Securities pursuant to paragraph (d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to
such Securities. (f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is
purchased by it as described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General Partner s designee(s),
Blackstone may loan all or a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding
any of the foregoing who is an executive officer 
 73 

of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not
transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital
Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment and/or (iii) continue to
be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest
is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or (ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to
Limited Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Limited Partners receiving such
allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as such Limited Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree. If the indebtedness
financing such repurchased interests is not so limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Limited Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such
Limited Partners; provided, that a Limited Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor Note, be obligated to accept any personally recourse obligation unless his or her prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself
retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall
be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be
allocated to each Partner in the proportion his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the
Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. (g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to
such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interests shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1;
 provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct member of a General Partner, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof; 
 74 

(ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment shall
equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof; or
(iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory note
shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. (h) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn
Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will
be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside
professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the
case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with
the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably appoints each General Partner as such Limited Partner s true and lawful agent, representative
and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Limited Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Limited Partner, any
and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1,
including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Limited Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Limited Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive
and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Limited Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Limited Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Without the prior written consent
of the General Partner, no Limited Partner or former Limited Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided, that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn Partner s
or deceased or Totally Disabled Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Limited Partner to another Limited Partner
of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any
reason therefor and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not 
 75 

be unreasonably withheld, Transfers, for estate planning purposes, of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning Vehicle. Each Estate Planning
Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the
interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the
Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Limited Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such Partner s right to participate
in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Limited Partner shall not cease to be a limited partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or the
pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire limited partner interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no Transfer of a Capital Commitment
Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all Federal, State and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws. 
 ARTICLE IX DISSOLUTION 
 Section 9.1. Dissolution . 
 (a) The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (i) pursuant to Section 6.6; 
 (ii) upon the expiration of the Term; or 
 (iii) upon the occurrence of a Disabling Event with respect to the last remaining General Partner; provided , that the
Partnership shall not be dissolved if, within 90 days after the Disabling Event, Limited Partners entitled to vote thereon as provided herein who, as of the last day of the most recent accounting period ending on or prior to the date of the
Disabling Event, have aggregate GP-Related Capital Account balances representing at least a majority in amount of the total GP-Related Capital Account balances of all
the persons who are Limited Partners entitled to vote thereon as provided herein agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of the Disabling Event, of another General Partner. 
 (b) When the Partnership is dissolved, the business and property of the Partnership shall be wound up and liquidated by the General Partner
or, in the event of the unavailability of the General Partner, such Limited Partner or other liquidating trustee as shall be named by the Designated Limited Partner (the General Partner, such Limited Partner or other liquidating trustee, as the case
may be, being hereinafter referred to as the Liquidator ). 
 76 

Section 9.2. Final Distribution . 
 (a) Within 120 calendar days after the effective date of dissolution of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership shall be distributed in
the following manner and order: (i) to the payment of the expenses of the
 winding-up, liquidation and dissolution of the Partnership; (ii) to pay all
creditors of the Partnership, other than Partners, either by the payment thereof or the making of reasonable provision therefor; 
 (iii) to establish reserves, in amounts established by the General Partner or the Liquidator, to meet other liabilities of the
Partnership; and (iv) to pay, in accordance with the terms agreed among them and otherwise on a pro rata basis, all creditors of the Partnership that are Partners, either by the payment thereof or the making of reasonable provision
therefor. (b) The remaining assets of the Partnership shall be applied and distributed among the Partners as follows: 
 (i) With respect to each Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the remaining
assets of the Partnership shall be applied and distributed to such Partner in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the capital accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the
capital account balances of the Partners; and for purposes of the application of this Section 9.2(b)(i), determining GP-Related Capital Accounts on liquidation, all unrealized gains, losses and accrued
income and deductions of the Partnership shall be treated as realized and recognized immediately before the date of distribution; and (ii) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to such
Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment
Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment;
and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to
Capital Commitment Partner Interests . (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to
the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests which, in the judgment of the Liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value
of a Partner s interest in each such Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed 
 77 

to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro rata 
interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the Liquidator shall determine. 
 (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the Liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to
such Partner pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the Liquidator shall determine.
The Partnership may meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the Liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable
loss or liability on account of such transaction or claim. (c) Upon determination by the Liquidator that circumstances no longer require
the exclusion of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the Liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in clause (ii) of
Section 9.2(b) such sums or such Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . (a) Any and all disputes which cannot be settled
amicably, including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement
(including the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision), shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York U.S.A. in accordance with the
 then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the
request for arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably
possible during any arbitration proceedings. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may
cause the Partnership to bring, on behalf of the General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate,
seeking temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this
Section 10.1 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be 
 78 

difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate and (iii) irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with
any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who shall promptly advise such Partner of any such service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Partner in any such
action or proceeding. (c) (i) EACH PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR
CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties
acknowledge that the forum(s) designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another. 
 (ii) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such
invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act
or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Firm Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ), a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and
that the ownership of, and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors,
successors or assigns) has licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the permission
of TM. All services 
 79 

rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the
BLACKSTONE mark by TM and its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly
following any such termination, the Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar
thereto as a service mark or otherwise. Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a
vote of Partners at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. 
 Section 10.4. Letter Agreements; Schedules . The General Partner may, or may cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously
entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages or any other matter. The General Partner
may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners Schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages of
the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such Schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever; provided that this in no way limits
the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement. Section 10.5. Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware , without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners
shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of this
Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a trustee of a trust which is or
becomes a party hereto; provided, that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect to, a
Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall
remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any transferee of all or any portion of such
Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based on the standards set forth in
Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and Section 7.4(g)(ii)(A), to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or Capital
 
 80 

Commitment Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights,
legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the SP RA II Agreements, (x) the
limited partners in SP VIII shall be third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this
sentence, as defined in Section 9.4(a) of the SP RA II Partnership Agreement) and (y) the amendment of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate
to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in Section 9.4(a) of the SP RA II Partnership Agreement), in a manner materially adverse to such limited partners shall be effective against such limited partners only with the 66 2 3 Combined Limited Partner Consent (as such term is used in the SP RA II Partnership Agreement). 
 Section 10.7. Partner s Will . Each Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall include in his or her will
a provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligation relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner, and each such Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in
writing, that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Limited Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Interest is transferred
shall include a provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its substantial equivalent remains in such trust. In the event any Limited
Partner or Withdrawn Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.7 after the Partnership has notified such Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner of his or her failure to so comply and such failure to so comply is not cured
within 30 days of such notice, the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner until the time at which such party complies with the requirements of this Section 10.7. 
 Section 10.8. Confidentiality . 
 (a) By executing this Agreement, each Partner expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or
not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than the Partnership, another Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business,
financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally known to the public or the securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided , however , that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law, rule, regulation or custom to disclose.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee, representative or other agent of such Partner)
may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the name of, or any other identifying information
regarding (a) the Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any performance information relating to any of the
Partners or their investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax structure information. 
 81 

Section 10.9. Notices . Whenever notice is required or permitted by this
Agreement to be given, such notice shall be in writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be given by hand delivery (including any courier service) or telecopy to any Partner at its address or telecopy number shown in the books and
records of the Partnership or, if given to the General Partner or the Partnership, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch and
(ii) if given by hand delivery, when delivered to the address of such Partner or the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. 
 Section 10.10. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original
and all of which together shall constitute a single instrument. Section 10.11. Power of Attorney . Each Partner hereby
irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name,
place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file all instruments, documents and certificates which, from time to time, may be required to set forth any amendment to this Agreement or may be required by this Agreement or by the laws of the United
States of America, the State of Delaware or any other state in which the Partnership shall determine to do business, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, to execute, implement and continue the valid and subsisting existence of the
Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the subsequent Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the
subsequent disability or incapacity of such Partner. Section 10.12. Cumulative Remedies . Rights and remedies under this
Agreement are cumulative and do not preclude use of other rights and remedies available under applicable law. 
 Section 10.13. Legal Fees . Except as more specifically provided herein, in the event of a legal dispute (including
litigation, arbitration or mediation) between any Partner or Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership, arising in connection with any party seeking to enforce Section 4.1(d) or any other provision of this Agreement relating to the Holdback, the
Clawback Amount, the GP-Related Giveback Amount, the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount or the Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount, the losing party to such dispute shall promptly reimburse the victorious party for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute (such determination to be made by the
relevant adjudicator). Any amounts due under this Section 10.13 shall be paid within 30 days of the date upon which such amounts are due to be paid and such amounts remaining unpaid after such date shall accrue interest at the Default Interest
Rate. 
 82 

Section 10.14. Entire Agreement . This Agreement embodies the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or referred to
herein. Subject to Section 10.4, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. 
 83 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the date first
above written. In the event that it is impracticable to obtain the signature of any one or more of the Partners to this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding among the other Partners executing the same.

authorized in this Section , and the Partnership and its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such Covered Person s interests/investments in the Partnership and such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold
amounts otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such Partner shall be responsible, up to
the amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining capital commitment, for such Partner s pro rata share of the Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the General Partner. The
Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect to
indemnification pursuant to this Section. The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify pursuant to this Section 3.6. 
 26 

(ii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater
certainty, it is understood and/or agreed that the Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under
applicable law governing SP RE VI and/or a particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced
in the following order of priority: first out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP RE VI, second by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment is
indirectly held, and third by SP RE VI (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). 

(B) 
 The Partnership s obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Covered Person shall be
reduced by any amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP RE VI and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the
Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP RE VI and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it is agreed
among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP RE VI and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to structure any
such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or advisable to give
effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing. Section 3.7. Representations of Limited Partners . 
 (a) Each Limited Partner by execution of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the terms and conditions hereof as provided herein
or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Limited Partner is acquiring each of such Limited Partner s Interests for such Limited
Partner s own account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Limited Partner hereunder; provided ,
that a Partner may choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Limited Partner represents and warrants that such Limited Partner understands that the Interests have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore such Interests may not be resold without registration under such Act or exemption from such registration, and that accordingly such Limited Partner must bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner represents 
 27 

that such Limited Partner has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that such Limited Partner is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the
Partnership, and that such Limited Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner represents that such Limited Partner s overall commitment to the Partnership and other investments which are not readily
marketable is not disproportionate to the Limited Partner s net worth and the Limited Partner has no need for liquidity in the Limited Partner s investment in Interests. Each Limited Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of the
Limited Partner, the Limited Partner has been furnished any materials that such Limited Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of
representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information relating thereto. Each Limited Partner represents that
the Limited Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Limited Partner with the Limited Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis
believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Limited Partner. (b) Each Partner agrees that the
representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be true and correct as of any date that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or
otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that such capital contribution shall serve as confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees
that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof. Section 3.8. Tax Representation . Each Limited Partner certifies that
(A) if the Limited Partner is a United States person (as defined in the Code) (x) (i) the Limited Partner s name, social security number (or, if applicable, employer identification number) and address provided to the Partnership and
its Affiliates pursuant to an IRS Form W-9, Payer s Request for Taxpayer Identification Number Certification W-9 or otherwise are correct and
(ii) the Limited Partner will complete and return a W-9, and (y) (i) the Limited Partner is a United States person (as defined in the Code) and (ii) the Limited Partner will notify the
Partnership within 60 days of a change to foreign (non-United States) status or (B) if the Limited Partner is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) (x) (i) the information on the
completed IRS Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding W-8BEN or other applicable form,
including but not limited to IRS Form W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Partnership, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding W-8IMY ), or otherwise is correct and (ii) the Limited Partner will complete and return the applicable IRS form, including but not limited to a
 W-8BEN or W-8IMY, and (y) (i) the Limited Partner is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) and (ii) the Limited Partner will notify the
Partnership within 60 days of any change of such status. The Limited Partner agrees to properly execute and provide to the Partnership in a timely manner any tax documentation that may be reasonably required by the Partnership or the General
Partner.

ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . (a) Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the
Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required
to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP RE VI in respect of the GP-Related SP RE VI Interest with respect to any GP-Related SP
RE VI Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any; provided, that additional
 GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each Partner s Carried Interest
Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business operations (as distinct from
financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section s 4.1(d) and 5.8(d)) shall be determined by the General Partner. Limited Partners shall not be required to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an increase in such Limited Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner and any Limited Partner may agree from time to time that such Limited Partner shall
make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided further, that each Investor Limited Partner shall maintain its GP-Related Capital
Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE VI Interest. (b) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to
(i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the
amount of any GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but
excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms
determined by the General Partner. (c) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a Partner shall be
credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (d) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which certain amounts of distributions relating
to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a Holdback ). 
 29 

(i) The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage
of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner) and each Partner Category (such withheld percentage constituting a General Partner s and such Partner
Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than any General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than
any General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for any General Partner (including, without limitation,
the General Partner) shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). 
 (ii) The Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his Partner
Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased
to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such reduction. (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any individual
Partner as compared to the other Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner
concurrently increases the Existing Partners Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both
Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to 24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback
Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any
Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 ,
respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 (iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Partnership may increase or decrease the Holdback
Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners and the General Partner (a Holdback Vote provided , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a Subject Partner s
Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such
Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote 
 30 

(requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under
this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for such Subject Partner s Partner Category;
 provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is
reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the
 GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts
that may become due. 

(B) 
 A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners and the General Partner
shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 

(C) 
 If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such
Subject Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually
satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided further ,
that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that
submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected out-of-pocket 
expenses relating thereto and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the
Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account to be controlled by Simpson Thacher Bartlett LLP, as escrow agent (or such other comparable law firm as the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall agree). The arbitrator shall direct
the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account.
If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses of 
 31 

such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the
 victorious party shall be the Partnership, if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the
Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 

(D) 
 In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote
under this clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as
expressly provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) (A) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the
 Excess Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his Holdback obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he was a Partner), to the extent his Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust Amounts (but
not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or otherwise making available
to the Partnership, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing
Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of
the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that in the case of entities listed in the books and records of the Partnership, in which Partners/members are permitted to pledge their interests therein to finance
all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or
Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the Partnership a second priority security interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to
the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or (y) if the 
 32 

General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the books and records of the Partnership to remit
any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. 

(B) 
 If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral
Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. 

(C) 
 Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm
Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral
are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30
days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his Excess Holdback requirement. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under this
clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this clause (C); provided further , that for purposes of
applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as
 defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution
Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 33 

(vi) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the
release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for
the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C
from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P and P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or
(y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below
the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient
L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP RE VI, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank
whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may
(as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under the Clawback
Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his L/C upon (1) the termination of the Trust
Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder), or
(3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to
the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner
may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership; provided, that in no way shall the
general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 34 

(vii) (A) Any in-kind 
distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any
 in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. 

(B) 
 In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge with respect to any
 in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the books and records of the Partnership; provided , that the initial contribution of such Special Firm
Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback Amount for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm
Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback Amount specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount
from the Trust Account. (viii) (A) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any
portion of his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain
a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner
(as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment
of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) )to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 

(B) 
 If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special
Firm Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with
an Excess Holdback) is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the
Trust Account)), then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral
 
 35 

that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to
fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner
shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to his Holdback in cash or an L/C. 

(C) 
 Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any adjustment in the Applicable
Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the books and records of the Partnership), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral valued at less than such Partner s Holdback (excluding
any Excess Holdback) as provided in the books and records of the Partnership, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner
and, within 10 business days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such deficiency. If any such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to such default; provided
further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 

(D) 
 Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may revoke the ability
of such Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to the
Withdrawn Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any
Excess Holdback). 
 36 

(E) 
 Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner from using any amount
of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, or
(iii) as determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V 
 PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES 
 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . 
 (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in Section 5.4. (b)
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any activity of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE VI Interest for any accounting period means
(i) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items that are deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are
allocable to such activity (determined as provided below). GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
any GP-Related Investment for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of means (i) the gross amount of
dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are
allocable to such GP-Related Investment (determined as provided below). 
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment
for the accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment is sold or otherwise disposed of means (i) the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period
less (ii) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP- Related Investment.

GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined in accordance with
the accounting method used by the Partnership for Federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from Federal income taxation and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value on the books of the Partnership that differs from its adjusted tax basis for Federal income tax
purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset on the books of the Partnership pursuant to
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any expenditures of the Partnership not deductible in
computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this definition shall be treated as deductible items;
(v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in such GP-Related Investment
awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and
(vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership and Affiliates of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partnership and such Affiliates, among various Partnership

by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid, unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened
litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items, shall be made in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP provided , that the General Partner shall
not be required to make any such adjustment. (c) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal Year except that, at the option of the General
Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event
referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to the Partners 
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments
to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting
period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. 
 38 

(d) In establishing GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it deems appropriate. 
 (e) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under this Agreement shall be
made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all Withdrawn Partners, their
successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any successor thereto. 
 Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner on the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be appropriate, one or
more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE VI
Interest and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ). 
 (b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one or more of the Partners with respect
to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners 
 GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited
with the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE VI Interest during such
accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each
Partner shall be debited with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any property
distributed to such Partner during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP- Related Partner Interest and (y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated
to such Partner for such accounting period. Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages . (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing
percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting
period pursuant to Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , however , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership
during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (d) below and (ii) GP-Related Net
 
 39 

Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment established in accordance with paragraph (d) below. The General Partner may establish different GP- Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of
any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General
Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. 
 (b) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of the GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages of any category for any annual accounting period at the time specified in Section 5.3(a) for the annual fixing of GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided , that any
 GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner within 90
days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP- Related
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) . 
 (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related Investment of all the Partners
participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than
amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners, second, to Partners that received Non-Carried 
Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP- Related Net Income is
being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts
representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. 
 40 

(b) GP-Related Net Loss of the Partnership shall be
allocated as follows: (i) GP- Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP RE VI and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on capital contributions
made by the Partnership to SP RE VI with respect to the GP-Related SP RE VI Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s
 Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP RE VI and
 (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP RE VI and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s
(including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above, GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest
allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as
the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in
accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. 
 (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period
unrelated to SP RE VI, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such
accounting period. (e) The General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner
admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net
Income (Loss). Section 5.5. Liability of General Partners . General Partners shall have unlimited liability for the
satisfaction and discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. Section 5.6. Liability of Limited
Partners . Each Limited Partner and former Limited Partner shall be liable for the satisfaction and discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership allocable to him pursuant to Section 5.4 or 7.3, but only to the extent
required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, in no event shall any Limited Partner or former Limited Partner be obligated to make any additional capital contribution to the Partnership in excess of his
aggregate GP-Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions pursuant to Section s 4.1 and 7.1, or have any liability in excess of such aggregate GP- Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions for the satisfaction and discharge of the losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. In no way does any of the
foregoing limit any Partner s obligations under Section 4.1(d), 5.8(d) or 7.4(g) or otherwise to make capital contributions as provided hereunder. 
 41 

Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time
establish such repurchase rights and/or other requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP RE VI Investments as
the General Partner may determine. The General Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until
any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is
Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from time to time, and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) (i) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or
other property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section s 4.1(d) and 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing Percentages.
 (ii) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP RE VI of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP- Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP- Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RE VI) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RE VI) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such
 GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related 
 42 

Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP- Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category.
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total Federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum Federal, New York State and New York City income and other tax rates, (ii) taking into account the deductibility of State and local income and other taxes for Federal income tax purposes and
(iii) taking into account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
sentence, the General Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by the Partnership Act. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof
(together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the
applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase
Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP- Related Investment that remains
Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be
allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment,
or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of
unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new
Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Limited Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to
its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. 
 43 

(d) (i) (A) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback
Provisions to contribute to SP RE VI a Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP RE VI Interest (the amount of any such obligation
of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the Partnership shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such
obligations of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the Partnership, such an amount of prior distributions by the
Partnership (and the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount
payable by the Partnership, in the case of Clawback Amounts, and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP RE VI Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback Amount,
(b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP RE VI Investments other
than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP RE VI Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP RE VI Investment, all GP-Related SP RE VI Investments. Each Partner
and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call, such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if
applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs 
obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount and/or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably
practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the Partnership shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the Partnership may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the Partnership s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the
Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account used to pay any part of any
 GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. Solely to the extent required by the SP RE VI Agreements, each member of the General
Partner shall have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) solely with respect to such
member s pro 
 44 

rata share of any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in section 11.3(b) of the SP RE VI Partnership Agreement) and solely to the extent the Partnership has insufficient
funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under section 11.3 of the SP RE VI Partnership Agreement and/or the corresponding provisions under any other SP RE VI Agreement. 

(B) 
 To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the Partnership s call for GP- Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the
Holdback obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment
hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP- Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the
Partnership shall require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such
amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP- Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the
Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of
the amount of the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 45 

(B) 
 Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either
(1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies
(at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP- Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the Partnership a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the
Partnership may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the Partnership as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The Partnership shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 

(C) 
 Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a
 GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall
first seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related 
Deficiency Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution. 
 46 

(iii) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make
contributions to the Partnership under this Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners
acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by
allocating writedowns and losses (to be determined by the General Partner in accordance with GAAP and as reported by SP RE VI) on GP- Related SP RE VI Investments that have been the subject of a writedown
and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried
Interest distributions from other GP-Related SP RE VI Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in
this Section 5.8(e). (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a GP-Related SP RE VI Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP RE VI Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall calculate amounts
distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: 

(A) 
 determine each Partner s share of each such Loss Investment based on his Carried Interest Sharing
Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution to all Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RE VI)
from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 

(B) 
 determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to
the Subject Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RE VI) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and

(C) 
 subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the Unadjusted Carried
Interest Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 47 

To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this
clause (i) is a negative number, the General Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior
Carried Interest distributions (a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution, and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to
clause (I) are insufficient to satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest
Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Tax Rate
in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess
 Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest
otherwise distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is
determined (as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of
negative Net Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution
shall be allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. 
 A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as
provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. A Partner
may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to
the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner, including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as
provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so
distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner to
date). (ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided
herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 

(A) 
 determine each Partner s share of any Losses in any GP-Related SP
RE VI Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount i.e. , the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP RE VI Investment with respect to which Carried Interest distributions were made), based on
such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP RE VI Investments; 
 48 

(B) 
 determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s
Carried Interest Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and 

(C) 
 subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from the amount determined in clause (A) above
with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of
each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP RE VI Agreements. Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The
Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner
from time to time. Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For Federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. 
 49 

(b) For Federal, State and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss,
deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each fiscal year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are allocated among the Partners pursuant to clause (a) above,
provided the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations have substantial economic effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the
meaning of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as General Partners or Limited Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section s 3.7 and 3.8. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner all terms of such additional Partner s participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each
additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Limited Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Limited Partner shall
not have such voting rights (any such Limited Partner being called a Nonvoting Limited Partner ). Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and
conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to
finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited
Partner to such extent. Any Additional Partner may have a GP-Related Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. 
 (b) The GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of
the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General
Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all
other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner. 
 50 

(c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his pro rata
share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times and
in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section s 4.1 and 7.1. (d) The admission of an
additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of, or counter-signature page with respect to, this Agreement by such additional Partner, or (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the
General Partner and the additional Partner, as determined by the General Partner, or (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a substitute or additional Limited Partner
and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such writing being accepted by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing
evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the Trust Agreement. Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner. The General Partner
generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner
to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided , that a Partner may not voluntarily Withdraw without the consent of the General Partner if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business; provided
further that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital
Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any
withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. 
 (c) Upon the Total Disability of a Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided, however, that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to
such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP- Related Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether any Partner
has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a
qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 51 

(d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the
Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw
with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or
after the date of such notice. If the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s
Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. 
 (e) The Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue
the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the
fullest extent provided by law. Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not
Transferable . (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without the prior written consent of the General Partner; provided , that, subject to the Partnership Act, this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by operation of law,
transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further , that, subject to the prior written consent of the General
Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust, limited
partnership or limited liability company with respect to which such Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a
Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the interest transferred
(including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the
Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(a), no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or otherwise) of the
whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a General Partner or Limited Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent
may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire partnership interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a partner of the
Partnership. 
 52 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all Federal, State and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. General Partner Withdrawal; Transfer of General Partner s Interest . 
 (a) The General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its right to manage the affairs of
the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, with the prior written approval of a Majority In Interest of the Partners admit another person as an additional or substitute General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself
as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided , however , that the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the
Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise) and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part
of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under
this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership
and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security
interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as contemplated by clause (a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner
is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a General Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining General Partners and any one or more of such remaining General Partners continue the business
of the Partnership (any and all such remaining General Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). If upon the Withdrawal of a General Partner there shall be no
remaining General Partner, the Partnership nonetheless shall not be dissolved and shall not be required to be wound up if, within 90 days after the occurrence of such event of Withdrawal, all remaining Limited Partners (excluding Withdrawn Partners)
agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more General Partners. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest . (a) The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related 
Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term
 Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Limited Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for
all purposes hereof. 
 53 

(b) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his Withdrawal Date; provided , that if a
Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month in which his Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval,
if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on
capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained a Partner of the Partnership during such period. 
 (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner with respect to such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall, promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). (e) (i) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss) or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the 
 54 

Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital
Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment) and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage
interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph (f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with
paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(p) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the
amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided, that if the Withdrawn Partner was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Limited
Partner) on his Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative balance in the
 GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Limited Partner), upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in
accordance with their respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the General Partner as of such
Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or the
anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to
such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described
below, to receive a Nonvoting Limited Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than
all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. The election referred to above shall
be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to
this Section 6.5. (f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s percentage
interest means his GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn Partner shall retain his
percentage interest in such GP- Related Investment and shall retain his GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn Partner shall become and remain a Limited Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so
designates, such Limited Partner shall be a Nonvoting Limited Partner). The GP-Related Partner Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole
discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that
the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to this sentence. 
 55 

(g) The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a
Withdrawn Partner pursuant to paragraph (e) above, to have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as
determined by the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are
distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. 
 (h) [Intentionally omitted]. 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of
such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind distributions to be made
to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in respect of the settlement
of his GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above or adjustments to
reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by the Withdrawn
Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of payment and subject
to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or distribution; provided 
that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question and
(y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. 
 (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should prove,
in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his estate such
deficiency, as the case may be. 
 56 

(k) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after the
Settlement Date (e.g., outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date or shall
be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to the date
of payment at a floating rate equal to the lesser of (x) the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as its prime rate or (y) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. The
 due date of amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in
respect of GP-Related Investments for which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph (f) above shall be 120 days after realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such amounts are determined to be payable. 
 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, encumbrance or other transfer by such Withdrawn
Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such Withdrawn Partner s right
to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his GP-Related Partner Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(r) of this
Section 6.5; provided, however, that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any GP-Related Investment in
which he has an interest as of his Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such
 GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn Partner his allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause
(x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such
 GP-Related Investment as of his Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply the provisions of paragraph (f) above, provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any
 GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 57 

(ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or
on or after the applicable date of payment or distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may
be conditioned on the compliance by such Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and
Affiliates for a period not exceeding two years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this
paragraph (o) may elect to forfeit the principal amount payable in the final installment of his subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such
restrictions. (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the
General Partner) a discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Limited Partner relating to
another Limited Partner, and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner pursuant to Section 6.3, if such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership. 
 (p) (i) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his estate. 
 (ii) The Partnership may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to
Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the Partnership will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If
the Withdrawn Partner (or his estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the Partnership will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (q) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful
agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner,
any and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5,
including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 58 

Section 6.6. Termination of the Partnership . The General Partner may dissolve
the Partnership at any time on not less than 60 days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section s, 6.5, which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the capital account
balances of the Partners. Section 6.7. Certain Tax Matters . i. All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the
Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for Federal, State and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except
as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable law. To the extent U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Subchapter K of the Code (including under Section s 704(b) and (c) of the Code) or other applicable
law require allocations for tax purposes that differ from the foregoing allocations, the General Partner may determine the manner in which such tax allocations shall be made so as to comply more fully with such Treasury Regulations or other
applicable law and, at the same time, preserve the economic relationships among the Partners as set forth in this Agreement. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in
accordance with the principles of Regulations Section s 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Regulations Section s 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). 
In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Regulations Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
 (a) The General Partner shall cause to be prepared all Federal, State and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such
returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item or any other method or procedure related to the

ARTICLE VII 
 CAPITAL COMMITMENT INTERESTS; CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; 
 ALLOCATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS 
 Section 7.1. Capital Commitment Interests, etc. 
 (a) (i) This Article VII and Article VIII hereof set forth certain terms and conditions with respect to the Capital Commitment Partner
Interests and the Capital Commitment SP RE VI Interest and matters related to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment SP RE VI Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VII or in Article VIII, the
terms and provisions of this Article VII and Article VIII shall not apply to the GP-Related Partner Interests or the GP-Related SP RE VI Interest. 
 (ii) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related
Capital Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s direct or indirect capital contributions to SP RE VI, in respect of the Capital Commitment SP RE VI Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP RE VI Commitment,
if any. No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in an amount in excess of such Partner s Capital Commitment- Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if
any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each Capital Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing
Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the Partnership s portion of the Capital Commitment SP RE VI Commitment, if any, or (ii) the
making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any
Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms upon which the General Partner and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The
acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such
appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. (b) The General Partner or one of its
Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing Party may in its sole discretion advance to any Limited Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners
that are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) all or any portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions due to the Partnership from such Limited Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment
Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Limited Partner shall pay to the Advancing Party interest on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm Advance until the repayment thereof by such Limited Partner. Each Firm Advance shall
be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such
recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Limited Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of
the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Limited Partner of such rate upon such Limited Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum
interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Limited Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including
 
 61 

interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances;
 provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Limited Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed the
maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner on the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his Capital
Commitment Partner Interest, as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to any
other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be
allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or 7.7 shall be
specially allocated to the electing Limited Partner. 
 62 

Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Limited Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his Capital Commitment Investments,
distributions to such Limited Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including without limitation Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment
Interests) during a fiscal year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such fiscal year (or on such earlier date as related distributions are made in the sole
discretion of the General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Limited Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership (or in each case on
such earlier date as selected by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): 
 (i) First, to the payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise)
of such Limited Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all interest payments due, the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes upon which
interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Limited Partner of an amount equal to the Federal, State and local income taxes on income
of the Partnership allocated to such Limited Partner for such year in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to
the limitation that the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an individual
subject to the then-prevailing maximum Federal, New York State and New York City tax rates (taking into account the extent to which such taxable income allocated by the Partnership was composed of long-term capital gains and the deductibility of
State and local income taxes for Federal income tax purposes)); provided, that additional amounts shall be paid to the Limited Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the
Limited Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BCE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further, that amounts paid pursuant to the
provisions in such other BCE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Limited Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BCE Agreements that are comparable to this clause
(ii); (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital
Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year or (B) any BCE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; 
 63 

(iv) Fourth, to the return to such Limited Partner of (A) all Capital
Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any
Blackstone Collateral Entity (other than the Partnership) in respect of interests therein relating to BCE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year (including all principal paid on the
related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other Sources (other than amounts of CC Carried Interest); 
 (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal (including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of
such Limited Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or
Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses
(i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Limited Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor
Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; and 
 (vii) Seventh, to such Limited Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after making the
distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other BCE Investment, as applicable, the payments in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BCE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Limited Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone, distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses
(i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the General Partner or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Limited Partner, until all such Limited Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining
thereafter distributed to such Limited Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the
discretion of the General Partner. At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Limited Partner in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal payable
on his Investor Notes for the full period in respect of which the distribution is made. A distribution of Capital Commitment Net Income to the General Partner shall be made contemporaneously with each distribution of Capital Commitment Net Income to
or for the accounts of the Limited Partners. 
 64 

(b) [Intentionally omitted] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Limited Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 7.4. (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a
Capital Commitment Investment is being considered by the Partnership or SP RE VI (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to
such Capital Commitment Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment
shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
Class A Interests. (g) (i) If the Partnership) is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP RE VI all or a
portion of a Giveback Amount with respect to the Capital Commitment SP RE VI Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the Partnership shall call for
such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the 
 65 

Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the Partnership, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP RE VI Interest (the
 Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP RE VI Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback
Amount, or (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP RE VI Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation. Each
Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the Partnership may, in the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no
obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or
any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the Partnership shall require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of
their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment
Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a
result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner in respect of such default.
Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors
considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership
expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting
Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting
Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the Partnership a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive
payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the Partnership may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Partner hereby appoints the Partnership as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of
the 
 66 

Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The Partnership shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 

(B) 
 Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be
a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (iii) A Partner s obligation to
make contributions to the Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5.
 Valuations . Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any
Affiliate of the Partnership that is a general partner of SP RE VI) in valuing investments of SP RE VI or, in the case of investments not held by SP RE VI, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso
of the immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above;
provided, that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further, that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors
relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of
control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further, that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any
Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member of a General Partner. Section 7.6.
 Disposition Election . (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose
of a Capital Commitment Investment, the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment
Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s
pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained
Portion in the Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account
shall not be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 67 

(b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating
thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special
Distribution Election . (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon
receipt of a written request from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment
Investment) (a Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to
or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. ARTICLE VIII 
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Limited Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as not subject to repurchase for
purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note
to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest
which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Limited Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided , that in the event that a Limited Partner prepays all or
any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Limited Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone, the Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further , that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be
determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Limited Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Limited Partner shall apply pro rata against
all of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes; provided , that such Limited Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BCE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Collateral
Entities specified by such Limited Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interests. 
 68 

(b) Upon a Limited Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such Limited Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Limited Partner (the Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner
shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s) within 45 days of such Limited Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days
notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership, subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by the
Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest will be an amount equal to (i) the
outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be made in cash) and (ii) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Limited Partner on the portion of the principal amount of the Investor Note relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent plus (y) all Capital Commitment Net
Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment
Interest; provided , that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his position as an officer for Cause, the amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General Partner s sole
discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income received by such holders
on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount resulting from an exchange is negative, it shall be payable to the holders
of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the
 Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests or, if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided , that the General Partner and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing
to a Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, his related Investor Note shall be payable in full. If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercise the right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the
Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his individual capacity, shall be payable in
accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his option, and the 
 69 

General Partner shall apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a
Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. 
 (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Limited Partner, such Limited Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with
respect to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Limited Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right,
as against the Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Limited Partner s Capital
Commitment Partner Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII, subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)) to the
extent, at the time, in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Limited Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such
Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor
any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and
allocations hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. (d) If a Limited Partner dies or suffers a
Total Disability, all Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s
death or Total Disability) as provided in Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to the estate or personal representative in cash), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests
shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Limited Partner, if the estate or personal representative of such Limited Partner so requests in writing within 180 days of
the Limited Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership or
its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non- Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Limited Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then
current fiscal year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. Each Limited Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his will to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the
sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate or personal representative of such Limited Partner within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s death or Total
Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate or personal representative in exchange for such Non- Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in
Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non- Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier
period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. 
 70 

(e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Limited Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his ceasing to be an employee or officer of the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its
sole discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Limited Partner or another Affiliate of the General Partner) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph
(d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the Partnership or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 (f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as
described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the Partnership s designee(s), Blackstone may loan all or a
portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc.
or any of its Affiliates). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such
repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest
relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment
Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or
(ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Limited Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Limited Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a
nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as such Limited Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not so limited, the Partnership may
require an assumption by the Limited Partners of such indebtedness on the 
 71 

terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Limited Partners; provided , that a Limited Partner shall not, except as set forth in his
Investor Note, be obligated to accept any personally recourse obligation unless his prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such
Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except
as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion his aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts
bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. 
 (g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for
Cause, then his Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1; provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct member of a General Partner, the General
Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof; (ii) allow the Withdrawn
Partner to retain such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital
Commitment Investment shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital
Commitment Value thereof; or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. 
 (h) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his estate. 
 72 

(i) The Partnership may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals
to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the Partnership will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to
engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the Partnership will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably appoints each General Partner as such Limited Partner s true and lawful agent, representative
and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Limited Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Limited Partner, any
and all agreements, instruments, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without limitation,
the performance of any obligation of such Limited Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Limited Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Limited Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Limited Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Without the prior written consent of
the General Partner, no Limited Partner or former Limited Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided, that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn Partner s or deceased or Totally Disabled
Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Limited Partner to another Limited Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason
therefor, and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers, for estate planning purposes, of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an
Estate Planning Vehicle. Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such
Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate
Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Limited Partner of the Partnership, or acquire
such Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Limited Partner shall not cease to be a limited partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of, or the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire limited partner interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no Transfer of a Capital Commitment
Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all Federal, State and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws. 
 73 

ARTICLE IX 
 DISSOLUTION Section 9.1.
 Dissolution . (a) The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (i) pursuant to Section 6.6; 
 (ii) upon the expiration of the Term; or 
 (iii) upon the occurrence of a Disabling Event with respect to the last remaining General Partner, provided that the
Partnership shall not be dissolved if, within 90 days after the Disabling Event, Limited Partners entitled to vote thereon as provided herein who, as of the last day of the most recent accounting period ending on or prior to the date of the
Disabling Event, have aggregate GP-Related Capital Account balances representing at least a majority in amount of the total GP-Related Capital Account balances of all
the persons who are Limited Partners entitled to vote thereon as provided herein agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of the Disabling Event, of another General Partner. 
 (b) When the Partnership is dissolved, the business and property of the Partnership shall be wound up and liquidated by the General Partner
or, in the event of the unavailability of the General Partner, such Limited Partner or other liquidating trustee as shall be named by the Designated Limited Partner (the General Partner, such Limited Partner or other liquidating trustee, as the case
may be, being hereinafter referred to as the Liquidator ). Section 9.2. Final Distribution . Within 120
calendar days after the effective date of dissolution of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership shall be distributed in the following manner and order: 
 (i) to the payment of the expenses of the winding-up, liquidation and dissolution of
the Partnership; (ii) to pay all creditors of the Partnership, other than Partners, either by the payment thereof or the
making of reasonable provision therefor; (iii) to establish reserves, in amounts established by the General Partner or the
Liquidator, to meet other liabilities of the Partnership; and (iv) to pay, in accordance with the terms agreed among them
and otherwise on a pro rata basis, all creditors of the Partnership that are Partners, either by the payment thereof or the making of reasonable provision therefor. 
 74 

(b) The remaining assets of the Partnership shall be applied and distributed among the
Partners as follows: (i) With respect to each Partner s GP-Related Partner
Interest, the remaining assets of the Partnership shall be applied and distributed to such Partner in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the capital accounts of the Partners and
distributions in accordance with the capital account balances of the Partners; and for purposes of the application of this Section 9.2 (b)(i), determining GP-Related Capital Accounts on liquidation, all
unrealized gains, losses and accrued income and deductions of the Partnership shall be treated as realized and recognized immediately before the date of distribution; and 
 (ii) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to such Partner in cash
or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment Investment shall not be
equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment; and the remaining assets
of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for each Capital Commitment
Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner
Interests .If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests which, in the judgment of the Liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in
kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in each such Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners
participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his pro rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or
other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the Liquidator shall determine. (a) If
there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of
the Liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such
Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the Liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital
Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the Liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on account of such transaction or claim. 
 75 

(b) Upon determination by the Liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion
of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the Liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in clause (ii) of Section 9.2(b)
such sums or such Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . (a) Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably,
including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including
the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision) shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York , NY in accordance with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator
shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration proceedings. 
 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may cause the Partnership to bring, on behalf of the
General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an
arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this Section 10.1 to any such action or proceeding,
(ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably appoints the General
Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who shall promptly advise such Partner of any such service of process, shall be
deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Partner in any such action or proceeding. (c) (i) EACH PARTNER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO
AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial
relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the forum(s) designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another.
 
 76 

(i) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, any objection which they now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such
parties agree not to plead or claim the same. (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1
shall be construed to the maximum extent possible to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If,
nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware
Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within
the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Firm Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ),
a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and that the ownership of,
and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors, successors or assigns) has
licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a
 non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the
permission of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and
its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such termination,
the Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service mark or
otherwise. Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a vote of Partners at a meeting may
be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. 
 77 

Section 10.4. Letter Agreements; Schedules . The General Partner may, or may
cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages or any other matter. The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners Schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages
and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such Schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any
purpose whatsoever; provided that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement. Section 10.5. Governing
Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflict of laws. In particular, the Partnership has been formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the
rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum extent
permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third
Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor
to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have
any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Articles VI and VIII. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any
transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based on the
standards set forth in Section s 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and 7.4(g)(ii)(A), to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or any Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and
their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the SP RE VI Agreements, the limited partners in SP RE VI shall be third-party beneficiaries of the
provisions of Section s 5.8(d)(i)(A) and 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in section 11.3 (b) of the SP RE VI Partnership Agreement).
 Section 10.7. Partner s Will . Each Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall include in his or her will
a provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligation relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner, and each such Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in
writing, that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Limited Partner s or Withdrawn
 
 78 

Partner s Interest is transferred shall include a provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that
such provision or its substantial equivalent remains in such trust. In the event any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.7 after the Partnership has notified such Limited Partner or
Withdrawn Partner of his or her failure to so comply and such failure to so comply is not cured within 30 days of such notice, the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner until the time at
which such party complies with the requirements of this Section 10.7. Section 10.8. Confidentiality . By executing this
Agreement, each Partner expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than
the Partnership, another Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business, financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally
known to the public or the securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided, however, that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is
required by law, rule, regulation or custom to disclose. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any
employee, representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose,
(1) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding (a) the Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners;
(2) any performance information relating to any of the Partners or their investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax
treatment or tax structure information. Section 10.9. Notices . Whenever notice is required or permitted by this Agreement to
be given, such notice shall be in writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be given by hand delivery (including any courier service) or telecopy to any Partner at its address or telecopy number shown in the books and records of the
Partnership or, if given to the General Partner or the Partnership, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch, and (ii) if given by
hand delivery, when delivered to the address of such Partner or the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. 
 Section 10.10. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and
all of which together shall constitute a single instrument. Section 10.11. Power of Attorney . Each Partner hereby irrevocably
appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead,
to make, execute, sign and file all instruments, documents and certificates which, from time to time, may be required to set forth any amendment to this Agreement or may be required by this Agreement or by the laws of the United
 
 79 

States of America, the State of Delaware or any other state in which the Partnership shall determine to do business, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, to execute, implement and
continue the valid and subsisting existence of the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the subsequent Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner
for any reason and shall not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity of such Partner. Section 10.12. Cumulative
Remedies . Rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and do not preclude use of other rights and remedies available under applicable law. 
 Section 10.13. Legal Fees . Except as more specifically provided herein, in the event of a legal dispute (including litigation,
arbitration or mediation) between any Partner or Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership, arising in connection with any party seeking to enforce Section 4.1(d) or any other provision of this Agreement relating to the Holdback, the Clawback
Amount, the GP-Related Giveback Amount, the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount or the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount,
the losing party to such dispute shall promptly reimburse the victorious party for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute (such determination to be made by the relevant adjudicator).
Any amounts due under this Section 10.13 shall be paid within 30 days of the date upon which such amounts are due to be paid and such amounts remaining unpaid after such date shall accrue interest at the Default Interest Rate. 
 Section 10.14. Entire Agreement . This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect
of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein. Subject to Section 10.4, this Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. 
 80 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the date first
above written. In the event that it is impracticable to obtain the signature of any one or more of the Partners to this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding among the other Partners executing the same.

such Losses. To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person (including, without limitation, the General Partner) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval
of the General Partner, from time to time, be advanced by 
 24 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

the Partnership prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to
repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 3.5(b), and the Partnership and its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of
offset against such Covered Person s interests/investments in the Partnership and such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner
institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such Partner shall be responsible, up to the amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining capital commitments, for such Partner s
 pro rata share of the Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the General Partner. The Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages
or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect to indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate
agreements with any Covered Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). 
 (ii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty, it is understood and/or agreed that the
Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable law governing SP RE VII and/or a
particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the following order of priority:
 first , out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP RE VII; second , by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment is indirectly held;
and third , by SP RE VII (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). (B) The Partnership s
obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP RE VII and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by
virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP RE VII and/or the applicable portfolio entity
(including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it is agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP RE VII and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or
payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates,
which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing.

as provided herein or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Partner is acquiring each of such Partner s Interests for such

Partner may choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (pursuant to Section 6.3(a) and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents and warrants that such Partner

has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information
relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning
an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner. 
 (b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be
true and correct as of any date that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that
such capital contribution shall serve as confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership and the General Partner may release confidential information or other information about the Limited Partner or Special Partner or related to such Limited Partner or Special Partner s
investment in the Partnership if the Partnership or the General Partner, in its or their sole discretion, determines that such disclosure is required by applicable law or regulation or in order to comply for an exception from, or reduced tax rate
of, tax or other tax benefit. Any such disclosure shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed on any such person by law or otherwise, and a Limited Partner or Special Partner shall have no claim
against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of their Affiliates for any form of damages or liability as a result of actions taken by the foregoing in order to comply with any disclosure obligations that the foregoing reasonably believe are

ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . (a) Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the
Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required
to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP RE VII in respect of the GP-Related SP RE VII Interest with respect to any GP-Related SP
RE VII Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any, or otherwise; provided, that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing
Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business operations (as distinct from
financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General Partner. Special Partners shall not be required to make
additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an increase in such
Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner and any Special Partner may agree from time to time that
such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided, further, that each Investor Special Partner shall maintain its
 GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total
capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP RE VII Interest. (b) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to
Section 5.10. (c) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner
(including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any
 GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any
Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by
the General Partner. (d) (i) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which
certain amounts of the distributions relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a
 Holdback ). The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld
percentage constituting the General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than the
General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than the General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback
Percentage for the General Partner and/or Holdings shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). 
 28 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(ii) The Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner
as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the
Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall
apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. (iii) The Holdback
Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners 
Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the
General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to 24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies
equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner
from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners,
Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 (iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General Partner may increase or decrease the
Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback Vote provided , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject
Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the
prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such
Partner s 
 29 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or assigns (including such
Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of
satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. (B) A
Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast
by any such Partner in person or by proxy. (C) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided, that if the Partnership and the Subject
Partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such
candidates; provided further, that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator.
Each Subject Partner that submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected
 out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator,
pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with
such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is
insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party
shall be the Partnership if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner
Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (D) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect 
 30 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such
reduced Holdback Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) (A) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the
 Excess Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess
Holdback ), and such Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may
obtain the release of the Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback
obligation, by pledging, granting a security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess
Holdback obligation. Any Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the
General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s
books and records in which Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the
extent a first priority security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a second priority security
interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or
(y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in
the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from
a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking
such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. (B)
If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback
requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including 
 31 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm
Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization,
if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this
clause (C); provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon
which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership to
distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term
deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by
S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall
supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a
date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP RE VII, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal
 
 32 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The
Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under
the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the
termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the
extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback
obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category
of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 (vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried
Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any
time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. (B) In lieu of the
foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s
books and records; provided, that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections
4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the
related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount from the Trust Account. (viii) (A) Any Limited Partner or
Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in
cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that
 
 33 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging or otherwise granting a security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis
all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to
satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority
security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (B) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback)
is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust Account)), then
up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net
proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes
Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to
his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any
adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such
deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further, that for purposes of applying 
 34 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such

determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such
 GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the

amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to
Partners that received Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the
years such GP-Related Net Income is being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of
 GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the
same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed
if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the
Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP RE VII and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof

(including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above, GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest
allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as

accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. 
 (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period

accounting period.

(e) The General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any
additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of

make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or
Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally Omitted] .

is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis.

 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(ii) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP
RE VII of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the
General Partner each Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s
 GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RE VII) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP RE VII) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such
 GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income, and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof
(together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the
applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have 
 41 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the
Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall
be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests
in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in
such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. (d) (i) (A) If
the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP RE VII a Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the
 GP-Related SP RE VII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related 
Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to
the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried 
Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a
Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with
(a) the GP-Related SP RE VII Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are
insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP RE VII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts
received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP RE VII Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount
pursuant to an applicable SP RE VII Agreement is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP RE VII Investment, all GP-Related SP RE VII Investments. Each Partner and
Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if
applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs 
obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; 
 42 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the
 GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as
reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential
obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account
used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days
after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. 
 (B) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment
hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the SP RE VII Partnership Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall have
the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro
rata share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP RE VII Partnership Agreement. 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the
General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a
 
 43 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a
 GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from
such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date
that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e),
no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net GP Related Recontribution Amount
initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. (B) Thereafter, the General Partner
shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good
faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership
expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such
 GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting
Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest,
effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that,
upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true
and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take
any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest
Rate. 
 44 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(C) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first
seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution.
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute. 
 (iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating Losses (as defined in the SP RE VII
Agreements) on GP-Related SP RE VII Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments
based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related SP RE VII Investments. Consequently and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a
 GP-Related SP RE VII Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP RE VII Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall calculate
amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share of each such
Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution to all
Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RE VII) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 45 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise
distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP RE VII) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest
Distributions and (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the
Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income Tax Rate (as defined in the SP RE VII
Agreements) in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise
distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined
(as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net
Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be
allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. A
Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all
purposes hereof. A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject
to a Holdback, to the extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account
any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 46 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner,
including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such
amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried
Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be
contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses (as defined in the SP RE VII Agreements) in any GP-Related SP RE VII Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP RE VII Investment with respect to which Carried
Interest distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP RE VII Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 
 47 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the
Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP RE VII Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. (b) All items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in
accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are in
accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. (c) For U.S. federal, state
and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are
allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 5.10; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations
have substantial economic effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority to any item of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an adjustment to any Partner s distributive share thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined by the General Partner) in
accordance with the final resolution of such audit adjustment.

 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION

 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms of such additional Partner s
participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution,
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time
unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special Partner ).
Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the
General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or
subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a GP-Related 
Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. (b) The
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other
Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be
allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by
the General Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any further act, vote or consent of any person, to make adjustments to the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to other Partners of the
Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. 
 49 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(c) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his or her pro
rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times
and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. (d) The
admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of this Agreement by such additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional
Partner, as determined by the General Partner and / or (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and
such writing being acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party
to the Trust Agreement that is acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. Section 6.2. Withdrawal of
Partners . (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner,
including if such Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its
business. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion), on not less than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided, that a Partner may
Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest,
and a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest. (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act
with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. (c) Upon the Total
Disability of a Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided, that the General Partner may elect to admit
such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner
Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of
agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 50 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the
Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with
respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after
the date of such notice. If the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital
Commitment Partner Interest, such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. 
 (e) The Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue
the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the
fullest extent provided by law. Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not
Transferable . (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any
portion of such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided, that this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers
by operation of law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further, that, subject to the prior written consent of the
General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning
trust, limited partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will
be a Nonvoting Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to the Partnership
(including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require any Estate Planning Vehicle to
Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or
otherwise) of the whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be
given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a Partner of the Partnership. 
 51 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . 
 (a) Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its
right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute
General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided however, that the General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise)
and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of
liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner
and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as
contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or
more of such remaining Partners continue the business of the Partnership (any and all such remaining Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). Notwithstanding
Section 6.4(c), if upon the Withdrawal of a Partner there shall be no remaining Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be dissolved and shall be wound up unless, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Withdrawal, all remaining Special
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. 
 (c) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or
remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 52 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests . (a) The terms of this
Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner
Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner
Interest is retained as a Special Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date
for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall
be his or her Withdrawal Date; provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month
in which his or her Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained
a Partner of the Partnership during such period. (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). (e) (i) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
 
 53 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i)
below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement
Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment) and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest
as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph (f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined
pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i)
below; provided, that if the Withdrawn Partner was solely a Special Partner on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any
aggregate negative balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Special Partner, upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in
accordance with their respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as
determined by the General Partner as of such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be
ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to
such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described
below, to receive a Nonvoting Special Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than all) illiquid investments of the
Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Investor Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. The election referred to above shall be made within 60 days
after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5.
 (f) For purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest means his or
her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn Partner shall retain his or her percentage
interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn Partner shall become and remain a Special Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so
designates, such Special Partner shall be a Nonvoting Special Partner). The GP-Related Partner Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to 
 54 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the
General Partner in its sole discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other
Partners; provided , that the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to this sentence. 
 (g) The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to paragraph
(e) above, to (i) have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to (ii) distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by the
General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to a
Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. (h) [Intentionally
omitted]. (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the
settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind
distributions to be made to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in
respect of the settlement of his or her GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph
(f) above or adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based
shall be accepted by the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be
subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date
of payment or distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the
Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. 
 (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should prove,
in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or her
estate such deficiency, as the case may be.

Settlement Date e.g. , outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date
or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to

to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such
professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners.

selected by the General Partner as the partnership representative (as defined under the Code) (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless

otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option
(ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the
Partnership) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without
limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive

 (ii) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related
Capital Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to SP RE VII in respect of the Capital Commitment SP RE VII Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP RE VII Commitment, if any

Capital Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each
Capital Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the
Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment, or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or
SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms
upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related
Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 (b) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing Party may in its sole discretion advance to
any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital

Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of 
 60 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.]

shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing
Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such rate upon such Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by
applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole
discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to
such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law. 
 Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the
 
 61 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of

respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special costs relating to
distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 7.7 shall be specially allocated to the electing Partner. (c) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary
for this purpose. Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 (a) Each Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments,

General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected
by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): (i) First, to the
payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise) of such Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all
interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on income of
the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to the limitation that
the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an individual subject to the
then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes (including, without limitation, taxes imposed under Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character of such taxable income allocated by the
Partnership and the limitations on deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax 
 62 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

purposes); provided, that additional amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the
Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further, that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions
in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BE Agreements that are comparable to this clause (ii); 
 (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital Commitment
Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year or (B) any BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; 
 (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in respect of
the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Entity (other than the Partnership) in respect of
interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other
Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal
(including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of
payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital
Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the
Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the
Lender or Guarantor; and (vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income
remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 63 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other
BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest
payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate
thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in
respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or
other distribution remaining thereafter distributed to such Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any
other time at the discretion of the General Partner. At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal
payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period in respect of which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a Capital Commitment Investment
is being considered by the Partnership or SP RE VII (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to such Capital Commitment
Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the 
 64 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be
made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class A
Interests. (g) (i) If the Partnership is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP RE VII a Giveback Amount with
respect to any Capital Commitment SP RE VII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall
call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the
General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP RE VII Interest (the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata 
share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP RE VII Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to
satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP RE VII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation and (c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable SP RE VII Agreement is
unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment SP RE VII Investment, all Capital Commitment SP RE VII Investments. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution
Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital
Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or
any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such
 GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment
Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment
Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution
be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner s in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good
faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of 
 65 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership
against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective
upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a
Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may
sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful
 attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to
accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. (B)
Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. 
 (iii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the
termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5. Valuations . Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of
the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any other Affiliate of the Partnership that is a general partner of SP RE VII) in valuing
investments of SP RE VII or, in the case of investments not held by SP RE VII, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment
Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided, that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier
date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further, that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to
the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent
permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further, that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct
member or partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. 
 66 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such

Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not
be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership.

 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to
or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. ARTICLE VIII 
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as
 Non-Contingent for purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment
Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not 
 67 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest which from time to time
comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided, that in the event that a Partner prepays all or any portion of the principal amount of the
Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, the Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase the
Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further, that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be determined in accordance with the
determination of the purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Partner shall apply pro rata against all of such Partner s Investor Notes; provided,
that such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Entities specified by such Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment
Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 (b) (i) Upon a Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such
Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its
designee(s) within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership (subject to the prior consent of the General
Partner, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by
the Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 (ii) The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be an amount equal to (A) the
outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to
(x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to be repurchased, plus (y) all Capital
Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital
Commitment Interest; provided, that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General Partner s
sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income received by such
holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative, it 
 68 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

shall be payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the
 Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or (B) if the Partnership or its
designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided, that the Partnership and its
Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the
Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. 
 (iii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an officer or employee, all Investor Notes shall become fully recourse to the
Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). 
 (iv) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner
in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the Partnership shall apply such prepayments
against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. (v) To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a
Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. 
 (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and
the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant
to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time, in the manner and
in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise
and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until distribution of any such
 
 69 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

Partner s interest in the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof
shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations
hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. (d) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability,
all Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total
Disability) (and the purchase price for such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal
representative or other Successor in Interest, in cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total
Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in
Interest of such Partner, so requests in writing within 180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests
shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership or its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as
of the last day of the Partnership s then current Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate
provisions in his or her will to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such
Partner, within 30 days of the first date on which the General Partner knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate, personal
representative or other Successor in Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a
Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an
employee or officer of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying
such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Partner or another Affiliate 
 70 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal
to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined in good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase). The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant
to paragraph (d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 (f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as
described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or
a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such
repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest
relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment
Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or (ii) above,
any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse
basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree; provided, that such indebtedness shall become fully
recourse to the extent and at the time provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be non-recourse or so limited, the Partnership may require an
assumption by the Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Partners; provided, that a Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor
Note(s), be obligated to accept any obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this Section 8.1), unless his or her prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment
Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to
which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion
his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such
proportions. 
 71 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

(g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1;
 provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement:
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interest); (ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain such
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment
shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof;
or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory
note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. (h) The Partnership will assist a
Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to
retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or
guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to
interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter 
 72 
 [2 nd AR LPA of Strategic Partners Fund Solutions Associates Real Estate VII L.P.] 

contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such
Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the
death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment
Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or
part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided, that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn
Partner s or Deceased or Totally Disabled Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason
therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning Vehicle (it being
understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General Partner in
connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General Partner shall
designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Partner and such Nonvoting
Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle
to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such Partner s right to
participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or the pledging or
granting of a security interest in, its entire Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital
Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws.

such Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment
Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment;
and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. The General Partner shall be the liquidator. In the
event that the General Partner is unable to serve as liquidator, a liquidating trustee shall be chosen by the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Partners voting at a meeting of Partners (excluding Nonvoting Special Partners). 
 Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner Interests . 
 (a) If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner
Interests which, in the judgment of the liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in each such
Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro
rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the liquidator shall determine.

may be deducted from the amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the
liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of
such Partner in any probable loss or liability on account of such transaction or claim. (c) Upon determination by the liquidator that
circumstances no longer require the exclusion of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as
provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS

invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act

has been formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such
provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. 
 Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to
the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided, that no person

to the Partnership, this Agreement, any related document or any transaction or investment contemplated hereby or thereby) taken or omitted by a Covered Person (other than any act or omission
constituting Cause), unless there is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that such Covered Person s conduct was unlawful. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of legal counsel to the Partnership, accountants and other experts or professional advisors, and no action taken by any
Covered Person in reliance on such advice shall in any event subject such person to any liability to any Partner or the Partnership. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating

permitted by law, the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless (but only to the extent of the Partnership s assets (including, without limitation, the remaining capital commitments of the Partners) each Covered Person from and against any
and all claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of
investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim), joint and several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, for purposes of this Section 3.6, Losses ), arising from
any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person s
management of the affairs of the Partnership or which relate to or arise out of or in connection with the Partnership, its property, its business or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of any act or omission of such Covered Person constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section with respect to any claim, issue or matter if there
is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interest of the Partnership and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such Covered Person s

Covered Person (including, without limitation, the General Partner) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval of the General Partner, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final
disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered
Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section, and the Partnership and its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such Covered Person s interests/investments in the Partnership and such Affiliates
and shall have the right to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such
Partner shall be responsible, up to the amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining capital commitment, for such Partner s pro rata share of the Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by
the General Partner. The 
 22 

Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will
not be personally obligated with respect to indemnification pursuant to this Section. The General Partner shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify
pursuant to this Section 3.6. (ii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty,
it is understood and/or agreed that the Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable
law governing SP VII and/or a particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the
following order of priority: first out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP VII, second by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment is
indirectly held, and third by SP VII (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). (B) The Partnership s
obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP VII and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue
of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP VII and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by
virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it is agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP VII and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General
Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be
permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing.

or in the Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner, that such Limited Partner is acquiring each of such Limited Partner s Interests for such Limited
Partner s own account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Limited Partner hereunder; provided ,
that a Partner may choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Limited Partner represents and warrants that such Limited Partner understands that the Interests have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore such Interests may not be resold without registration under such Act or exemption from such registration, and that accordingly such Limited Partner must bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner represents that such Limited Partner has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that such Limited Partner is capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, and that such Limited Partner is able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited Partner represents that such Limited Partner s overall commitment to the Partnership and
other investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Limited Partner s net worth and the Limited Partner has no need for liquidity in the Limited Partner s investment in Interests. Each Limited Partner
represents that to the full satisfaction of the 
 23 

Limited Partner, the Limited Partner has been furnished any materials that such Limited Partner has requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and has
been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information
relating thereto. Each Limited Partner represents that the Limited Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Limited Partner with the Limited Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters
concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Limited Partner. 
 (b) Each Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be true and correct as of any date
that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that such capital contribution shall
serve as confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

limited to IRS Form W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Partnership, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding W-8IMY ), or otherwise is correct and (ii) the Limited Partner will complete and return the applicable IRS form, including but not limited to a
 W-8BEN or W-8IMY, and (y) (i) the Limited Partner is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) and (ii) the Limited Partner will notify the

Partner. ARTICLE IV CAPITAL
OF THE PARTNERSHIP Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . (a) Each Partner shall be required to make capital
contributions to the Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required
Amounts as are required to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP VII in respect of the GP-Related SP VII Interest with respect to any GP-Related SP VII Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any;
 provided , that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each
Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing
business operations (as distinct from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Sections 4.1(d) and 5.8(d)) shall be determined by the General Partner. Limited Partners shall not be
required to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an
increase in such 
 24 

Limited Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided , that the General
Partner and any Limited Partner may agree from time to time that such Limited Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided further , that each
Investor Limited Partner shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage
from time to time and (ii) the total capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP VII Interest. 
 (b) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional
Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital
Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by the General Partner. 
 (c) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (d) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which certain amounts of distributions relating
to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a Holdback ). 
 (i) The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall
be withheld for any General Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner) and each Partner Category (such withheld percentage constituting a General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback
Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than any General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than any General Partner) and 5 for
Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for any General Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner) shall not
be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). (ii) The Holdback Percentage
may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a
proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in the
Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. 
 (iii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his Partner
Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners 
Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to
24 . The General Partner may not increase 
 25 

the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only
to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback
Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have
the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . (iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Partnership may increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners and the
General Partner (a Holdback Vote provided , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior
written consent; provided further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject
Partner) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not
exceed an amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for such Subject Partner s Partner Category; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject
Partner s successors or assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive
distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. 
 (B) A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners and the General Partner shall be
entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in person or by proxy. 
 (C) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject
Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually
satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided further ,
that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that
submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected out-of-pocket 
expenses relating thereto and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the
Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account to be controlled by Simpson Thacher Bartlett LLP, as escrow agent (or 
 26 

such other comparable law firm as the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall agree). The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with
such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is
insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party
shall be the Partnership, if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner
Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (D) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) (A) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the
 Excess Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his Holdback obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he was a Partner), to the extent his Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust Amounts (but
not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or otherwise making available
to the Partnership, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing
Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of
the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that in the case of entities listed in the books and records of the Partnership, in which Partners/members are permitted to pledge their interests therein to finance
all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or
Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the Partnership a second priority security interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to
the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding
documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity
listed in the books and records of the Partnership to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at
the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. 
 27 

(B) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm
Collateral (a Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to
fully satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary
to satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (C) Upon any
valuation or revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including
upon a Firm Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the
foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his Excess
Holdback requirement. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed
inapplicable to a default under this clause (C); provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting
Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution
Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (vi) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income
thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership
to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term
deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P and P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by
S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall
supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a
date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP VII, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose 

 28 

relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days
prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the
Partnership s obligations under the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash
and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his
L/C upon (1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm
Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his
Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner
Category of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by
the Partnership; provided, that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 (vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried
Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any
time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. (B) In lieu of the
foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the books and records of the Partnership;
 provided , that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback Amount for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs
4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback Amount specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B),
the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount from the Trust Account. (viii) (A) Any Limited Partner
or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by
the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback
distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is
necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) )to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 29 

(B) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other
realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying
Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash
contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust Account)), then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of
Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be
deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund
such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to his Holdback in cash or an L/C. (C) Upon any
valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the books and records of the Partnership), if such Partner s or Withdrawn
Partner s Special Firm Collateral valued at less than such Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the books and records of the Partnership, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback
hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 business days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm
Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that
clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to such default; provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term
 GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C). (D) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the
General Partner may revoke the ability of such Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause
(C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion
of the Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback). (E) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner from using any amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 30 

Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital
related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner,
capital invested in any other investment of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any
other time as determined by the General Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, or
(iii) as determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V

(i) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items that are deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are
allocable to such activity (determined as provided below). GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
any GP-Related Investment for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of means (i) the gross amount of
dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are

less (ii) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined in
accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for Federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from Federal income taxation and not otherwise taken into account in
computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value on the books of the Partnership that differs from its adjusted tax basis for Federal
income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset on the books of the Partnership pursuant
to Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any expenditures of the Partnership not deductible
in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this definition shall be treated as deductible items;
 
 31 

(v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in such GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership and Affiliates of the Partnership shall be allocated among the
Partnership and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner. Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid, unrealized losses, reserves
(including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items, shall be made in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP provided , that the General Partner shall not be required to make any such adjustment. (c) An accounting
period shall be a Fiscal Year except that, at the option of the General Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner,
if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner
may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to the Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (d) In
establishing GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such
factors as it deems appropriate. (e) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting
purposes under this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners,
all Withdrawn Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership
or any successor thereto. Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner on the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be appropriate, one or
more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP VII Interest
and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ). 
 (b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one or more of the Partners with respect
to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners

 32 

GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited with the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property
contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP VII Interest during such accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income
allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the interest credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such
accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be debited with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal
amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any property distributed to such Partner during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and (y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated to such Partner for such accounting period. 
 Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages . 
 (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting period pursuant to
Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , however , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (d) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (d) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately prior
to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end of
such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. (b) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of any category for any annual accounting period at the time specified in Section 5.3(a) for the annual fixing of GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a GP-Related Unallocated Percentage 
 provided , that any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the
General Partner within 90 days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (c) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 33 

Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net
Income (Loss) . (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the
Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related 
Investment of all the Partners participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of
 Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners, second, to Partners
that received Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP-Related Net Income is being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of
 GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the
same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed
if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the
Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP VII and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on
capital contributions made by the Partnership to SP VII with respect to the GP-Related SP VII Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s
 Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP VII and
 (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP VII and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s
(including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above, GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest
allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as
the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in
accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. 
 (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period
unrelated to SP VII, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such
accounting period. (e) The General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner
admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net
Income (Loss). Section 5.5. Liability of General Partners . General Partners shall have unlimited liability for the
satisfaction and discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. Section 5.6. Liability of Limited
Partners . Each Limited Partner and former Limited Partner shall be liable for the satisfaction and discharge of all losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership allocable to him pursuant to Section 5.4 or 7.3, but only to the extent
required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, in no event shall any Limited Partner or former Limited Partner be obligated to make any additional capital contribution to the Partnership in excess of his
aggregate GP-Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions 
 34 

pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 7.1, or have any liability in excess of such aggregate GP-Related Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions for the satisfaction and discharge of the losses, liabilities and expenses of the Partnership. In no way does any of the foregoing limit any Partner s obligations under Section 4.1(d), 5.8(d) or 7.4(g) or otherwise to make
capital contributions as provided hereunder. Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time
establish such repurchase rights and/or other requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP VII Investments as
the General Partner may determine. The General Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied,
(b) pay any distribution to any Partner that is Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously
established repurchase rights or other requirements from time to time, and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) (i) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or
other property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Sections 4.1(d) and 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing Percentages. 
 (ii) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP VII of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP VII) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP VII) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such
 GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 

 35 

(b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable
judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total Federal, New York State and New York City income
and other taxes that would be payable by such Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated
(i) on the assumption that each Partner is an individual subject to the then prevailing maximum Federal, New York State and New York City income and other tax rates, (ii) taking into account the deductibility of State and local income and
other taxes for Federal income tax purposes and (iii) taking into account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by the Partnership Act. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof
(together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the
applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase
Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP-Related Investment that remains
Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be
allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment,
or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of
unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new
Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Limited Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to
its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. (d)
(i)(A) If the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP VII a Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the GP-Related SP VII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback
Amount ), the Partnership shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the
Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the Partnership, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in
the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or
Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership, in the case of Clawback Amounts, and (II) with respect to a GP-Related 
Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related SP
VII Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP VII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an
interest in the GP-Related SP VII Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if 
 36 

the GP-Related Giveback Amount is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP VII Investment, all GP-Related SP VII Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call, such
Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written
instructions from the Partnership, or if applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related 
Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the
Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the
Clawback Amount and/or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as
promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such written instructions from the Partnership shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the Partnership may, in its discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the Partnership s judgment, the potential
obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account used
to pay any part of any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30
days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. Solely to the extent required by the SP VII Agreements, each
member of the General Partner shall have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and under Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) solely
with respect to such member s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in section 11.3(b) of the SP VII Partnership Agreement) and solely to the extent the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the
Partnership s obligations under section 11.3 of the SP VII Partnership Agreement and/or the corresponding provisions under any other SP VII Agreement. 
 (B) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the Partnership s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such
Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if
any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation
to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment
hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). 
 37 

(ii) (A) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a GP-Related Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the Partnership shall require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried
Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully
described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such
 GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the
Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the
Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such
default. (B) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either
(1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies
(at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the Partnership a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the
Partnership may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the Partnership as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The Partnership shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (C) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related 
Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust
Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution before seeking cash
contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution. 
 (iii) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. 
 38 

(e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is hereby authorized to)
take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating writedowns and losses (to be determined by the General Partner
in accordance with GAAP and as reported by SP VII) on GP-Related SP VII Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who
participated in such Loss Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related 
SP VII Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a
 GP-Related SP VII Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP VII Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall calculate
amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share of each such
Loss Investment based on his Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution to all Partners
(indirectly through the Partnership from SP VII) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 (B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject
Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP VII) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and 
 (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest
Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution, and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to satisfy such
negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Tax Rate in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions
(the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set
forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest
distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined (as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a
Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining
after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their
Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. 
 39 

A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount
promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. 
 A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the
extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). Any Net Carried Interest Distribution
Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner, including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the
Subject Investment; provided , that any such amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such
distribution (taken together with the other Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the
case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses in any GP-Related SP VII
Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount i.e. , the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP VII Investment with respect to which Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such
Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP VII Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 40 

Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the
General Partner shall be based on its good faith judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies
to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners. It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the
Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP VII Agreements. 
 Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and
miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner from time to time. 
 Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For Federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. (b) For Federal, State and local
income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each fiscal year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are allocated
among the Partners pursuant to clause (a) above, provided the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations have substantial economic effect or are in
accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as General Partners or Limited Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Sections 3.7 and 3.8. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner all terms of such additional Partner s participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each
additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Limited Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Limited Partner shall
not have such voting rights (any such Limited Partner being called a Nonvoting Limited Partner ). Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and
conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an 
 41 

Investor Note approved by the General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s
purchase of his Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any Additional
Partner may have a GP-Related Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. 
 (b) The GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of
the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General
Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all
other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner. (c) An
additional Partner shall be required to contribute to the Partnership his pro rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment
Investments in which such Partner does not acquire any interests, at such times and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Sections 4.1 and 7.1. 
 (d) The admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of, or counter-signature page
with respect to, this Agreement by such additional Partner, or (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional Partner, as determined by the General Partner, or (iii) the execution by such
additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a substitute or additional Limited Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such writing being accepted by the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the Trust Agreement. 
 Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner. The General Partner
generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner
to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided , that a Partner may not voluntarily Withdraw without the consent of the General Partner if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business; provided
further that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital
Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any
withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. 
 42 

(c) Upon the Total Disability of a Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be
a Limited Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided, however, that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting
Limited Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The
determination of whether any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement between the General Partner and such
Partner, each party shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If
the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest,
such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. (e) The
Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all
obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. 
 Section 6.3. GP-Related Partner Interests Not Transferable . 
 (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without the prior written consent of the General Partner; provided , that, subject to the Partnership Act, this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by operation of law,
transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further , that, subject to the prior written consent of the General
Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust, limited
partnership or limited liability company with respect to which such Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a
Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the interest transferred
(including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the
Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(a), no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or otherwise) of the
whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a General Partner or Limited Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent
may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire partnership interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a partner of the
Partnership. 
 43 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all Federal, State and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. General Partner Withdrawal; Transfer of General Partner s Interest . 
 (a) The General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its right to manage the affairs of
the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, with the prior written approval of a Majority In Interest of the Partners admit another person as an additional or substitute General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself
as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided , however , that the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the
Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise) and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part
of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under
this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership
and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security
interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as contemplated by clause (a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner
is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a General Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining General Partners and any one or more of such remaining General Partners continue the business
of the Partnership (any and all such remaining General Partners being hereby authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). If upon the Withdrawal of a General Partner there shall be no
remaining General Partner, the Partnership nonetheless shall not be dissolved and shall not be required to be wound up if, within 90 days after the occurrence of such event of Withdrawal, all remaining Limited Partners (excluding Withdrawn Partners)
agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more General Partners. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest . (a) The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related 
Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term
 Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Limited Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for
all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his Withdrawal Date; provided , that if
a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month in which his Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval,
if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on
capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained a Partner of the Partnership during such period. 
 44 

(c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner with respect to such Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall, promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). (e) (i) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss) or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for any reason other than

 GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related 
Investment) and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in

Withdrawn Partner was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Limited Partner) on his Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any
aggregate negative balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Limited Partner (other than a Special Limited Partner), upon the settlement of such Withdrawn

Accounts in accordance with their respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance
as determined by the General Partner as of such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be

(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the
case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative,
as the case may be, may elect, at the time described below, to receive a Nonvoting Limited Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest. The election referred to above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5. (f) For
purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest means his GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn Partner shall retain his percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his
 GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn
Partner shall become and remain a Limited Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so designates, such Limited Partner shall be a Nonvoting Limited Partner). The GP-Related Partner
Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms
and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to
this sentence. (g) The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to
paragraph (e) above, to have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by the General Partner)
of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner
under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. (h) [Intentionally omitted]. 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of
such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind distributions to be made
to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by the Withdrawn Partner in respect of the settlement
of his GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above or adjustments to
reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by the Withdrawn
Partner without examination of the 
 46 

accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of
payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or
distribution; provided that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of the
Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. 
 (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should prove,
in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his estate such
deficiency, as the case may be. (k) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after the Settlement
Date (e.g., outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date or shall be paid by
the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment
at a floating rate equal to the lesser of (x) the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as its prime rate or (y) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. The due
date of amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in respect of GP-Related Investments for which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph (f) above shall be 120 days after realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such amounts are determined to be payable. 
 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, encumbrance or other transfer by such Withdrawn
Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such Withdrawn Partner s right
to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his GP-Related Partner Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(r) of this
Section 6.5; provided , however , that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any GP-Related Investment in
which he has an interest as of his Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such
 GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn Partner his allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause
(x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the 
 47 

Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such
 GP-Related Investment as of his Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such
 GP-Related Investment as of his Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply the provisions of paragraph (f) above, provided , that the maximum amount of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any
 GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. (n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned on the compliance by such
Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a period not exceeding two
years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph (o) may elect to forfeit the
principal amount payable in the final installment of his subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such restrictions. 
 (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the General Partner) a
discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Limited Partner relating to another Limited Partner,
and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner pursuant to Section 6.3, if such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership. 
 (p) (i) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his estate. 
 (ii) The Partnership may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to
Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the Partnership will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If
the Withdrawn Partner (or his estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the Partnership will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 48 

(q) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General
Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make,
execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter
contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5, including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is
coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 6.6. Termination of the Partnership . The General Partner may dissolve the Partnership at any time on not less than 60
days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Sections, 6.5, which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the capital account balances of the Partners. 
 Section 6.7. Certain Tax Matters . (a) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be
allocated among the Partners for Federal, State and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be
provided herein or by the Code or other applicable law. To the extent U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Subchapter K of the Code (including under Sections 704(b) and (c) of the Code) or other applicable law require allocations
for tax purposes that differ from the foregoing allocations, the General Partner may determine the manner in which such tax allocations shall be made so as to comply more fully with such Treasury Regulations or other applicable law and, at the same
time, preserve the economic relationships among the Partners as set forth in this Agreement. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and
gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to
contain a qualified income offset as provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
 (b) The General Partner shall cause to be prepared all Federal, State and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such
returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of any such item or any other method or procedure related to the
preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he shall not, unless he provides prior notice of such action to
the Partnership, (i) treat, on his individual income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as
reflected on the Form K-1 or other information statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such
item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of an income tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters
Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his decision shall be final and 
 49 

binding upon, the Partnership and all Partners except to the extent a Partner shall properly elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the
Tax Matters Partner in connection therewith (including, without limitation, attorneys , accountants and other experts fees and disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and (C) no Partner shall have the right to
(1) participate in the audit of any Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership (unless he
provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising out of or in connection with any such audit,
amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or
claim for refund filed by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner
selected by the General Partner as the tax matters partner for purposes of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this
Section 6.8 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. 
 (c) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each Federal, State and local income tax return of such Partner
(including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. Section 6.8. Special Basis Adjustments . In
connection with any assignment or transfer of a Partnership interest permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the manner provided in Code Regulations Section 1.754-1(b), to make an election to adjust the basis of the Partnership s property in the manner provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.

by the Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Limited Partner and the
Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any
Limited Partner of such rate upon such Limited Partner s request; provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise
payable to such Limited Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained
herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Limited Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm

with the consent of the General Partner. Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be
allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
such Capital Commitment Investment. (b) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or 7.7 shall be
specially allocated to the electing Limited Partner. Section 7.4. Distributions .

of such Limited Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all interest payments due, the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes upon which
interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Limited Partner of an amount equal to the Federal, State and local income taxes on income
of the Partnership allocated to such Limited Partner for such year in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to
the limitation that the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner
 
 52 

Interests were all allocated to an individual subject to the then-prevailing maximum Federal, New York State and New York City tax rates (taking into account the extent to which such taxable
income allocated by the Partnership was composed of long-term capital gains and the deductibility of State and local income taxes for Federal income tax purposes)); provided, that additional amounts shall be paid to the Limited Partner pursuant to
this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Limited Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BCE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision
from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further, that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BCE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the

disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; (iv) Fourth, to the return
to such Limited Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such fiscal year relates or

fiscal year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other Sources (other than amounts of CC Carried Interest); 
 (v) Fifth, to the payment of principal (including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of
such Limited Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or

distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof..

clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BCE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Limited Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone, distributions shall be made pursuant to clauses
(i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the General Partner or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to

Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the
outstanding Investor Notes of such Limited Partner, until all such Limited Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed to such Limited Partner. 
 Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the discretion of the General Partner. At the General

principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Limited Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 7.4. (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a
Capital Commitment Investment is being considered by the Partnership or SP VII (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to
such Capital Commitment Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment
shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
Class A Interests. (g) (i) If the Partnership) is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP VII all or a
portion of a Giveback Amount with respect to the Capital Commitment SP VII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the Partnership shall call for
such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall 
 54 

contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the Partnership, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP VII Interest (the
 Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP VII Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback
Amount, or (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP VII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation. Each
Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the Partnership may, in the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no
obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or
any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the Partnership shall require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of
their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment
Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a
result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner in respect of such default.
Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors
considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership
expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting
Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting
Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the Partnership a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive
payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the Partnership may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Partner hereby appoints the Partnership as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of
the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The Partnership shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment
Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (B) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. 
 55 

(iii) A Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership
under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. Section 7.5. Valuations . Capital Commitment
Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any Affiliate of the Partnership that is a
general partner of SP VII) in valuing investments of SP VII or, in the case of investments not held by SP VII, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence. The
value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided , that the Capital Commitment
Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further , that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating solely to the
value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control of the
underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further , that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any
Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member of a General Partner. Section 7.6.
 Disposition Election . (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose
of a Capital Commitment Investment, the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment
Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s
pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained
Portion in the Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account
shall not be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 56 

(b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes

 Section 8.1. Limited Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as not subject to repurchase for
purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note
to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest
which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Limited Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided , that in the event that a Limited Partner prepays all or
any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Limited Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Blackstone, the Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further , that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be
determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Limited Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Limited Partner shall apply pro rata against
all of such Limited Partner s Investor Notes; provided , that such Limited Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BCE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Collateral
Entities specified by such Limited Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interests. (b) Upon a Limited Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, other than as a result of such Limited Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Limited Partner (the Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each
have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s) within 45 days of such Limited Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice,
but not the obligation, to require the Partnership, subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by the Partnership
or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest will be an amount equal to (i) the outstanding
principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be made in cash) and (ii) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to
(x) all interest paid by the Limited Partner on the portion of the principal amount of the Investor Note relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent plus (y) all Capital Commitment Net Losses
allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest;
 provided , that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his position as an officer for Cause, the amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General Partner s sole discretion, may be
deemed to 
 57 

equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income
received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount resulting from an exchange is negative, it shall be
payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests or, if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided , that the General Partner and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing
to a Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, his related Investor Note shall be payable in full. If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercise the right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the
Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his individual capacity, shall be payable in
accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his option, and the General Partner shall apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. To
the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital
Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Limited Partner,
such Limited Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Limited Partner shall for any purpose
hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and
allocations with respect to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant to Article VII and this Article VIII, subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)) to the extent, at the time, in the manner and in the amount otherwise payable to such Limited Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or
shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in
Section 9.2, neither his Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to
such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. 
 (d) If a Limited Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by
the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s death or Total Disability) as provided in Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount
shall be payable by or to the estate or personal representative in cash), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). In addition, in the case of the
death or Total Disability of a Limited Partner, if the estate or personal representative of such Limited Partner so requests in writing within 180 days of the Limited Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or
indirectly) of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability 
 58 

(such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership or its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all)
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Limited Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then current fiscal year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. Each Limited
Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his will to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate or personal
representative of such Limited Partner within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Limited Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other
property to the estate or personal representative in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a
Limited Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his ceasing to be an
employee or officer of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon 30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property
underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself another Limited Partner or another Affiliate of the General Partner) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph
(d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the Partnership or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 (f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as
described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the Partnership s designee(s), Blackstone may loan all or a
portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc.
or any of its Affiliates). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another person, all or any portion of such
repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest
relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment
Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or
(ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Limited Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Limited Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for such related indebtedness only on a
nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as such Limited Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree. If the 
 59 

indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not so limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Limited Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition
to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Limited Partners; provided , that a Limited Partner shall not, except as set forth in his Investor Note, be obligated to accept any personally recourse obligation unless his
prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness
financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income
(Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion his aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on
such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. (g) If a Partner is required
to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1;
 provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct member of a General Partner, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof; (ii) allow the Withdrawn
Partner to retain such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital
Commitment Investment shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital
Commitment Value thereof; or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. 
 (h) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his estate. 
 (i) The Partnership may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or
their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the Partnership will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner
(or his estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the Partnership will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s
 day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 60 

(j) Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably appoints each General Partner as such Limited
Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Limited Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute,
sign and file, on behalf of such Limited Partner, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in
this Section 8.1, including, without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Limited Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Limited Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an
interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Limited Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Limited Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Without the prior written consent of
the General Partner, no Limited Partner or former Limited Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided , that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn Partner s or deceased or Totally
Disabled Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Limited Partner to another Limited Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason
therefor, and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers, for estate planning purposes, of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an
Estate Planning Vehicle. Each Estate Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Limited Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Limited Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such
Nonvoting Limited Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate
Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Limited Partner of the Partnership, or acquire
such Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Limited Partner shall not cease to be a limited partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of, or the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire limited partner interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no Transfer of a Capital Commitment
Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all Federal, State and other applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws.

OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration
award. The parties acknowledge that the forum(s) designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another. 
 (ii) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such
invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act
or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Firm Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ),
a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and that the ownership of,
and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors, successors or assigns) has
licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a
 non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the
permission of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and
its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such termination,
the Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service mark or
otherwise. Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a vote of Partners at a meeting may
be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. 
 64 

Section 10.4. Letter Agreements; Schedules . The General Partner may, or may
cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages or any other matter. The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners Schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages
and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such Schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any
purpose whatsoever; provided that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement. Section 10.5. Governing
Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflict of laws. In particular, the Partnership has been formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the
rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be given its meaning to the maximum extent
permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third
Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor
to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have
any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Articles VI and VIII. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any
transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based on the
standards set forth in Sections 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and 7.4(g)(ii)(A), to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or any Capital Commitment Recontribution
Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and their respective
legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the SP VII Agreements, the limited partners in SP VII shall be third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of Sections
5.8(d)(i)(A) and 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in section 11.3 (b) of the SP VII Partnership Agreement). 
 Section 10.7. Partner s Will . Each Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall include in his or her will a
provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligation relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner, and each such Limited Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in
writing, that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Limited Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Interest is transferred
shall include a provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its substantial equivalent remains in such trust. In the event any Limited
Partner or Withdrawn Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.7 after the Partnership has notified such Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner of his or her failure to so comply and such failure to so comply is not cured
within 30 days of such notice, the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner until the time at which such party complies with the requirements of this Section 10.7. 
 65 

Section 10.8. Confidentiality . By executing this Agreement, each Partner
expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than the Partnership, another
Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business, financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally known to the public or the
securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided, however, that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law, rule,
regulation or custom to disclose. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee, representative
or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the name of, or
any other identifying information regarding (a) the Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any performance
information relating to any of the Partners or their investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax structure
information. Section 10.9. Notices . Whenever notice is required or permitted by this Agreement to be given, such notice shall
be in writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be given by hand delivery (including any courier service) or telecopy to any Partner at its address or telecopy number shown in the books and records of the Partnership or, if given to
the General Partner or the Partnership, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch, and (ii) if given by hand delivery, when delivered
to the address of such Partner or the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. Section 10.10. Counterparts .
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute a single instrument. 
 Section 10.11. Power of Attorney . Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and
lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file all instruments, documents
and certificates which, from time to time, may be required to set forth any amendment to this Agreement or may be required by this Agreement or by the laws of the United States of America, the State of Delaware or any other state in which the
Partnership shall determine to do business, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, to execute, implement and continue the valid and subsisting existence of the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall
survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the subsequent Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 10.12. Cumulative Remedies . Rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and do not preclude use of other
rights and remedies available under applicable law. Section 10.13. Legal Fees . Except as more specifically provided herein,
in the event of a legal dispute (including litigation, arbitration or mediation) between any Partner or Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership, arising in connection with any party seeking to enforce Section 4.1(d) or any other provision of this
Agreement relating to the Holdback, the Clawback Amount, the GP-Related Giveback Amount, the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount
or the Capital

unpaid after such date shall accrue interest at the Default Interest Rate. Section 10.14. Entire Agreement . This Agreement
embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set

 23 

omitted by a Covered Person (other than any act or omission constituting Cause), unless there is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or
determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority granted to such Covered
Person by this Agreement. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of legal counsel to the Partnership, accountants and other experts or professional advisors, and no action taken by any Covered Person in reliance on
such advice shall in any event subject such person to any liability to any Partner or the Partnership. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or
to another Partner, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such Partner acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any such other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions

costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim), joint and several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, for purposes of this Section 3.5(b),
 Losses ), arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person s management of the affairs of the Partnership or which relate to or arise out of or in connection with the Partnership, its property, its business or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions,
suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of any act or omission of such Covered Person constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 3.5(b) with respect to any claim, issue or matter if there is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good
faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement; provided further , that if such
Covered Person is a Partner or a Withdrawn Partner, such Covered Person shall bear its share of such Losses in accordance with such Covered Person s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in the Partnership

claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval of the General Partner, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the
Partnership of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to 
 24 

repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 3.5(b), and the Partnership
and its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such Covered Person s interests/investments in the Partnership and such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to
satisfy such repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such Partner shall be responsible, up to the amount of such Partner s Interests and remaining
capital commitments, for such Partner s pro rata share of the Partnership s expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the General Partner. The Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at
reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect to indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). The General Partner
shall have the authority to enter into separate agreements with any Covered Person in order to give effect to the obligations to indemnify pursuant to this Section 3.5(b). 
 (ii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty, it is understood and/or agreed that the
Partnership s obligations hereunder are not intended to render the Partnership as a primary indemnitor for purposes of the indemnification, advancement of expenses and related provisions under applicable law governing SP VIII and/or a
particular portfolio entity through which an Investment is indirectly held. It is further understood and/or agreed that a Covered Person shall first seek to be so indemnified and have such expenses advanced in the following order of priority:
 first , out of proceeds available in respect of applicable insurance policies maintained by the applicable portfolio entity and/or SP VIII; second , by the applicable portfolio entity through which such investment is indirectly held; and
 third , by SP VIII (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). (B) The Partnership s obligation,
if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Covered Person shall be reduced by any amount that such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from SP VIII and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any
applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by SP VIII and/or the applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue
of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it is agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against SP VIII and/or such portfolio entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General
Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be
permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing. 
 25

has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information
relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning
an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner. 
 (b) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner agrees that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph (a) above shall be
true and correct as of any date that such Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby agrees that

Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership and the General Partner may release confidential information or other information about the Limited Partner or Special Partner or related to such Limited Partner or Special Partner s
investment in the Partnership if the Partnership or the General Partner, in its or their sole discretion, determines that such disclosure is required by applicable law or regulation or in order to comply for an exception from, or reduced tax rate
of, tax or other tax benefit. Any such disclosure shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed on any such person by law or otherwise, and a Limited Partner or Special Partner shall have no claim
against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of their Affiliates for any form of damages or liability as a result of actions taken by the foregoing in order to comply with any disclosure obligations that the foregoing reasonably believe are

reserves the right to take any action and pursue any remedies at its disposal, including (i) requiring such Limited Partner or Special Partner to Withdraw for Cause and (ii) withholding or deducting any costs caused by such Limited

ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . (a) Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the
Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required
to satisfy the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to SP VIII in respect of the GP-Related SP VIII Interest with respect to any GP-Related SP
VIII Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any, or otherwise; provided, that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners based upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing
Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business operations (as distinct from
financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General Partner. Special Partners shall not be required to make
additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an increase in such
Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, that the General Partner and any Special Partner may agree from time to time that
such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided, further, that each Investor Special Partner shall maintain its
 GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total
capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP VIII Interest. (b) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to
Section 5.10. (c) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner
(including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any
 GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any
Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by
the General Partner. (d) (i) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which
certain amounts of the distributions relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a
 Holdback ). The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld
percentage constituting the General Partner s and such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 5 for Existing Partners (other than the
General Partner), 5 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than the General Partner) and 5 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback
Percentage for the General Partner and/or Holdings shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). 
 28 

(ii) The Holdback Percentage may not be reduced for any individual Partner
as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a proportionate basis. For example, if the
Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 4 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 4 and 4 , respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall
apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. (iii) The Holdback
Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners 
Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the
General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to 24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies
equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner
from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category, if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners,
Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to 4 , 4 and 4 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to 21 . 
 (iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General Partner may increase or decrease the
Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback Vote provided , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject
Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a
Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less than the
prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines, in such
Partner s 
 29 

good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or assigns (including such
Subject Partner s estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of
satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. (B) A
Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast
by any such Partner in person or by proxy. (C) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject
Partner s Holdback Percentage, such Subject Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided, that if the Partnership and the Subject
Partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such
candidates; provided further, that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator.
Each Subject Partner that submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected
 out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator,
pay the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with
such arbitration (including costs leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is
insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party
shall be the Partnership if the Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner
Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 (D) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly
provided herein with respect 
 30 

to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such
reduced Holdback Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (v) (A) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the
 Excess Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess
Holdback ), and such Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may
obtain the release of the Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback
obligation, by pledging, granting a security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess
Holdback obligation. Any Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the
General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s
books and records in which Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the
extent a first priority security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a second priority security
interest therein in the manner provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or
(y) if the General Partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in
the case of either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from
a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking
such action as is necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. (B)
If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback
requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including 
 31 

distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback
requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm
Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm Collateral Realization,
if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this
clause (C); provided further, that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon
which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (B) require the Partnership to
distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (x) short-term
deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at least A+ by
S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall
supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a
date earlier than the latest possible termination date of SP VIII, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal
 
 32 

to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The
Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under
the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the
termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the
extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback
obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category
of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. 
 (vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried
Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any
time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. (B) In lieu of the
foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s
books and records; provided, that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections
4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the
related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount from the Trust Account. (viii) (A) Any Limited Partner or
Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in
cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that
 
 33 

satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging or otherwise granting a security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis
all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to
satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority
security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral. 
 (B) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm
Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback)
is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in the Trust Account)), then
up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net
proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes
Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to
his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. (C) Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any
adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such
Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to make up such
deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided, that the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further, that for purposes of applying 
 34 

Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due pursuant to this clause (C). 
 (D) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may revoke the ability of such
Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn
Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback). (E) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner from using any
amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided, that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or (iii) as
determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V

the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP VIII Interest for any accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments described below), (x) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items
that are deductible from gross income, for such accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined as provided below); 
 35 

(ii) from any GP-Related Investment
for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment

 GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting
period less (y) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. (c) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall
be determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxation and not
otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value in the books of the Partnership that differs from its
adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset in
the books of the Partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any
expenditures of the Partnership not deductible in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this
definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in such GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership, Holdings and other Affiliates of the Partnership shall be
allocated among the Partnership, Holdings and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner.
Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid,
unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items shall be made in accordance with GAAP; provided , that the
General Partner shall not be required to make any such adjustment. 
 36 

(d) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal Year, except that, at the option of the General
Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event
referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to the Partners 
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments
to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting
period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (e) In establishing
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate. (f) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under
this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all Withdrawn
Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any
successor thereto. Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be appropriate, one or
more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related SP VIII Interest
and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ). 
 (b) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one or more of the Partners with respect
to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners 
 GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited

to such Partner for such accounting period. 
 37 

Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages . (a) Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing
percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting
period pursuant to Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate; provided , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (c) below and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment
established in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General
Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately
prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end
of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. (b) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of

 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a
 GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided , that any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner within 90 days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the
Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. (c) Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such
 GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the
General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 38 

Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related 
Net Income (Loss) . (a) Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net
Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such
 GP-Related Investment of all the Partners participating in such GP-Related Investment (including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the
amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to
Partners that received Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the
years such GP-Related Net Income is being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of
 GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the
same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed
if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. (b) GP-Related Net Loss of the
Partnership shall be allocated as follows: (i) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP VIII and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based
on capital contributions made by the Partnership to SP VIII with respect to the GP-Related SP VIII Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by SP VIII and
 (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by SP VIII and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s
(including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). 
 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above, GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest
allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as
the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in
accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. 
 (d) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period
unrelated to SP VIII, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such
accounting period. 
 39 

(e) The General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any
additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss). (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make
such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 5.5. Liability of Partners . Except as otherwise provided in the Partnership Act or as expressly provided in this
Agreement, no Partner shall be personally obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner solely by reason of being a Partner. In no event shall any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (i) be obligated to
make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or
Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally Omitted] . 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc. The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related SP VIII Investments as the General Partner may determine. The General
Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that is
Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. 
 Section 5.8. Distributions . 
 (a) (i) The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or
other property to Partners with respect to such Partners GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it
appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of, and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a).
Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest
Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing
Percentages. 
 40 

(ii) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by SP
VIII of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the
General Partner each Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s
 GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP VIII) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by SP VIII) relating to a GP-Related Investment excluding such
 GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of
 GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related 
Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership
shall make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income, and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof
(together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the
applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have 
 41 

the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the
Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP-Related Investment that remains Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall
be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be allocated among the remaining Partners with interests
in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment, or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in
such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Special Partner shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. (d) (i) (A) If
the Partnership is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to SP VIII a Clawback Amount or a Giveback Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) in respect of the
 GP-Related SP VIII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related 
Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to
the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried 
Interest in the case of a GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a
Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with
(a) the GP-Related SP VIII Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are
insufficient to satisfy such GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related SP VIII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts
received by the Partners with an interest in the GP-Related SP VIII Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount
pursuant to an applicable SP VIII Agreement is unrelated to a specific GP-Related SP VIII Investment, all GP-Related SP VIII Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn
Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if
applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ), irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs 
obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions; provided , that to the extent a 
 42 

Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or
her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further ,
that such written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its
discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of
the aggregate amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be
required by the General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. (B) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has
satisfied any Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment
into the Trust Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of
(I) such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the
Trustee(s) shall take such steps as are necessary to release such Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the
satisfaction of the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall
constitute a default under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the SP
VIII Partnership Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under
Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the SP VIII Partnership
Agreement. (ii) (A) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such GP-Related Defaulting
Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried Interest Give Back Percentages in 
 43 

the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts
(as more fully described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if
the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the
Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the
Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e), no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net GP Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in
respect of such default. (B) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the
Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or
(2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately
reimbursed by the GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 44 

(C) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first
seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency
Contribution before seeking cash contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution.
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute. 
 (iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this
Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is
hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by allocating Losses (as defined in the SP VIII
Agreements) on GP-Related SP VIII Investments that have been the subject of a writedown and/or losses (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments
based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related SP VIII Investments. Consequently and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). 
 (i) At the time the Partnership is making Carried Interest distributions in connection with a
 GP-Related SP VIII Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any SP VIII Agreement as a result of one or more Loss Investments, the General Partner shall calculate
amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A) determine each Partner s share of each such
Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest distributions otherwise available for distribution to all
Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from SP VIII) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 (B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject
Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from SP VIII) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and 
 45 

(C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from
(II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net
Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Income Tax Rate (as defined in the SP VIII Agreements)
in effect in the Fiscal Years of such distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess
 Tax-Related Amount, defer such amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest
otherwise distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is
determined (as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of
negative Net Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution
shall be allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. 
 A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as
provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. A Partner
may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to
the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). 
 Any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner, including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as
provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the Subject Investment; provided , that any such amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so
distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such distribution (taken together with the other Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner to
date). 
 46 

(ii) In the case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be contributed to
the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Losses (as defined in the SP VIII Agreements) in any GP-Related SP VIII Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount (i.e., the Losses that followed the last GP-Related SP VIII Investment with respect to which Carried
Interest distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related SP VIII Investments; 
 (B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest
Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract the amount determined in clause (B) above from
the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount ). 
 A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to
the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a
positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner. To the
extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount
was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of
each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the SP VIII Agreements. Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The
Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner
from time to time. 
 47 

Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . 
 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s
Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single capital account is maintained in compliance with
the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. (b) All items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided herein or by the Code or other applicable law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in
accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are in
accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. (c) For U.S. federal, state
and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are
allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 5.10; provided , that the General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations
have substantial economic effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority to any item of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an adjustment to any Partner s distributive share thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined by the General Partner) in
accordance with the final resolution of such audit adjustment.

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . 
 (a) Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the
General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and certifications with respect to itself set
forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms of such additional Partner s
participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution,
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time
unless, upon the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special Partner ).
Any additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the
General Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or
subsequent holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a GP-Related 
Partner Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. (b) The
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other
Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be
allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by
the General Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any further act, vote or consent of any person, to make adjustments to the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to other Partners of the
Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. (c) An additional Partner shall be required to
contribute to the Partnership his or her pro rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner
does not acquire any interests, at such times and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. 
 49 

(d) The admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a
counterpart copy of this Agreement by such additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional Partner, as determined by the General Partner and / or (iii) the execution by
such additional Partner of any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such writing being acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership.
In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the Trust Agreement that is acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership. Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . 
 (a) Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner, including if such
Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business. Without
limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less
than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between such Partner and the General Partner); provided, that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership
with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from
the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. 
 (b) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any
Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. (c) Upon the Total Disability of a
Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided, that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn
Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest as the
General Partner may determine. The determination of whether any Partner has suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement
between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. 
 (d) If the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has
given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership (whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or
with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such person s
 GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, as of a date 
 50 

specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in
reasonable detail. (e) The Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect the obligations of the
other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its acts or omissions as a
General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. Section 6.3. GP-Related 
Partner Interests Not Transferable . (a) No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or
encumber all or any portion of such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided, that this Section 6.3 shall
not impair transfers by operation of law, transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further, that, subject to the prior
written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to
any estate planning trust, limited partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate
Planning Vehicle will be a Nonvoting Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to
the Partnership (including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require any Estate
Planning Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance,
operation of law or otherwise) of the whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which
consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a Partner of the Partnership.
 (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related 
Partner Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 51 

Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . 
 (a) Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its
right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute
General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise); provided however, that the General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise)
and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of
liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner
and shall have the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general partner of the Partnership upon the
collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. (b) Except as
contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or

Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. 
 (c) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or
remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interests . (a) The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For
purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined
under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Special
Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. (b) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his or her Withdrawal Date;
 
 52 

provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the
last day of the month in which his or her Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained
a Partner of the Partnership during such period. (c) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General
Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner
Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or
not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. (d) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn
Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided
in paragraph (f) below). (e) (i) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment)
and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in paragraph
(f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of 
 53 

paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an aggregate negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the
Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided, that if the Withdrawn Partner was solely a Special Partner on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be
required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative balance in the GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was
solely a Special Partner, upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other
Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the General Partner as of such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the
Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this
Section 6.5(e), in the case of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s
estate or legal representative, as the case may be, may elect, at the time described below, to receive a Nonvoting Special Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Investor Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest. The election referred to above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5. (f) For
purposes of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest means his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant
 GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn Partner shall retain his or her percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn
Partner shall become and remain a Special Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so designates, such Special Partner shall be a Nonvoting Special Partner). The GP-Related Partner
Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms
and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to

 pro rata share (as determined by the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other
investments are distributed in kind to a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the
Partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. 
 (h) [Intentionally omitted]. 
 (i) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of
such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated promissory note and in kind distributions to be made

adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by
the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of
payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to the applicable date of payment or
distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year before the Withdrawal Date of
the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question. 
 (j) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should prove,
in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or her
estate such deficiency, as the case may be. (k) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after the
Settlement Date e.g. , outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement Date
or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due date to

 55 

of amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts payable to

 (l) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of a security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. (m) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with

 (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any GP-Related Investment in
which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause
(x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such
 GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply the provisions of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount
of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any
 GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. 
 56 

(n) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned
on the compliance by such Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a
period not exceeding two years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph
(n) may elect to forfeit the principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such
restrictions. (o) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the

Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate.
 (ii) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance
to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such
professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (r) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful
agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner,

and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns to be timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the
appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the
treatment of any such item or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any and all elections permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner
agrees that he or she shall not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to his or her
interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information statement furnished by the Partnership to such Partner
for use in preparing his or her income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of an income tax audit of any tax return of the
Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or
in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his or her decision shall be final and binding upon, the Partnership
and all Partners except to the extent a Partner shall properly elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in connection therewith (including, without limitation,
attorneys , accountants and other experts fees and disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and (C) no Partner shall have the right to (1) participate in the audit of any Partnership tax return, (2) file

(4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the Partnership or the Tax Matters
Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the 
 58 

Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as the partnership representative (as defined
under the Code) (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other Partners from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.7 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. (c) Each individual Partner shall
provide to the Partnership copies of each federal, state and local income tax return of such Partner (including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. 
 (d) To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership holds an interest) is
or may be required by law to withhold or to make tax payments, including interest and penalties on such amounts, on behalf of or with respect to any Partner, including pursuant to Section 6225 of the Code Tax Advances ), the General
Partner may withhold or escrow such amounts or make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner shall, at the option of the General Partner, (i) be promptly paid to the Partnership by the Partner on whose
behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for
that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner,
for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the Partnership) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income
attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from the Partnership or any Transfer of a Partner s interest.
 Section 6.8. Special Basis Adjustments . In connection with any assignment or transfer of a Partnership interest
permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the manner provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.754-1(b), to

 (a) (i) This Article VII and Article VIII hereof set forth certain terms and conditions with respect to the Capital Commitment Partner
Interests and the Capital Commitment SP VIII Interest and matters related to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment SP VIII Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VII or in Article VIII, the
terms and provisions of this Article VII and Article VIII shall not apply to the GP-Related Partner Interests or the GP-Related SP VIII Interest. 
 (ii) Each Partner severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related
Capital Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to SP VIII in respect of the Capital Commitment SP VIII Interest, if any, and the related Capital Commitment SP VIII Commitment, if any (including,
without limitation, funding all or a portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment). No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in an amount in excess of such Partner s Capital
Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will not necessarily participate in each Capital
Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage with respect to (i) the
Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment, or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of any Commitment Agreement or
SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall limit or dictate the terms
upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related
Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 (b) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing Party may in its sole discretion advance to
any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions due to the Partnership from such Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Partner shall pay interest to the Advancing Party on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm
Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm
Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the
interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such rate upon such Partner s request;
 provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum 
 60 

interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay such Firm
Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances; provided , that (i) the
Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable
law. Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . 
 (a) There shall be established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later
date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital
Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such
Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her
Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. (b) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to
any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the
disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or
redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. Section 7.3. Allocations . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital
Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment
Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate
Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be
allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
such Capital Commitment Investment. 
 61 

(b) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6 or
Section 7.7 shall be specially allocated to the electing Partner. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make
such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose.

distributions to such Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including, without limitation, Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests)

General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected

interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); 
 (ii) Second, to distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on income of
the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to the limitation that
the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an individual subject to the
then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes (including, without limitation, taxes imposed under Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character of such taxable income allocated by the
Partnership and the limitations on deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes); provided, that additional amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount
reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided
further, that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BE Agreements

Contributions made in respect of the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Entity (other than the
Partnership) in respect of interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not
repaid from amounts of Other Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); (v) Fifth, to
the payment of principal (including any previously deferred amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid
and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 
of any Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to
the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by
the Lender or Guarantor; and (vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income
remaining after making the distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to
clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed
to such Partner. 
 63 

Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the
discretion of the General Partner. At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal payable on his or her
Investor Notes for the full period in respect of which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 (d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a Capital Commitment Investment
is being considered by the Partnership or SP VIII (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to such Capital Commitment
Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment
shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
Class A Interests. 
 64 

(g) (i) If the Partnership is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to
SP VIII a Giveback Amount with respect to any Capital Commitment SP VIII Interest (the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback
Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the
Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment SP VIII Interest (the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which
equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the Capital Commitment SP VIII Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to
clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital Commitment SP VIII Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation and (c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an
applicable SP VIII Agreement is unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment SP VIII Investment, all Capital Commitment SP VIII Investments. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in
respect of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). 
 (ii) (A) In the event any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or
any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts from any such
 GP-Related Defaulting Party and (ii) require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing
Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment
Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment
Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution
be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner s in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good
faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital
Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting 
 65 

Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts
otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting
Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General Partner may sell, collect or otherwise
realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to
collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default
Interest Rate. (B) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution shall cause such
Partner to be a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (iii) A Partner s obligation to make
contributions to the Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. 
 Section 7.5. Valuations . Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such
other times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by the Partnership (or any other Affiliate of the Partnership that is a general partner of SP VIII) in valuing investments of SP VIII or, in the
case of investments not held by SP VIII, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the
 Capital Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided, that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined
appropriate by the General Partner in good faith; provided further, that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the
underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by
applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further, that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct member or
partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. 
 66 

Section 7.6. Disposition Election . 
 (a) At any time prior to the date of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment,
the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such
Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such
Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the
Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not
be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that such
Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. 
 (b) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or
simultaneously with such distribution. Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . 
 (a) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request
from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a
 Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 (b) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to
or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. ARTICLE VIII 
 WITHDRAWAL; ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS 
 Section 8.1. Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . 
 (a) Capital Commitment Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as
 Non-Contingent for purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment
Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount
of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Partner may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided, that in the
event that a Partner 
 67 

prepays all or any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate
thereof, the Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further,
that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be determined in accordance with the determination of the purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below.
Prepayments made by a Partner shall apply pro rata against all of such Partner s Investor Notes; provided, that such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments that are related to one
or more Blackstone Entities specified by such Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. (b) (i) Upon a Partner ceasing to be an officer
or employee of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such Partner dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right
(exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s) within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the
obligation, to require the Partnership (subject to the prior consent of the General Partner, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn
Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by the Partnership or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 (ii) The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be an amount equal to (A) the
outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the Adjustment Amount equal to
(x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to be repurchased, plus (y) all Capital
Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on the Contingent portion of such Capital
Commitment Interest; provided, that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the Adjustment Amount, in the General Partner s
sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next Capital Commitment Net Income received by such
holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative, it shall be payable to the holders of the purchased
Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time
such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or (B) if the 
 68 

Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn
Partner at the time of such purchase; provided, that the Partnership and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining
Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. 
 (iii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an officer or employee, all Investor Notes shall become fully recourse to the
Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). 
 (iv) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the Partnership nor its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner
in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the Partnership shall apply such prepayments
against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. (v) To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a
Capital Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. 
 (c) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and
the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant
to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time, in the manner and
in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise
and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon
the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General
Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. 
 69 

(d) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital Commitment
Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability) (and the purchase price for such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in
cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such Contingent
Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, so requests in writing within
180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership
or its designee may but is not obligated to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then current
Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his or her will to reflect such provisions of
this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, within 30 days of the first date on which the General
Partner knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the
Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. 
 (e) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an employee or officer of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon
30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership
or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself
another Partner or another Affiliate of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital
Commitment Value thereof (determined in good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase). The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph
(d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 70 

(f) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or
portion thereof which is purchased by it as described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General
Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the
foregoing who is an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or
purchased by another person, all or any portion of such repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to
which the repurchased Capital Commitment Interest relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the
Partnership itself as an unallocated Capital Commitment Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to
Partners as provided in clause (i) and/or (ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be
deemed to be Contingent and shall become Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners receiving such allocations shall be responsible for
such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise agree; provided,
that such indebtedness shall become fully recourse to the extent and at the time provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be non-recourse or so
limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to such Partners; provided, that a Partner shall not, except as
set forth in his or her Investor Note(s), be obligated to accept any obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this Section 8.1), unless his or her prior consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the
Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an
obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated
to each Partner in the proportion his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership
allocable to all Partners in such proportions. 
 71 

(g) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1;
 provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement:
 (i) purchase for cash all of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of (A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent 
Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interest); (ii) allow the Withdrawn Partner to retain such
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment
shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing Capital Commitment Value thereof;
or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory
note shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. (h) The Partnership will assist a
Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this
assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to
retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or
guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to
interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (j) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without
limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 72 

Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment
Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or
part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided, that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn
Partner s or Deceased or Totally Disabled Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another Partner of Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason
therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning Vehicle (it being
understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General Partner in
connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General Partner shall
designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Partner and such Nonvoting
Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate Planning Vehicle
to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such Partner s right to
participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or the pledging or
granting of a security interest in, its entire Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital
Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws.

Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro
rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the liquidator shall determine. 
 (b) If there is any pending transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital
Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the liquidator, be then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to
such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may
meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on
account of such transaction or claim. 
 74 

(c) Upon determination by the liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion
of any Securities or other property or retention of sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such
Securities or other property or the proceeds realized from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . (a) Any and all disputes which cannot be settled
amicably, including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement
(including the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as any and all disputes arising out of, relating to or in connection with the termination, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership), whether arising during
the existence of the Partnership or at or after its termination or during or after the liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York U.S.A., in accordance
with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the
International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration
proceedings. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may cause the Partnership to bring,
on behalf of the General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary
relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this Section 10.1 to any such
action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably
appoints the General Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who shall promptly advise such Partner of any such service of
process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Partner in any such action or proceeding. 
 75 

(c) (i) EACH PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED
IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration
award. The parties acknowledge that the forum(s) designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another. 
 (ii) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable law, such
invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act
or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Blackstone Name . The Partnership acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ), a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and
that the ownership of, and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM, which company (or its predecessors,
successors or assigns) has licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the BLACKSTONE mark and name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and authorized activities with the permission
of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and its
Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly following any such termination, the
Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar thereto as a service mark or otherwise.
 
 76 

Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken
by a vote of Partners at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. 
 Section 10.4. Letter Agreements; Schedules . The General Partner may, or may cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously
entered, into separate letter agreements with individual Partners, officers or employees with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, benefits or any
other matter, which letter agreements have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing, the terms of this Agreement with respect to any such Partner and such matters. The parties hereto agree that any rights established, or
any terms of this Agreement altered or supplemented, in any such separate letter agreement, including any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, shall govern solely with respect to such Partner notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.
The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever; provided,
that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. Section 10.5. Governing
Law , Separability of Provisions . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been formed
pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall be
given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. 
 Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall, subject to
the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a trustee of a trust which is or becomes a party hereto; provided, that no person
claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on
any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall remain liable for the obligations under this
Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any transferee of all or any portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines, in its good faith judgment, based on the standards set forth in Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and Section 7.4(g)(ii)(A),
to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) from the transferee with respect to any such obligations.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and their respective legal 
 77 

representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the SP VIII Agreements, (x) the limited partners in SP VIII shall be
third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in
Section 9.4(a) of the SP VIII Partnership Agreement) and (y) the amendment of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount
(for purpose of this sentence, as defined in Section 9.4(a) of the SP VIII Partnership Agreement), in a manner materially adverse to such limited partners shall be effective against such limited partners only with the 66 2 3 Combined Limited Partner Consent (as such term is used in the SP VIII Partnership Agreement). 
 Section 10.7. Confidentiality . 
 (a) By executing this Agreement, each Partner expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or
not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any person other than the Partnership, another Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business,
financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall not be generally known to the public or the securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided , that any corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law, rule, regulation or custom to disclose. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee, representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding (a) the
Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any performance information relating to any of the Partners or their
investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax structure information. 
 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or impede any Partner from communicating, cooperating or filing a complaint on possible
violations of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation to or with any governmental agency or regulatory authority (collectively, a Governmental Entity ), including, but not limited to, the SEC, FINRA, EEOC or NLRB, or from
making other disclosures to any Governmental Entity that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation; provided, that in each case such communications and disclosures are consistent with
applicable law. Each Partner understands and acknowledges that (a) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any U.S. federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in
confidence to a U.S. federal, state, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other
proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (b) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation 
 78 

of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade
secret under seal; and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Moreover, a Partner shall not be required to give prior notice to (or get prior authorization from) Blackstone regarding any such communication or disclosure.

number shown in the Partnership s books and records or, if given to the General Partner, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch and
(ii) if given by hand delivery, when delivered to the address of such Partner, the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. 
 Section 10.9. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original
and all of which together shall constitute a single instrument. For the avoidance of doubt, a Person s execution and delivery of this Agreement by electronic signature and electronic transmission (jointly, an Electronic Signature ),
including via DocuSign or other similar method, shall constitute the execution and delivery of a counterpart of this Agreement by or on behalf of such Person and shall bind such Person to the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
this Agreement and any additional information incidental hereto may be maintained as electronic records. Any Person executing and delivering this Agreement by an Electronic Signature further agrees to take any and all reasonable additional actions,
if any, evidencing its intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, as may be reasonably requested by the General Partner. 
 Section 10.10. Power of Attorney . Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true
and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file all instruments,
documents and certificates which, from time to time, may be required to set forth any amendment to this Agreement or may be required by this Agreement or by the laws of the United States of America, the State of Delaware or any other state in which
the Partnership shall determine to do business, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, to execute, implement and continue the valid and subsisting existence of the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall
survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the subsequent Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall survive and shall not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 79 

Section 10.11. Partner s Will . Each Partner and
Withdrawn Partner shall include in his or her will a provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligations relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner and each such Partner and Withdrawn Partner
shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn
Partner s Interest is transferred shall include a provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its substantial equivalent remains
in such trust. In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.11 after the Partnership has notified such Partner or Withdrawn Partner of his or her failure to so comply and such failure to
so comply is not cured within 30 days of such notice, the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Partner until the time at which such party complies with the requirements of this Section 10.11. 
 Section 10.12. Cumulative Remedies . Rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and do not preclude use of other
rights and remedies available under applicable law. Section 10.13. Legal Fees . Except as more specifically provided
herein, in the event of a legal dispute (including litigation, arbitration or mediation) between any Partner or Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership, arising in connection with any party seeking to enforce Section 4.1(d) or any other provision
of this Agreement relating to the Holdback, the Clawback Amount, the GP-Related Giveback Amount, the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, the Net GP-Related 
Recontribution Amount or the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount, the losing party to such dispute shall promptly reimburse the victorious party for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
dispute (such determination to be made by the relevant adjudicator). Any amounts due under this Section 10.13 shall be paid within 30 days of the date upon which such amounts are due to be paid and such amounts remaining unpaid after such date
shall accrue interest at the Default Interest Rate. Section 10.14. Entire Agreement ; Modifications . This
Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those
expressly set forth or referred to herein. Subject to Section 10.4, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Except as provided herein, this Agreement may be
amended or modified at any time by the General Partner in its sole discretion, upon notification thereof to the Limited Partners. 
 Section 10.15. Section Titles . The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience and reference purposes only and
shall not be deemed to alter or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement. 
 80 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the day and
year first above written. In the event that it is impracticable to obtain the signature of any one or more of the Partners to this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding among the other Partners executing the same.

to this Section 3.5(b). (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for greater certainty, it is understood

by BETP IV and fourth by Associates IV (only to the extent the foregoing sources are exhausted). (A) The

(including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), and to the extent the Partnership (or any Affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid any amounts that should have been paid by Associates IV, BETP IV and/or the
applicable portfolio entity (including by virtue of any applicable insurance policies maintained thereby), it is agreed among the Partners that the Partnership shall have a subrogation claim against Associates IV and/or BETP IV and/or such portfolio
entity in respect of such advancement or payments. The General Partner and the Partnership shall be specifically empowered to structure any such advancement or payment as a loan or other arrangement (except for a loan to an executive officer of
Blackstone Inc. or any of its Affiliates, which shall not be permitted) as the General Partner may determine necessary or advisable to give effect to or otherwise implement the foregoing.

requested relating to the Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests and any
matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any other additional information relating thereto. Each Limited Partner and Special Partner represents that the Partner has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Partner with the
Partner s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Partner.

information or other information about the Limited Partner or Special Partner or related to such Limited Partner or Special Partner s investment in the Partnership if the Partnership or the General Partner, in its or their sole discretion,
determines that such disclosure is required by applicable law or regulation or in order to comply for an exception from, or reduced tax rate of, tax or other tax benefit. Any such disclosure shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon
the disclosure of information imposed on any such person by law or otherwise, and a Limited Partner or Special Partner shall have no claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of their Affiliates for any form of damages or liability
as a result of actions taken by the foregoing in order to comply with any disclosure obligations that the foregoing reasonably believe are required by law, regulation or otherwise. 
 (c) Each Limited Partner and Special Partner acknowledges and agrees that if it provides information that is in anyway materially misleading,
or if it fails to provide the Partnership or its agents with any information requested hereunder, in either case in order to satisfy the Partnership s obligations, the General Partner reserves the right to take any action and pursue any
remedies at its disposal, including (i) requiring such Limited Partner or Special Partner to Withdraw for Cause and (ii) withholding or deducting any costs caused by such Limited Partner s or Special Partner s action or inaction
from amounts otherwise distributable to such Limited Partner or Special Partner from the Partnership and its Affiliates.

ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
 Section 4.1. Capital Contributions by Partners . Each Partner shall be required to make capital contributions to the Partnership GP-Related Capital Contributions at such times and in such amounts (the GP-Related Required Amounts as are required to satisfy
the Partnership s obligation to make capital contributions to Associates IV in respect of the GP-Related Associates IV Interest to fund Associates IV s capital contributions with respect to any GP-Related BETP IV Investment and as are otherwise determined by the General Partner from time to time or as may be set forth in such Limited Partner s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, if any, or
otherwise; provided , that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be made pro rata among the Partners
based upon each Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts which are to be used
for ongoing business operations (as distinct from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Partnership (including those specifically set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Section 5.8(d))) shall be determined by the General Partner.
Special Partners shall not be required to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts, except
(i) as a condition of an increase in such Special Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided , that the General Partner
and any Special Partner may agree from time to time that such Special Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership; provided further , that each Investor
Special Partner shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time
to time and (ii) the total capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related BETP IV Interest. 
 (a) Each GP-Related Capital Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.10. 
 (b) The General Partner may elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any Partner (including any additional
Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of any GP-Related Capital
Contribution required to be made by such Partner or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc.
or any Affiliate thereof) to make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in installments, in each case on terms determined by the General Partner. 
 (c) The Partners and the Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant to which certain amounts of the distributions
relating to Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account constituting a Holdback ). The General Partner shall
determine, as set forth below, the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall be withheld for any General Partner and/or Holdings and each Partner Category (such withheld percentage constituting the General Partner s and
such Partner Category s Holdback Percentage ). The 
 28 

applicable Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0 for any General Partner, 15 for Existing Partners (other than the General Partner), 21 for Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than the
General Partner) and 24 for Deceased Partners (the Initial Holdback Percentages ). Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for the General Partner and/or Holdings shall not be
subject to change pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d). (i) The Holdback Percentage may
not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a
proportionate basis. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is decreased to 12.5 , the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 17.5 and 20 , respectively. Any reduction
in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such reduction. 
 (ii) The Holdback Percentage may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the other Partners in his or her
Partner Category (except as provided in clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the Retaining Withdrawn Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 21 unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing Partners 
Holdback Percentage to 21 . The General Partner may not increase the Deceased Partners Holdback Percentage beyond 24 unless the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to
24 . The General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24 unless such increase applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to
distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category (following a reduction of the
Holdback Percentages below the Initial Holdback Percentages), if the resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn
Partners and Deceased Partners to 12.5 , 17.5 and 20 , respectively, the General Partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to the Initial Holdback Percentages. 
 (iii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General Partner may increase or decrease the Holdback
Percentage for any Partner in any Partner Category (in such capacity, the Subject Partner pursuant to a majority vote of the Limited Partners (a Holdback Vote provided , that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Holdback Percentage applicable to any General Partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent; provided further , that a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage shall not
be (I) increased prior to such time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner, been given
30 days to gather and provide information to the Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject Partner s
Holdback Percentage 
 29 

pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv); provided further , that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage is less
than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Partner Category of such Subject Partner; provided further , that a Partner shall not vote to increase a Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Partner determines,
in such Partner s good faith judgment, that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such Subject Partner, or any of such Subject Partner s successors or assigns (including such Subject Partner s estate
or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related Partner Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become due. (A) A Holdback Vote shall take
place at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Limited Partners shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in
person or by proxy. (B) If the result of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage, such Subject Partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree
upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates;
 provided further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the
arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated expenses i.e ., both the Subject Partner s and the Partnership s expenses) into an escrow account. The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs
leading thereto) and to return to the victorious party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses of such
arbitration, such losing party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such victorious party. For purposes hereof, the victorious party shall be the Partnership if the Holdback
Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject Partner s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner
shall be the victorious party. The party that is not the victorious party shall be the losing party. 
 30 

(C) In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner s Holdback
Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner any Trust
Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as expressly provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner s reduced
Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject Partner s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback Vote under this clause (iv). 
 (iv) If a Partner s Holdback Percentage exceeds 15 (such percentage in excess of 15 constituting the Excess
Holdback Percentage ), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his or her Holdback obligation in respect of his or her Excess Holdback Percentage (such portion constituting such Partner s Excess Holdback ), and such
Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he or she was a Partner), to the extent his or her Excess Holdback obligation has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the Trust
Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging, granting a
security interest or otherwise making available to the General Partner, on a first priority basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his or her Firm Collateral in satisfaction of his or her Excess Holdback obligation. Any Partner
seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a
first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that, in the case of entities listed in the Partnership s books and records in which
Partners are permitted to pledge or grant a security interest over their interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions thereto Pledgable Blackstone Interests ), to the extent a first priority
security interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the General Partner a second priority security interest therein in the manner
provided above; provided further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest is available, or (y) if the General Partner
otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall (in the case of either clause
(x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in the Partnership s books and records to remit any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral
Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in taking such action as is
necessary to enable such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder. 
 31 

(A) If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm
Collateral (a Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to
fully satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement (allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary
to satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. (B) Upon any
valuation or revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement (including
upon a Firm Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Excess Holdback requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the
foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy his or her
Excess Holdback requirement. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that clause (A) of Section 5.8(d)(ii)
shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this clause (C); provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term
 GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C). (v) Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner may (A) obtain the release of any Trust
Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or
(B) require the Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit (an L/C for the benefit of the
Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an L/C Partner shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a commercial
bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at least A-1 by S P or P-1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term
deposits are rated at least A+ by S P or A1 by Moody s (if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a Required Rating ). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant
Required Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In
addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination date of BETP IV, the 
 32 

Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating,
at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause (I) below) draw
down on an L/C only if (I) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner s obligation relating to the Partnership s obligations under the Clawback Provisions or (II) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C from a
commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C
in accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his or her L/C upon (1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the Partnership s obligations, if any, in
respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his or her entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership,
of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his or her Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed
by the Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of such L/C Partner, the L/C of an L/C Partner may be reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion
satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C
Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount. (vi) Any
 in-kind distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose
of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed to the Trust Account. 
 (A) In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge or grant a security interest with respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the applicable category in the Partnership s books and records; provided , that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral
shall initially equal 130 of the required Holdback for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115 of the required Holdback. Sections 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent such
Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount from the Trust Account. 
 (vii) Any Limited Partner or Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may, to the extent his or her Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided herein,
 
 33 

obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such Partner s or
Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging or granting a security interest to the Trustee(s) on a first priority basis all of his or her Special Firm Collateral in a particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times
must equal or exceed the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such Partner s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall sign such documents
and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to realize on (if required),
such Special Firm Collateral. (A) If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any
portion of any Special Firm Collateral (a Special Firm Collateral Realization ), the remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in
connection with an Excess Holdback) is insufficient to cover any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Holdback (when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided herein i.e. , cash contributed to the Trust
Account or an L/C in the Trust Account)), then up to 100 of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral that
consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to
be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner. To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such Partner s or
Withdrawn Partner s deficiency with respect to his or her Holdback in cash or an L/C. (B) Upon any valuation or
revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Partnership s books and records), if such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s
Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such Partner s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the Partnership s books and records, taking into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the
Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust
Account in an amount necessary to make up such deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his or her obligations under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that the first
sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) shall be deemed 
 34 

inapplicable to such default; provided further , that for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C): (I) the term GP-Related Defaulting Party where such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as defaulting party for purposes hereof and (II) the terms Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount and GP-Related Recontribution Amount where such terms appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C). (C) Upon a Partner becoming a Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the
General Partner may revoke the ability of such Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause
(C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn Partner s obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion
of the Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback). (D) Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner from using any amount of such Partner s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided , that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied. 
 Section 4.2. Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners capital related to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in any other investment
of the Partnership) shall be credited to the Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the General
Partner, at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the Partnership. 
 Section 4.3. Withdrawals of Capital . No Partner may withdraw capital related to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interests from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or
(iii) as determined by the General Partner. ARTICLE V 
 PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES 
 Section 5.1. General Accounting Matters . GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be determined
by the General Partner at the end of each accounting period and shall be allocated as described in Section 5.4. (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) means: (i) from any activity of the Partnership
related to the GP-Related BETP IV Interest for any accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related 
Investments described below), (x) the gross income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership, and all other items that are deductible from gross income, for such
accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined as provided below); 
 35 

(ii) from any GP-Related Investment
for any accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less (y) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment
(determined as provided below); and (iii) from any GP-Related Investment for the
accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment is sold or otherwise disposed of, (x) the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such
 GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting
period less (y) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment. (b) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be
determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the following adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxation and not
otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value in the books of the Partnership that differs from its
adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation, amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon an adjustment to the value of any asset in
the books of the Partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any
expenditures of the Partnership not deductible in computing taxable income or loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this
definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership employees in respect of phantom interests in such GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and (vi) items of income and expense (including interest income and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership, Holdings and other Affiliates of the Partnership shall be
allocated among the Partnership, Holdings and such Affiliates, among various Partnership activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner.
Any adjustments to GP-Related Net Income (Loss) by the General Partner, including adjustments for items of income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of expense accrued but not yet paid,
unrealized losses, reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) and other appropriate items shall be made in accordance with GAAP; provided , that the
General Partner shall not be required to make any such adjustment. 
 36 

(c) An accounting period shall be a Fiscal Year, except that, at the option of the General
Partner, an accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event
referred to in the preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period, then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to the Partners 
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs (prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or adjustments
to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners average GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting
period; provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
 GP-Related Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such GP-Related Investment was acquired. (d) In establishing
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate. (e) All determinations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting purposes under this
Agreement shall be made by the General Partner and approved by the Partnership s independent accountants. Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all Withdrawn
Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any
successor thereto. Section 5.2. GP-Related Capital Accounts . There shall be
established for each Partner in the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as may be appropriate, one or more capital accounts as the General Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for such Partner s
interests in the capital of the Partnership related to the GP-Related BETP IV Interest and the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a GP-Related Capital Account ). (a) As of the end of each accounting period or, in the case of a
contribution to the Partnership by one or more of the Partners with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by the Partnership to one or more of the Partners
with respect to such Partner or Partners GP-Related Partner Interests, at the time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate GP-Related 
Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited with the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the Partnership related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest during such accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and (C) the interest
credited on the balance of such Partner s capital related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be debited with the following amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in
Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any property distributed to such Partner during such accounting period with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest and
(y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated to such Partner for such accounting period. 
 37 

Section 5.3. GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages . Prior to the beginning of each annual accounting period, the General Partner shall establish the profit sharing percentage (the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of each
Partner in each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such annual accounting period pursuant to Section 5.1(a) taking into account such factors as the General Partner deems appropriate;
 provided , that (i) the General Partner may elect to establish GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment acquired by the Partnership during such accounting period at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired in accordance with paragraph (c) below
and (ii) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for such accounting period from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in accordance with the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in such GP-Related Investment established in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The General Partner may establish different GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages for any Partner in different categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). In the case of the Withdrawal of a Partner, such former
Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall be allocated by the General Partner to one or more of the remaining Partners as the General Partner shall determine. In the case of the admission of
any Partner to the Partnership as an additional Partner, the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of the other Partners shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage allocated to such new Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b); such reduction of each other Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentage shall be pro rata based upon such Partner s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as in effect immediately prior to the admission of the new Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
General Partner may also adjust the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of any Partner for any annual accounting period at the end of such annual accounting period in its sole discretion. 
 (a) The General Partner may elect to allocate to the Partners less than 100 of the GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages of any category for any annual accounting period at the time specified in Section 5.3(a) for the annual fixing of GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages (any remainder of such GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages being called a GP-Related Unallocated Percentage provided , that any
 GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in any category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any annual accounting period that is not allocated by the General Partner within 90
days after the end of such accounting period shall be deemed to be allocated among all the Partners (including the General Partner) in the manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
 (b) Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, (i) GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from any GP-Related Investment shall be allocated in proportion to the Partners respective GP-Related Capital Contributions in respect of such GP-Related Investment and (ii) GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from each GP-Related Investment shall be fixed at the time such GP-Related Investment is acquired and
shall not thereafter change, subject to any repurchase rights established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.7. 
 38 

Section 5.4. Allocations of GP-Related Net
Income (Loss) . Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), GP-Related Net Income of the Partnership for each GP-Related Investment shall be allocated to the GP-Related Capital Accounts related to such GP-Related Investment of all the Partners participating in such GP-Related Investment
(including the General Partner): first, in proportion to and to the extent of the amount of Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related 
Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest distributed to the Partners; second, to Partners that received Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of
 GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest in years prior to the years such GP-Related Net Income is being allocated to the extent such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest exceeded
 GP-Related Net Income allocated to such Partners in such earlier years; and third, to the Partners in the same manner that such Non-Carried Interest (other than amounts
representing a return of GP-Related Capital Contributions) or Carried Interest would have been distributed if cash were available to distribute with respect thereto. 
 (a) GP-Related Net Loss of the Partnership shall be allocated as follows: GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by BETP IV and allocated to the Partnership with respect to its pro rata share thereof (based on capital contributions made by the Partnership to BETP
IV with respect to the GP-Related BETP IV Interest) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with each Partner s Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentage
with respect to the GP-Related Investment giving rise to such loss suffered by BETP IV and (ii) GP-Related Net Loss relating to realized losses suffered by BETP IV
and allocated to the Partnership with respect to the Carried Interest shall be allocated in accordance with a Partner s (including a Withdrawn Partner s) Carried Interest Give Back Percentage (as of the date of such loss) (subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 5.8(e)). (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) above,
 GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest allocated after the allocation of a GP-Related Net Loss pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b) shall be
allocated in accordance with such Carried Interest Give Back Percentages until such time as the Partners have been allocated GP-Related Net Income relating to Carried Interest equal to the aggregate amount of GP-Related Net Loss previously allocated in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5.4(b). Withdrawn Partners shall remain Partners for purposes of allocating such
 GP-Related Net Loss with respect to Carried Interest. (c) To the extent the Partnership has any GP-Related Net Income (Loss) for any accounting period unrelated to BETP IV, such GP-Related Net Income (Loss) will be allocated in accordance with GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages prevailing at the beginning of such accounting period. (d) The
General Partner may authorize from time to time advances to Partners (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners who are also executive officers of Blackstone Inc. or any
Affiliate thereof) against their allocable shares of GP-Related Net Income (Loss). (e)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems
reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 39 

Section 5.5. Liability of Partners . Except as otherwise provided in the
Partnership Act or as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall be personally obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner solely by reason of being a Partner. In no event shall any Partner
or Withdrawn Partner (i) be obligated to make any capital contribution or payment to or on behalf of the Partnership or (ii) have any liability to return distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership, in each case except as
specifically provided in Section 4.1(d) or Section 5.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, as such Partner shall otherwise expressly agree in writing or as may be required by applicable law. 
 Section 5.6. [Intentionally omitted.] 
 Section 5.7. Repurchase Rights, etc . The General Partner may from time to time establish such repurchase rights and/or other
requirements with respect to the Partners GP-Related Partner Interests relating to GP-Related BETP IV Investments as the General Partner may determine. The General
Partner shall have authority to (a) withhold any distribution otherwise payable to any Partner until any such repurchase rights have lapsed or any such requirements have been satisfied, (b) pay any distribution to any Partner that is
Contingent as of the distribution date and require the refund of any portion of such distribution that is Contingent as of the Withdrawal Date of such Partner, (c) amend any previously established repurchase rights or other requirements from
time to time and (d) make such exceptions thereto as it may determine on a case by case basis. Section 5.8.
 Distributions . The Partnership shall make distributions of available cash (subject to reserves and other adjustments as provided herein) or other property to Partners with respect to such Partners 
 GP-Related Partner Interests at such times and in such amounts as are determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall, if it deems it appropriate, determine the availability for distribution of,
and distribute, cash or other property separately for each category of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) established pursuant to Section 5.1(a). Distributions of cash or other property with respect to Non-Carried Interest shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their respective Non-Carried Interest Sharing Percentages, and, subject to Section 4.1(d) and
Section 5.8(e), distributions of cash or other property with respect to Carried Interest shall be made among Partners in accordance with their respective Carried Interest Sharing Percentages. 
 (i) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by BETP IV of a portion of a GP-Related Investment is being considered by the Partnership (a GP-Related Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest with respect to such GP-Related Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate
 GP-Related Partner Interests, a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a
Partner s GP-Related Class B Interest ), and a GP-Related Partner Interest attributable to such
 GP-Related Investment excluding the GP-Related Disposable Investment (a Partner s GP-Related 
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by BETP IV) relating to a GP-Related Disposable Investment (with
respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class B Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class B
 
 40 

Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by BETP IV) relating to a GP-Related 
Investment excluding such GP-Related Disposable Investment (with respect to both Carried Interest and Non-Carried Interest) shall be made only to holders of GP-Related Class A Interests with respect to such GP-Related Investment in accordance with their respective GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentages relating to such GP-Related Class A Interests. Except as provided above, distributions of cash or other property with respect to each category of
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportions as the allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of each such category. 
 (b) Subject to the Partnership s having sufficient available cash in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, the Partnership shall
make cash distributions to each Partner with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership in an aggregate amount at least equal to the total U.S. federal, New York State and New York City income and other taxes that would be payable by such
Partner with respect to all categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner for such Fiscal Year, the amount of which shall be calculated (i) on the assumption that each Partner is an
individual subject to the then prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City and other income taxes (including, without limitation, taxes under Sections 1401 and 1411 of the Code), (ii) taking into account (x) the
limitations on the deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income) and (iii) taking into
account any differential in applicable rates due to the type and character of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocated to such Partner. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the General
Partner may refrain from making any distribution if, in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner, such distribution is prohibited by applicable law. 
 (c) The General Partner may provide that the GP-Related Partner Interest of any Partner or employee
(including such Partner s or employee s right to distributions and investments of the Partnership related thereto) may be subject to repurchase by the Partnership during such period as the General Partner shall determine (a
 Repurchase Period ). Any Contingent distributions from GP-Related Investments subject to repurchase rights will be withheld by the Partnership and will be distributed to the recipient thereof
(together with interest thereon at rates determined by the General Partner from time to time) as the recipient s rights to such distributions become Non-Contingent (by virtue of the expiration of the
applicable Repurchase Period or otherwise). The General Partner may elect in an individual case to have the Partnership distribute any Contingent distribution to the applicable recipient thereof irrespective of whether the applicable Repurchase
Period has lapsed. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership for any reason other than his or her death, Total Disability or Incompetence, the undistributed share of any GP-Related Investment that remains
Contingent as of the applicable Withdrawal Date shall be repurchased by the Partnership at a purchase price determined at such time by the General Partner. Unless determined otherwise by the General Partner, the repurchased portion thereof will be
allocated among the remaining Partners with interests in such GP-Related Investment in proportion to their respective percentage interests in such GP-Related Investment,
or if no other Partner has a percentage interest in such specific GP-Related Investment, to the General Partner; provided , that the General Partner may allocate the Withdrawn Partner s share of
unrealized investment income from a repurchased GP-Related Investment attributable to the period after the Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date on any basis it may determine, including to
 
 41 

existing or new Partners who did not previously have interests in such GP-Related Investment, except that, in any event, each Investor Special Partner
shall be allocated a share of such unrealized investment income equal to its respective GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage of such unrealized investment income. 
 (d) If Associates IV is obligated under the Clawback Provisions or Giveback Provisions to contribute to BETP IV a Clawback Amount or a Giveback
Amount (other than a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount) and the Partnership is obligated to contribute any such amount to Associates IV in respect of the Partnership s GP-Related Associates IV Interest
(the amount of any such obligation of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount being herein called a GP-Related Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such
amounts as are necessary to satisfy such obligations of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner,
such an amount of prior distributions by the Partnership (and the Other Fund GPs) with respect to Carried Interest (and/or Non-Carried Interest in the case of a
 GP-Related Giveback Amount) (the GP-Related Recontribution Amount which equals (I) the product of (a) a Partner s or Withdrawn
Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage and (b) the aggregate Clawback Amount payable by the Partnership in the case of Clawback Amounts and (II) with respect to a GP-Related Giveback
Amount, such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions of Carried Interest and/or Non-Carried Interest in connection with (a) the GP-Related BETP
IV Investment giving rise to the GP-Related Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (II)(a) above are insufficient to satisfy such
 GP-Related Giveback Amount, GP-Related BETP IV Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, but only those amounts received by the Partners with an
interest in the GP-Related BETP IV Investment referred to in clause (II)(a) above, and (c) if the GP-Related Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable BETP IV Agreement is unrelated to a specific GP-Related BETP IV Investment, all GP-Related BETP IV Investments. Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership, along with satisfying his
or her comparable obligations to the Other Fund GPs, if any, upon such call such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount, less the amount paid out of the Trust Account on
behalf of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner by the Trustee(s) pursuant to written instructions from the Partnership, or if applicable, any of the Other Fund GPs with respect to Carried Interest (and/or
 Non-Carried Interest in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts) (the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount ),
irrespective of the fact that the amounts in the Trust Account may be sufficient on an aggregate basis to satisfy the Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation under the Clawback Provisions and/or Giveback Provisions;
 provided , that to the extent a Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s share of the amount paid with respect to the Clawback Amount or the GP-Related Giveback Amount exceeds his or her GP-Related Recontribution Amount, such excess shall be repaid to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to clause (ii) below; provided further , that such
written instructions from the General Partner shall specify each Partner s and Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount. Prior to such time, the General Partner may, in its discretion
(but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Clawback Provisions or the Giveback Provisions will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate
amount of such obligations); provided further , that any amount from a Partner s Trust Account used to pay any GP-Related Giveback Amount (or such lesser amount as may be required by the
General Partner) shall be contributed by such Partner to such Partner s Trust Account no later than 30 days after the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount is paid with respect to such GP-Related Giveback Amount. 
 42 

(A) To the extent any Partner or Withdrawn Partner has satisfied any
Holdback obligation with Firm Collateral, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 10 days of the General Partner s call for GP-Related Recontribution Amounts, make a cash payment into the Trust
Account in an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback obligation satisfied with such Firm Collateral, or such lesser amount such that the amount in the Trust Account allocable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equals the sum of (I) such
Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Recontribution Amount and (II) any similar amounts payable to any of the Other Fund GPs. Immediately upon receipt of such cash, the Trustee(s) shall
take such steps as are necessary to release such Firm Collateral of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner equal to the amount of such cash payment. If the amount of such cash payment is less than the amount of Firm Collateral of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner, the balance of such Firm Collateral if any, shall be retained to secure the payment of GP-Related Deficiency Contributions, if any, and shall be fully released upon the satisfaction of the
Partnership s and the Other Fund GPs obligation to pay the Clawback Amount. The failure of any Partner or Withdrawn Partner to make a cash payment in accordance with this clause (B) (to the extent applicable) shall constitute a default
under Section 5.8(d)(ii) as if such cash payment hereunder constitutes a Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount under Section 5.8(d)(ii). Solely to the extent required by the BETP IV Partnership
Agreement, each partner of the General Partner shall have the same obligations as a Partner (which obligations shall be subject to the same limitations as the obligations of a Partner) under this Section 5.8(d)(i)(B) and under
Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) with respect to such partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount and solely to the extent that the Partnership has insufficient funds to meet the Partnership s obligations under the BETP IV Partnership
Agreement. (ii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner (a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net
 GP-Related Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Carried
Interest Give Back Percentages in the case of Clawback Amounts, and GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the case of GP-Related Giveback Amounts (as more fully
described in clause (II) of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) above)), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the GP-Related Defaulting Party s obligation to pay such
 GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount (a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment that the Partnership (or an Other Fund GP) will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such GP-Related Defaulting Party for payment of the
Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be, at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership, and the Other Fund GPs, if applicable, are permitted to pay the
Clawback Amount or GP-Related Giveback Amount, as the case may be; provided , that, subject to Section 5.8(e), no Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall as a result of such GP-Related Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount initially requested from
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in respect of such default. 
 43 

(A) Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith
judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the Partnership against the GP-Related Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not
ultimately reimbursed by the GP-Related Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right (effective upon such GP-Related Defaulting Party
becoming a GP-Related Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such GP-Related Defaulting Party s Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the GP-Related Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof (including amounts unrelated to
Carried Interest, such as returns of capital and profit thereon). Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner or Withdrawn Partner becoming a
 GP-Related Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or in the name of the General Partner, to take any actions which may be necessary to accomplish the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount of a GP-Related 
Defaulting Party from the date such Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 (B) Any Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s failure to make a GP-Related 
Deficiency Contribution shall cause such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to be a GP-Related Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. The Partnership shall first seek any remaining Trust Amounts (and Trust
Income thereon) allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to satisfy such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution before seeking cash
contributions from such Partner or Withdrawn Partner in satisfaction of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make a GP-Related Deficiency Contribution. 
 (iii) In the event any Partner or Withdrawn Partner initially fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share of any Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 5.8(d)(i)(A), the Partnership shall use its reasonable efforts to collect the amount which such Partner or Withdrawn Partner so fails to recontribute.
 
 44 

(iv) A Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s obligation to make
contributions to the Partnership under this Section 5.8(d) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. (e) The Partners
acknowledge that the General Partner will (and is hereby authorized to) take such steps as it deems appropriate, in its good faith judgment, to further the objective of providing for the fair and equitable treatment of all Partners, including by
allocating Aggregate Net Losses from Writedowns (as defined in the BETP IV Agreements) and Losses (as defined in the BETP IV Agreements) on GP-Related BETP IV Investments that have been the subject of a
writedown and/or Net Loss (as defined in the BETP IV Agreements) (each, a Loss Investment to those Partners who participated in such Loss Investments based on their Carried Interest Sharing Percentage therein to the extent that
such Partners receive or have received Carried Interest distributions from other GP-Related BETP IV Investments. Consequently and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, adjustments to Carried
Interest distributions shall be made as set forth in this Section 5.8(e). (i) At the time the Partnership is making
Carried Interest distributions in connection with a GP-Related BETP IV Investment (the Subject Investment that have been reduced under any BETP IV Agreement as a result of one or more Loss
Investments, the General Partner shall calculate amounts distributable to or due from each such Partner as follows: (A)
determine each Partner s share of each such Loss Investment based on his or her Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in each such Loss Investment (which may be zero) to the extent such Loss Investment has reduced the Carried Interest
distributions otherwise available for distribution to all Partners (indirectly through the Partnership from BETP IV) from the Subject Investment (such reduction, the Loss Amount 
 (B) determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions otherwise distributable to such Partner with respect to the Subject
Investment (indirectly through the Partnership from BETP IV) before any reduction in respect of the amount determined in clause (A) above (the Unadjusted Carried Interest Distributions and 
 (C) subtract (I) the Loss Amounts relating to all Loss Investments from (II) the Unadjusted Carried Interest
Distributions for such Partner, to determine the amount of Carried Interest distributions to actually be paid to such Partner Net Carried Interest Distribution ). 
 To the extent that the Net Carried Interest Distribution for a Partner as calculated in this clause (i) is a negative number, the General
Partner shall (I) notify such Partner, at or prior to the time such Carried Interest distributions are actually made to the Partners, of his or her obligation to recontribute to the Partnership prior Carried Interest distributions (a
 Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount ), up to the amount of such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution, and (II) to the extent amounts recontributed pursuant to clause (I) are insufficient to
satisfy such negative Net Carried Interest Distribution amount, reduce future Carried 
 45 

Interest distributions otherwise due such Partner, up to the amount of such remaining negative Net Carried Interest Distribution. If a Partner s (x) Net Carried Interest Distribution
Recontribution Amount exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of prior Carried Interest distributions less the amount of tax thereon, calculated based on the Assumed Tax Rate (as defined in the BETP IV Agreements) in effect in the Fiscal Years of such
distributions (the Excess Tax-Related Amount ), then such Partner may, in lieu of paying such Partner s Excess Tax-Related Amount, defer such
amounts as set forth below. Such deferred amount shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate. Such deferred amounts shall be reduced and repaid by the amount of Carried Interest otherwise distributable to such Partner in connection with future Carried
Interest distributions until such balance is reduced to zero. Any deferred amounts shall be payable in full upon the earlier of (i) such time as the Clawback Amount is determined (as provided herein) and (ii) such time as the Partner
becomes a Withdrawn Partner. To the extent there is an amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution with respect to a Partner
remaining after the application of this clause (i), notwithstanding clause (II) of the preceding paragraph, such remaining amount of negative Net Carried Interest Distribution shall be allocated to the other Partners pro rata based on
each of their Carried Interest Sharing Percentages in the Subject Investment. A Partner who fails to pay a Net Carried Interest
Distribution Recontribution Amount promptly upon notice from the General Partner (as provided above) shall be deemed a GP-Related Defaulting Party for all purposes hereof. 
 A Partner may satisfy in part any Net Carried Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount from cash that is then subject to a Holdback, to the
extent that the amounts that remain subject to a Holdback satisfy the Holdback requirements hereof as they relate to the reduced amount of aggregate Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner (taking into account any Net Carried
Interest Distribution Recontribution Amount contributed to the Partnership by such Partner). Any Net Carried Interest Distribution
Recontribution Amount contributed by a Partner, including amounts of cash subject to a Holdback as provided above, shall increase the amount available for distribution to the other Partners as Carried Interest distributions with respect to the
Subject Investment; provided , that any such amounts then subject to a Holdback may be so distributed to the other Partners to the extent a Partner receiving such distribution has satisfied the Holdback requirements with respect to such
distribution (taken together with the other Carried Interest distributions received by such Partner to date). (ii) In the
case of Clawback Amounts which are required to be contributed to the Partnership as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of the Partners with respect to any Clawback Amount shall be adjusted by the General Partner as follows: 
 (A) determine each Partner s share of any Net Losses (as defined in the BETP IV Agreements) in any GP-Related BETP IV Investments which gave rise to the Clawback Amount i.e. , the Losses that followed the last GP-Related BETP IV Investment with respect to which
Carried Interest distributions were made), based on such Partner s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage in such GP-Related BETP IV Investments; 
 46 

(B) determine each Partner s obligation with respect to the Clawback
Amount based on such Partner s Carried Interest Give Back Percentage as otherwise provided herein; and (C) subtract
the amount determined in clause (B) above from the amount determined in clause (A) above with respect to each Partner to determine the amount of adjustment to each Partner s share of the Clawback Amount (a Partner s
 Clawback Adjustment Amount ). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be decreased
by such Partner s Clawback Adjustment Amount, to the extent it is a negative number (except to the extent expressly provided below). A Partner s share of the Clawback Amount shall for all purposes hereof be increased by such Partner s
Clawback Adjustment Amount (to the extent it is a positive number); provided , that in no way shall a Partner s aggregate obligation to satisfy a Clawback Amount as a result of this clause (ii) exceed the aggregate Carried Interest
distributions received by such Partner. To the extent a positive Clawback Adjustment Amount remains after the application of this clause (ii) with respect to a Partner, such remaining Clawback Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to the
Partners (including any Partner whose Clawback Amount was increased pursuant to this clause (ii)) pro rata based on their Carried Interest Give Back Percentages (determined without regard to this clause (ii)). 
 Any distribution or contribution adjustments pursuant to this Section 5.8(e) by the General Partner shall be based on its good faith
judgment, and no Partner shall have any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any other Partners as a result of any adjustment made as set forth above. This Section 5.8(e) applies to all Partners, including Withdrawn Partners.
 It is agreed and acknowledged that this Section 5.8(e) is an agreement among the Partners and in no way modifies the obligations of
each Partner regarding the Clawback Amount as provided in the BETP IV Agreements. Section 5.9. Business Expenses . The
Partnership shall reimburse the Partners for reasonable travel, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses incurred by them in the conduct of the Partnership s business in accordance with rules and regulations established by the General Partner
from time to time. Section 5.10. Tax Capital Accounts; Tax Allocations . For U.S. federal income tax purposes, there shall be
established for each Partner a single capital account combining such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and GP-Related Capital Account, with such adjustments as the General Partner determines are appropriate so that such single
capital account is maintained in compliance with the principles and requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing and in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), the Partnership shall (i) determine and calculate separate allocations attributable to (A) the Carried Interest and any other distribution entitlements that are not commensurate with
capital contributed to the Partnership, and (B) any 
 47 

distribution entitlements of the Partners that are commensurate with capital contributed to (and gains reinvested in or retained by) the Partnership Capital Interest
Allocations ), (ii) determine and calculate Capital Interest Allocations in a similar manner with respect to capital contributed by each Partner, and (iii) consistently reflect each such allocation in its books and records, in each
case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3) (taking into account Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(iii) and as reasonably
determined by the General Partner). (a) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among
the Partners for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes in the same manner as such items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, except as may otherwise be provided
herein or by the Code or other applicable law. In the event there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any taxable year of the Partnership, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if
necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g) and
 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). In addition, this Agreement shall be
considered to contain a qualified income offset as provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion
shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are in accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. 
 (b) For U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes only, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or expense (or any item thereof) for
each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in a manner corresponding to the manner in which corresponding items are allocated among the Partners pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 5.10; provided , that the
General Partner may in its sole discretion make such allocations for tax purposes as it determines are appropriate so that allocations have substantial economic effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners, within the meaning of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. To the extent there is an adjustment by a taxing authority to any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership (or an adjustment to any Partner s distributive share
thereof), the General Partner may reallocate the adjusted items among each Partner or former Partner (as determined by the General Partner) in accordance with the final resolution of such audit adjustment.

 ADDITIONAL PARTNERS; WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERS; 
 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF 
 PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; TERMINATION 
 Section 6.1. Additional Partners . Effective on the first day of any month (or on such other date as shall be determined by the
General Partner in its sole discretion), the General Partner shall have the right to admit one or more additional or substitute persons into the Partnership as Limited Partners or Special Partners. Each such person shall make the representations and
certifications with respect to itself set forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7. The General Partner shall determine and negotiate with the additional Partner (which term shall include, without limitation, any substitute Partner) all terms
of such additional Partner s participation in the Partnership, including the additional Partner s initial GP-Related Capital Contribution, Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage. Each additional Partner shall have such voting rights as may be determined by the General Partner from time to time unless, upon
the admission to the Partnership of any Special Partner, the General Partner shall designate that such Special Partner shall not have such voting rights (any such Special Partner being called a Nonvoting Special Partner ). Any
additional Partner shall, as a condition to becoming a Partner, agree to become a party to, and be bound by the terms and conditions of, the Trust Agreement. If Blackstone or another or subsequent holder of an Investor Note approved by the General
Partner for purposes of this Section 6.1(a) shall foreclose upon a Limited Partner s Investor Note issued to finance such Limited Partner s purchase of his or her Capital Commitment Interests, Blackstone or such other or subsequent
holder shall succeed to such Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Interests and shall be deemed to have become a Limited Partner to such extent. Any additional Partner may have a GP-Related Partner
Interest or a Capital Commitment Partner Interest, without having the other such interest. (a) The
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other
Partners GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3. The Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, if any, to be
allocated to an additional Partner as of the date such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, together with the pro rata reduction in all other Partners Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages as of such date, shall be established by
the General Partner. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner is authorized, without the need for any further act, vote or consent of any person, to make adjustments to the
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages as it determines necessary in its sole discretion in connection with any additional Partners admitted to the Partnership, adjustments with respect to other Partners of the
Partnership and to give effect to other matters set forth herein, as applicable. (b) An additional Partner shall be required to contribute
to the Partnership his or her pro rata share of the Partnership s total capital, excluding capital in respect of GP-Related Investments and Capital Commitment Investments in which such Partner does not
acquire any interests, at such times and in such amounts as shall be determined by the General Partner in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 7.1. 
 (c) The admission of an additional Partner will be evidenced by (i) the execution of a counterpart copy of this Agreement by such
additional Partner, (ii) the execution of an amendment to this Agreement by the General Partner and the additional Partner, as determined by the General Partner, (iii) the execution by such additional Partner of any other writing
evidencing the intent of such person to become an additional Partner and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such writing being acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or (iv) the listing of such additional
Partner in the books and records of the Partnership by the General Partner. In addition, each additional Partner shall sign a counterpart copy of the Trust Agreement or any other writing evidencing the intent of such person to become a party to the
Trust Agreement that is acceptable to the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. 
 49 

Section 6.2. Withdrawal of Partners . Any Partner may Withdraw voluntarily from
the Partnership subject to the prior written consent of the General Partner, including if such Withdrawal would (i) cause the Partnership to be in default under any of its contractual obligations or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the
General Partner, have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or its business. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the General Partner generally intends to permit voluntary Withdrawals on the last day of any calendar month (or on such
other date as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), on not less than 15 days prior written notice by such Partner to the General Partner (or on such shorter notice period as may be mutually agreed upon between
such Partner and the General Partner); provided , that a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership
with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, and a Partner may Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest without Withdrawing from the Partnership with respect to
such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. (a) Upon the Withdrawal of any Partner, including
by the occurrence of any withdrawal event under the Partnership Act with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner, except as expressly provided herein. 
 (b) Upon the Total Disability of a Limited Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to such
person s GP-Related Partner Interest; provided , that the General Partner may elect to admit such Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership as a Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to such
person s GP-Related Partner Interest, with such GP-Related Partner Interest as the General Partner may determine. The determination of whether any Partner has
suffered a Total Disability shall be made by the General Partner in its sole discretion after consultation with a qualified medical doctor. In the absence of agreement between the General Partner and such Partner, each party shall nominate a
qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to Total Disability. (c) If
the General Partner determines that it shall be in the best interests of the Partnership for any Partner (including any Partner who has given notice of voluntary Withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (a) above) to Withdraw from the Partnership
(whether or not Cause exists) with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such Partner, upon written notice by
the General Partner to such Partner, shall be required to Withdraw with respect to such person s GP-Related Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest,
as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall be on or after the date of such notice. If the General Partner requires any Partner to Withdraw for Cause with respect to such person s GP-Related 
Partner Interest and/or with respect to such person s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, such notice shall state that it has been given for Cause and shall describe the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. 
 50 

(d) The Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner shall not, in and of itself, affect
the obligations of the other Partners to continue the Partnership during the remainder of its term. A Withdrawn General Partner shall remain liable for all obligations of the Partnership incurred while it was a General Partner and resulting from its
acts or omissions as a General Partner to the fullest extent provided by law. Section 6.3.
 GP-Related Partner Interests Not Transferable . No Partner may sell, assign, pledge, grant a security interest over or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest other than as permitted by written agreement between such Partner and the Partnership; provided , that this Section 6.3 shall not impair transfers by operation of law,
transfers by will or by other testamentary instrument occurring by virtue of the death or dissolution of a Partner, or transfers required by trust agreements; provided further , that, subject to the prior written consent of the General
Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Limited Partner may transfer, for estate planning purposes, up to 25 of his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage to any estate planning trust,
limited partnership, or limited liability company with respect to which a Limited Partner controls investments related to any interest in the Partnership held therein (an Estate Planning Vehicle ). Each Estate Planning Vehicle will
be a Nonvoting Special Partner. Such Limited Partner and the Nonvoting Special Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Limited Partner and such Nonvoting Special Partner with respect to the Partnership
(including the obligation to make additional GP-Related Capital Contributions), as the case may be. The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require any Estate Planning Vehicle to
Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of this Article VI. Except as provided in the second proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.3, no assignee, legatee, distributee, heir or transferee (by conveyance, operation of law or
otherwise) of the whole or any portion of any Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest shall have any right to be a Partner without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be
given or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any reason therefor). Notwithstanding the granting of a security interest in the entire Interest of any Partner, such Partner shall continue to be a Partner of the Partnership. 
 (a) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or transfer of any GP-Related Partner
Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 Section 6.4. Consequences upon Withdrawal of a Partner . Subject to the Partnership Act, the General Partner may not transfer or
assign its interest as a General Partner in the Partnership or its right to manage the affairs of the Partnership, except that the General Partner may, subject to the Partnership Act, with the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the
Partners, admit another person as an additional or substitute General Partner who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise);
 provided however , that the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, transfer all or part of its interest in the Partnership to a person who makes such representations with respect to itself as the General Partner deems necessary or
appropriate (with regard to compliance with applicable law or otherwise) and who owns, directly or indirectly, the principal part of the business then conducted by the General Partner in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or reorganization
of the General Partner, and, upon the assumption by such person of liability for all the obligations of the General Partner under this Agreement, such person shall be admitted as the General Partner. A person who is so admitted as an additional or
substitute General Partner shall thereby become a General Partner and shall have 
 51 

the right to manage the affairs of the Partnership and to vote as a Partner to the extent of the interest in the Partnership so acquired. The General Partner shall not cease to be the general
partner of the Partnership upon the collateral assignment of or the pledging or granting of a security interest in its entire Interest in the Partnership. 
 (a) Except as contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above, Withdrawal by a General Partner is not permitted. The Withdrawal of a Partner shall
not dissolve the Partnership if at the time of such Withdrawal there are one or more remaining Partners and any one or more of such remaining Partners continue the business of the Partnership (any and all such remaining Partners being hereby
authorized to continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution and hereby agreeing to do so). Notwithstanding Section 6.4(c), if upon the Withdrawal of a Partner there shall be no remaining Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be
dissolved and shall be wound up unless, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Withdrawal, all remaining Special Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of such
Withdrawal, of one or more Limited Partners. (b) The Partnership shall not be dissolved, in and of itself, by the Withdrawal of any
Partner, but shall continue with the surviving or remaining Partners as partners thereof in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 6.5. Satisfaction and Discharge of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest s . The terms of this Section 6.5 shall apply to the GP-Related Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, but, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5,
shall not apply to the Capital Commitment Partner Interest of a Withdrawn Partner. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term Settlement Date means the date as of which a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership is settled as determined under paragraph (b) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Limited Partner who Withdraws from the Partnership, and all or any portion
of whose GP-Related Partner Interest is retained as a Special Partner, shall be considered a Withdrawn Partner for all purposes hereof. 
 (a) Except where a later date for the settlement of a Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner
Interest in the Partnership may be agreed to by the General Partner and a Withdrawn Partner, a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date shall be his or her Withdrawal Date; provided , that if a Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date is not
the last day of a month, then the General Partner may elect for such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date to be the last day of the month in which his or her Withdrawal Date occurs. During the interval, if any, between a Withdrawn Partner s
Withdrawal Date and Settlement Date, such Withdrawn Partner shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to GP-Related Capital Contributions, interest on capital, allocations of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) and distributions as would have applied had such Withdrawn Partner remained a Partner of the Partnership during such period. 
 (b) In the event of the Withdrawal of a Partner, with respect to such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, the General Partner shall promptly after such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date (i) determine and allocate to the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts such Withdrawn Partner s allocable share of the GP-Related Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for the period ending on such Settlement Date
in accordance with Article V and (ii) credit the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts with interest in accordance with 
 52 

Section 5.2. In making the foregoing calculations, the General Partner shall be entitled to establish such reserves (including reserves for taxes, bad debts, unrealized losses, actual or
threatened litigation or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations) as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner in a particular case, a Withdrawn Partner shall not be entitled to receive any GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of the accounting period during which such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership (whether or not previously awarded or allocated) or any
 GP-Related Unallocated Percentage in respect of prior accounting periods that have not been paid or allocated (whether or not previously awarded) as of such Withdrawn Partner s Withdrawal Date. 
 (c) From and after the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner, the Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages shall, unless otherwise allocated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.3(a), be deemed to be GP-Related Unallocated
Percentages (except for GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages with respect to GP-Related Investments as provided in paragraph (f) below). 
 (d) Upon the Withdrawal from the Partnership of a Partner with respect to such Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest, such Withdrawn Partner thereafter shall not, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, have any rights of a Partner (including voting rights) with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 6.5, such Withdrawn Partner shall not have any interest in the Partnership s GP-Related Net Income (Loss), or in distributions related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest, GP-Related Investments or
other assets related to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If a Partner Withdraws from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest for any reason other than for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2, then the Withdrawn Partner shall be entitled to receive, at the time or times specified in Section 6.5(i) below, in satisfaction and discharge in full of the
Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, (x) payment equal to the aggregate credit balance, if any, as of the Settlement Date of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Accounts, (excluding any GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to any GP-Related Investment)
and (y) the Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest attributable to each GP-Related Investment in which the Withdrawn Partner has an interest as of the Settlement Date as provided in
paragraph (f) below (which shall be settled in accordance with paragraph (f) below), subject to all the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) above is an
aggregate negative balance, the Withdrawn Partner shall pay the amount thereof to the Partnership upon demand by the General Partner on or after the date of the statement referred to in Section 6.5(i) below; provided , that if the
Withdrawn Partner was solely a Special Partner on his or her Withdrawal Date, such payment shall be required only to the extent of any amounts payable to such Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5. Any aggregate negative balance in the
 GP-Related Capital Accounts of a Withdrawn Partner who was solely a Special Partner, upon the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in
the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall be allocated among the other Partners GP-Related Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
 GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in the categories of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) giving rise to such negative balance as determined by the General Partner as of
such Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. In the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership, no value shall be ascribed to goodwill, the Partnership name or
the anticipation of any value the Partnership or any successor thereto might have in the event the Partnership or any interest therein were to be sold in whole or in part. 
 53 

(i) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e), in the case
of a Partner whose Withdrawal with respect to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest resulted from such Partner s death or Incompetence, such Partner s estate or legal representative, as the
case may be, may elect, at the time described below, to receive a Nonvoting Special Partner GP-Related Partner Interest and retain such Partner s GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentage in all (but not less than all) illiquid investments of the Partnership in lieu of a cash payment (or Investor Note) in settlement of that portion of the Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related 
Partner Interest. The election referred to above shall be made within 60 days after the Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date, based on a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s
 GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5. (e) For purposes
of clause (y) of paragraph (e)(i) above, a Withdrawn Partner s percentage interest means his or her GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage as of the Settlement Date in the relevant GP-Related Investment. The Withdrawn Partner shall retain his or her percentage interest in such GP-Related Investment and shall retain his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to such GP-Related Investment, in which case such Withdrawn Partner (a Retaining Withdrawn
Partner shall become and remain a Special Partner for such purpose (and, if the General Partner so designates, such Special Partner shall be a Nonvoting Special Partner). The GP-Related Partner
Interest of a Retaining Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to GP-Related Partner Interests of any kind hereunder and such other terms
and conditions as are established by the General Partner. At the option of the General Partner in its sole discretion, the General Partner and the Retaining Withdrawn Partner may agree to have the Partnership acquire such GP-Related Partner Interest without the approval of the other Partners; provided , that the General Partner shall reflect in the books and records of the Partnership the terms of any acquisition pursuant to
this sentence. (f) The General Partner may elect, in lieu of payment in cash of any amount payable to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to
paragraph (e) above, to (i) have the Partnership issue to the Withdrawn Partner a subordinated promissory note and/or to (ii) distribute in kind to the Withdrawn Partner such Withdrawn Partner s pro rata share (as determined by
the General Partner) of any securities or other investments of the Partnership in relation to such Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest. If any securities or other investments are distributed in kind to
a Withdrawn Partner under this paragraph (g), the amount described in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(i) shall be reduced by the value of such distribution as valued on the latest balance sheet of the Partnership in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles or, if not appearing on such balance sheet, as reasonably determined by the General Partner. (g)
[Intentionally omitted.] 
 54 

(h) Within 120 days after each Settlement Date, the General Partner shall submit to the
Withdrawn Partner a statement of the settlement of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5 together with any cash payment, subordinated
promissory note and in kind distributions to be made to such Partner as shall be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall submit to the Withdrawn Partner supplemental statements with respect to additional amounts payable to or by
the Withdrawn Partner in respect of the settlement of his or her GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership e.g. , payments in respect of GP-Related 
Investments pursuant to paragraph (f) above or adjustments to reserves pursuant to paragraph (j) below) promptly after such amounts are determined by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such statements and the
valuations on which they are based shall be accepted by the Withdrawn Partner without examination of the accounting books and records of the Partnership or other inquiry. Any amounts payable by the Partnership to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this
Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in right of payment and subject to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring
prior to the applicable date of payment or distribution; provided , that such Withdrawn Partner shall otherwise rank pari passu in right of payment (x) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is
within one year before the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question and (y) with all persons who become Withdrawn Partners and whose Withdrawal Date is within one year after the Withdrawal Date of the Withdrawn Partner in question.
 (i) If the aggregate reserves established by the General Partner as of the Settlement Date in making the foregoing calculations should
prove, in the determination of the General Partner, to be excessive or inadequate, the General Partner may elect, but shall not be obligated, to pay the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate such excess, or to charge the Withdrawn Partner or his or
her estate such deficiency, as the case may be. (j) Any amounts owed by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership at any time on or after
the Settlement Date e.g. , outstanding Partnership loans or advances to such Withdrawn Partner) shall be offset against any amounts payable or distributable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner at any time on or after the Settlement
Date or shall be paid by the Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership, in each case as determined by the General Partner. All cash amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner to the Partnership under this Section 6.5 shall bear interest from the due
date to the date of payment at a floating rate equal to the lesser of (x) the Prime Rate or (y) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. The due date of amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to
Section 6.5(i) above shall be 120 days after a Withdrawn Partner s Settlement Date. The due date of amounts payable to or by a Withdrawn Partner in respect of GP-Related Investments for
which the Withdrawn Partner has retained a percentage interest in accordance with paragraph (f) above shall be 120 days after realization with respect to such GP-Related Investment. The due
date of any other amounts payable by a Withdrawn Partner shall be 60 days after the date such amounts are determined to be payable. 
 (k) At the time of the settlement of any Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.5, the General Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, impose any restrictions it deems appropriate on the assignment, pledge, grant of security interest, encumbrance or other
transfer by such Withdrawn Partner of any interest in any GP-Related Investment retained by such Withdrawn Partner, any securities or other investments distributed in kind to such Withdrawn Partner or such
Withdrawn Partner s right to any payment from the Partnership. 
 55 

(l) If a Partner is required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest for Cause pursuant to Section 6.2(d), then his or her GP-Related Partner Interest shall be settled in accordance with
paragraphs (a)-(r) of this Section 6.5; provided , that the General Partner may elect (but shall not be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: 
 (i) In settling the Withdrawn Partner s interest in any GP-Related Investment in
which he or she has an interest as of his or her Settlement Date, the General Partner may elect to (A) determine the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date and allocate to the appropriate GP-Related Capital Account of the Withdrawn Partner his or her allocable share of such GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) for purposes of calculating the aggregate balance of such Withdrawn Partner s GP-Related Capital Account pursuant to clause
(x) of paragraph (e)(i) above, (B) credit or debit, as applicable, the Withdrawn Partner with the balance of his or her GP-Related Capital Account or portion thereof attributable to each such GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date without giving effect to the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income (Loss) from such
 GP-Related Investment as of his or her Settlement Date, which shall be forfeited by the Withdrawn Partner or (C) apply the provisions of paragraph (f) above; provided , that the maximum amount
of GP-Related Net Income (Loss) allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to any GP-Related Investment shall equal such Partner s percentage interest of the GP-Related Unrealized Net Income, if any, attributable to such GP-Related Investment as of the Settlement Date (the balance of such
 GP-Related Net Income (Loss), if any, shall be allocated as determined by the General Partner). The Withdrawn Partner shall not have any continuing interest in any
 GP-Related Investment to the extent an election is made pursuant to (A) or (B) above. 
 (ii) Any amounts payable by the Partnership to the Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subordinate in
right of payment and subject to the prior payment in full of claims of all present or future creditors of the Partnership or any successor thereto arising out of matters occurring prior to or on or after the applicable date of payment or
distribution. (m) The payments to a Withdrawn Partner pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be conditioned on the compliance by such
Withdrawn Partner with any lawful and reasonable (under the circumstances) restrictions against engaging or investing in a business competitive with that of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates for a period not exceeding two
years determined by the General Partner. Upon written notice to the General Partner, any Withdrawn Partner who is subject to noncompetition restrictions established by the General Partner pursuant to this paragraph (n) may elect to forfeit the
principal amount payable in the final installment of his or her subordinated promissory note, together with interest to be accrued on such installment after the date of forfeiture, in lieu of being bound by such restrictions. 
 (n) In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to pay a Withdrawn Partner (other than the General Partner) a
discretionary additional payment in an amount and based upon such circumstances and conditions as it determines to be relevant. 
 56 

(o) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall apply to any Investor Special Partner
relating to a Limited Partner or Special Partner and to any transferee of any GP-Related Partner Interest of such Partner pursuant to Section 6.3 if such Partner Withdraws from the Partnership. 
 (p) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn
Partner s GP-Related Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate. 
 (i) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to
Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such
professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (q) Each Partner (other than the General Partner) hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent,
representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and
all agreements, instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which the General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 6.5, including,
without limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force
and effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 6.6. Dissolution of the Partnership . The General Partner may dissolve the Partnership prior to the expiration of
its term at any time on not less than 60 days notice of the dissolution date given to the other Partners. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.5. Section 6.7. Certain Tax Matters . The General Partner shall
determine all matters concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion. (a) The General
Partner shall cause to be prepared all federal, state and local tax returns of the Partnership for each year for which such returns are required to be filed and, after approval of such returns by the General Partner, shall cause such returns to be
timely filed. The General Partner shall determine the appropriate treatment of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership and the accounting methods and conventions under the tax laws of the United States, the several
States and other relevant jurisdictions as to the treatment of 
 57 

any such item or any other method or procedure related to the preparation of such tax returns. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to make or refrain from making any and all elections
permitted by such tax laws. Each Partner agrees that he or she shall not, unless he or she provides prior notice of such action to the Partnership, (i) treat, on his or her individual income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit relating to his or her interest in the Partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Partnership as reflected on the Form K-1 or other information statement
furnished by the Partnership to such Partner for use in preparing his or her income tax returns or (ii) file any claim for refund relating to any such item based on, or which would result in, such inconsistent treatment. In respect of an income
tax audit of any tax return of the Partnership, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership, or any administrative or
judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, (A) the Tax Matters Partner (as defined below) shall be authorized to act for, and his or her decision shall be
final and binding upon, the Partnership and all Partners except to the extent a Partner shall properly elect to be excluded from such proceeding pursuant to the Code, (B) all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in connection therewith
(including, without limitation, attorneys , accountants and other experts fees and disbursements) shall be expenses of the Partnership and (C) no Partner shall have the right to (1) participate in the audit of any
Partnership tax return, (2) file any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Partnership (unless he or she provides prior notice of such action
to the Partnership as provided above), (3) participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or
denial of such claim, or (4) appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund filed by the
Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings conducted by the Partnership or the Tax Matters Partner. The Partnership and each Partner hereby designate any Partner selected by the General Partner as
the partnership representative (as defined under the Code) (the Tax Matters Partner ). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and all other
Partners from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, deficiencies and expenses resulting from any breach or violation by such Partner of the provisions of this Section 6.7 and from all actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incident to any such breach or violation. 
 (b) Each individual Partner shall provide to the Partnership copies of each federal, state and local income tax return of such Partner
(including any amendment thereof) within 30 days after filing such return. (c) To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines
that the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership holds an interest) is or may be required by law to withhold or to make tax payments, including interest and penalties on such amounts, on behalf of or with respect to any Partner, or as a
result of a Partner s participation in the Partnership or as a result of a Partner s failure to provide requested tax information, including pursuant to Section 6225 or Section 1446(f) of the Code Tax
Advances ), the General Partner may withhold or escrow such amounts or make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner 
 58 

shall, at the option of the General Partner, (i) be promptly paid to the Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount
of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds upon dissolution of the Partnership
otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having
received all distributions (whether before or upon dissolution of the Partnership) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the
other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. The
obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(d) shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from the Partnership or any Transfer of a Partner s interest. 
 (e) To the extent that any taxes are imposed on the Partnership (or any entity in which the Partnership invests that is treated as a
flow-through entity for relevant tax purposes) with respect to income of the Partnership (or such entity) in lieu of taxes imposed directly on a Partner with respect to such income (including any state or local income taxes), whether by election of
the Partnership or the General Partner or otherwise, such amounts shall be deemed to have been distributed to such Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the
other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to any such tax payments. The obligations of a Partner set forth in this Section 6.7(e)
shall survive the Withdrawal of any Partner from the Partnership or any Transfer of a Partner s interest. Section 6.8.
 Special Basis Adjustments . In connection with any assignment or transfer of a Partnership interest permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner may cause the Partnership, on behalf of the Partners and at the time and in the
manner provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.754-1(b), to make an election to adjust the basis of the Partnership s property in the manner provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.
 ARTICLE VII CAPITAL
COMMITMENT INTERESTS; CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS 
 Section 7.1. Capital Commitment Interests, etc . This Article VII and Article VIII hereof set forth certain terms and conditions
with respect to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment BETP IV Interest and matters related to the Capital Commitment Partner Interests and the Capital Commitment BETP IV Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Article VII or in Article VIII, the terms and provisions of this Article VII and Article VIII shall not apply to the GP-Related Partner Interests or the
 GP-Related BETP IV Interest. 
 59 

(a) Each Partner, severally, agrees to make contributions of capital to the Partnership Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions as required to fund the Partnership s capital contributions to BETP IV or Associates IV in respect of the Capital Commitment BETP IV Interest, if any, and the related Capital
Commitment BETP IV Commitment, if any (including, without limitation, funding all or a portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment). No Partner shall be obligated to make Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership in an
amount in excess of such Partner s Capital Commitment-Related Commitment. The Commitment Agreements and SMD Agreements, if any, of the Partners may include provisions with respect to the foregoing matters. It is understood that a Partner will
not necessarily participate in each Capital Commitment Investment (which may include additional amounts invested in an existing Capital Commitment Investment) nor will a Partner necessarily have the same Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage
with respect to (i) the Partnership s portion of the Blackstone Capital Commitment or (ii) the making of each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner participates; provided , that this in no way limits the terms of
any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to give any Partner the right to obtain financing with respect to the purchase of any Capital Commitment Interest, and nothing contained herein shall
limit or dictate the terms upon which the Partnership and its Affiliates may provide such financing. The acquisition of a Capital Commitment Interest by a Partner shall be evidenced by receipt by the Partnership of funds equal to such Partner s
Capital Commitment-Related Commitment then due with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest and such appropriate documentation as the General Partner may submit to the Partners from time to time. 
 (b) The Partnership or one of its Affiliates (in such capacity, the Advancing Party may in its sole discretion advance to
any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners that are also executive officers of Blackstone) all or any portion of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions due to the Partnership from such Partner with respect to any Capital Commitment Investment Firm Advances ). Each such Partner shall pay interest to the Advancing Party on each Firm Advance from the date of such Firm
Advance until the repayment thereof by such Partner. Each Firm Advance shall be repayable in full, including accrued interest to the date of such repayment, upon prior written notice by the Advancing Party. The making and repayment of each Firm
Advance shall be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and such recording shall be conclusive evidence of each such Firm Advance, binding on the Partner and the Advancing Party absent manifest error. Except as provided below, the
interest rate applicable to a Firm Advance shall equal the cost of funds of the Advancing Party at the time of the making of such Firm Advance. The Advancing Party shall inform any Partner of such rate upon such Partner s request;
 provided , that such interest rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable by applicable law; provided further , that amounts that are otherwise payable to such Partner pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be used to repay
such Firm Advance (including interest thereon). The Advancing Party may, in its sole discretion, change the terms of Firm Advances (including the terms contained herein) and/or discontinue the making of Firm Advances; provided , that
(i) the Advancing Party shall notify the relevant Partners of any material changes to such terms and (ii) the interest rate applicable to such Firm Advances and overdue amounts thereon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowable
by applicable law. 
 60 

Section 7.2. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts . There shall be established for
each Partner in the books of the Partnership as of the date of formation of the Partnership, or such later date on which such Partner is admitted to the Partnership, and on each such other date as such Partner first acquires a Capital Commitment
Interest in a particular Capital Commitment Investment, a Capital Commitment Capital Account for each Capital Commitment Investment in which such Partner acquires a Capital Commitment Interest on such date. Each Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contribution of a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate Capital Commitment Capital Account of such Partner on the date such Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contribution is paid to the Partnership. Capital Commitment Capital Accounts shall
be adjusted to reflect any transfer of a Partner s interest in the Partnership related to his or her Capital Commitment Partner Interest as provided in this Agreement. 
 (a) A Partner shall not have any obligation to the Partnership or to any other Partner to restore any negative balance in the Capital
Commitment Capital Account of such Partner. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership with respect to a Capital Commitment Interest as a result of the disposition by the Partnership of the related Capital Commitment
Investment and in whole upon the dissolution of the Partnership, neither such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption except with the consent of the General Partner. 
 Section 7.3. Allocations . Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment Investment shall be
allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners (including the General Partner) participating in such Capital Commitment Investment in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
such Capital Commitment Investment. Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) on any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion which such Partner s aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear
to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; provided , that if any Partner makes the election provided for in Section 7.6, Capital Commitment Net Income (Loss) of the Partnership for each Capital Commitment
Investment shall be allocated to the related Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all the Partners participating in such Capital Commitment Investment who do not make such election in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentages for such Capital Commitment Investment. (a) Any special costs relating to distributions pursuant to Section 7.6
or Section 7.7 shall be specially allocated to the electing Partner. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make
such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose. 
 Section 7.4. Distributions . 
 Each Partner s allocable portion of Capital Commitment Net Income received from his or her Capital Commitment Investments, distributions
to such Partner that constitute returns of capital, and other Capital Commitment Net Income of the Partnership (including, without limitation, Capital Commitment Net Income attributable to Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests) during a Fiscal
Year of the Partnership will be credited to payment of the Investor Notes to the extent required below as of the last day of such Fiscal Year (or on such earlier 
 61 

date as related distributions are made in the sole discretion of the General Partner) with any cash amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to clauses (ii) and (vii) below to be
distributed within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or in each case on such earlier date as selected by the General Partner in its sole discretion) as follows (subject to Section 7.4(c) below): 
 (i) First, to the payment of interest then due on all Investor Notes (relating to Capital Commitment Investments or otherwise)
of such Partner (to the extent Capital Commitment Net Income and distributions or payments from Other Sources do not equal or exceed all interest payments due, the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes upon which interest is to be
paid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor); (ii) Second, to
distribution to the Partner of an amount equal to the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on income of the Partnership allocated to such Partner for such year in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest (the
aggregate amount of any such distribution shall be determined by the General Partner, subject to the limitation that the minimum aggregate amount of such distribution be the tax that would be payable if the taxable income of the Partnership related
to all Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests were all allocated to an individual subject to the then-prevailing maximum rate of U.S. federal, New York State and New York City taxes (including, without limitation, taxes imposed under
Section 1411 of the Code), taking into account the character of such taxable income allocated by the Partnership and the limitations on deductibility of expenses and other items for U.S. federal income tax purposes); provided, that additional
amounts shall be paid to the Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) to the extent that such amount reduces the amount otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to a comparable provision in any other BE Agreement and there are not sufficient
amounts to fully satisfy such provision from the relevant partnership or other entity; provided further, that amounts paid pursuant to the provisions in such other BE Agreements comparable to the immediately preceding proviso shall reduce those
amounts otherwise distributable to the Partner pursuant to provisions in such other BE Agreements that are comparable to this clause (ii); 
 (iii) Third, to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Investor Note financing (A) any Capital Commitment
Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year or (B) any BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year, to the extent not repaid from Other Sources; 
 (iv) Fourth, to the return to such Partner of (A) all Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions made in respect of
the Capital Commitment Interest to which any Capital Commitment Investment disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year relates or (B) all capital contributions made to any Blackstone Entity (other than the Partnership) in respect of
interests therein relating to BE Investments (other than Capital Commitment Investments) disposed of during or prior to such Fiscal Year (including all principal paid on the related Investor Notes), to the extent not repaid from amounts of Other
Sources (other than amounts of Capital Commitment Partner Carried Interest); 
 62 

(v) Fifth, to the payment of principal (including any previously deferred
amounts) then owing under all other Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid and the division of payments among such Investor Notes to be
determined by the Lender or Guarantor; (vi) Sixth, up to 50 of any Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after
application pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above shall be applied pro rata to prepayment of principal of all remaining Investor Notes of such Partner (including those unrelated to the Partnership), the selection of those of such
Partner s Investor Notes to be repaid, the division of payments among such Investor Notes and the percentage of remaining Capital Commitment Net Income to be applied thereto to be determined by the Lender or Guarantor; and 
 (vii) Seventh, to such Partner to the extent of any amount of Capital Commitment Net Income remaining after making the
distributions in clauses (i) through (vi) above, and such amount is not otherwise required to be applied to Investor Notes pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 To the extent there is a partial disposition of a Capital Commitment Investment or any other BE Investment, as applicable, the payments in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above shall be based on that portion of the Capital Commitment Investment or other BE Investment, as applicable, disposed of, and the principal amount and related interest payments of such Investor Note shall be adjusted
to reflect such partial payment so that there are equal payments over the remaining term of the related Investor Note. For a Partner who is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, distributions shall be made pursuant to
clauses (i) through (iii) above, and then, unless the Partnership or its Affiliate has exercised its rights pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, any remaining income or other distribution in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Investor Notes of such Partner, until all such Partner s Investor Notes have been repaid in full, with any such income or other distribution remaining thereafter distributed
to such Partner. Distributions of Capital Commitment Net Income may be made at any other time at the discretion of the General Partner.
At the General Partner s discretion, any amounts distributed to a Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest will be net of any interest and principal payable on his or her Investor Notes for the full period
in respect of which the distribution is made. (b) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (c) To the extent that the foregoing Partnership distributions and distributions and payments from Other Sources are insufficient to satisfy
any principal and/or interest due on Investor Notes, and to the extent that the General Partner in its sole discretion elects to apply this paragraph (c) to any individual payments due, such unpaid interest will be added to the remaining
principal amount of such Investor Notes and shall be payable on the next scheduled principal payment date (along with any deferred principal and any principal and interest due on such date); provided , that such deferral shall not apply to a
Partner that is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or its Affiliates. All unpaid interest on such Investor Notes shall accrue interest at the interest rate then in effect for such Investor Notes. 
 63 

(d) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 (e) The Capital Commitment Capital Account of each Partner shall be reduced by the amount of any distribution to such Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4(a). (f) At any time that a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a portion of a Capital Commitment Investment
is being considered by the Partnership or BETP IV (a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment ), at the election of the General Partner each Partner s Capital Commitment Interest with respect to such Capital Commitment
Investment shall be vertically divided into two separate Capital Commitment Interests, a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class B Interest ), and a Capital Commitment Interest attributable to such Capital Commitment Investment excluding the Capital Commitment Disposable Investment (a Partner s Capital Commitment
Class A Interest ). Distributions (including those resulting from a direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Disposable Investment shall be made
only to holders of Capital Commitment Class B Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment Class B
Interests, and distributions (including those resulting from the direct or indirect sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition by the Partnership) relating to a Capital Commitment Investment excluding such Capital Commitment Disposable Investment
shall be made only to holders of Capital Commitment Class A Interests with respect to such Capital Commitment Investment in accordance with their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages relating to such Capital Commitment
Class A Interests. (g) If (x) the Partnership is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute a Giveback Amount to BETP
IV in respect of any Capital Commitment BETP IV Interest that may be held by the Partnership or (y) Associates IV is obligated under the Giveback Provisions to contribute to BETP IV a Giveback Amount with respect to any Capital Commitment BETP
IV Interest that may be held by Associates IV and the Partnership is obligated to contribute any such amount to Associates IV in respect of the Partnership s Capital Commitment Associates IV Partner Interest (the amount of any such obligation
of the Partnership with respect to such a Giveback Amount in the case of either (x) or (y) being herein called a Capital Commitment Giveback Amount ), the General Partner shall call for such amounts as are necessary to satisfy
such obligation of the Partnership as determined by the General Partner, in which case, each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, in cash, when and as called by the General Partner, such an amount of prior distributions
by the Partnership with respect to the Capital Commitment BETP IV Interest (the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount which equals such Partner s pro rata share of prior distributions in connection with (a) the
Capital Commitment BETP IV Investment giving rise to the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, (b) if the amounts contributed pursuant to clause (a) above are insufficient to satisfy such Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, Capital
Commitment BETP IV Investments other than the one giving rise to such obligation, and (c) if the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount pursuant to an applicable BETP IV Agreement is unrelated to a specific Capital Commitment BETP IV
 
 64 

Investment, all Capital Commitment BETP IV Investments. Each Partner shall promptly contribute to the Partnership upon notice thereof such Partner s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount.
Prior to such time, the General Partner may, at the General Partner s discretion (but shall be under no obligation to), provide notice that in the General Partner s judgment, the potential obligations in respect of the Capital Commitment
Giveback Amount will probably materialize (and an estimate of the aggregate amount of such obligations). (i) In the event
any Partner (a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party fails to recontribute all or any portion of such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount for any reason, the General Partner shall
require all other Partners and Withdrawn Partners to contribute, on a pro rata basis (based on each of their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages), such amounts as are necessary to fulfill the Capital Commitment Defaulting
Party s obligation to pay such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount (a Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment
that the Partnership will be unable to collect such amount in cash from such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party for payment of the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount at least 20 Business Days prior to the latest date that the Partnership is
permitted to pay the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount; provided , that no Partner shall as a result of such Capital Commitment Deficiency Contribution be required to contribute an amount in excess of 150 of the amount of the Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount initially requested from such Partner in respect of such default. Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine in its good faith judgment that the Partnership should either (1) not attempt to collect such
amount in light of the costs associated therewith, the likelihood of recovery and any other factors considered relevant in the good faith judgment of the General Partner or (2) pursue any and all remedies (at law or equity) available to the
Partnership against the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, the cost of which shall be a Partnership expense to the extent not ultimately reimbursed by the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party. It is agreed that the Partnership shall have the right
(effective upon such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party) to set-off as appropriate and apply against such Capital Commitment Defaulting Party s Capital
Commitment Recontribution Amount any amounts otherwise payable to the Capital Commitment Defaulting Party by the Partnership or any Affiliate thereof. Each Partner hereby grants to the General Partner a security interest, effective upon such Partner
becoming a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party, in all accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment from the Partnership or any Affiliate of the Partnership and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of such security interest, the General
Partner may sell, collect or otherwise realize upon such collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Partner hereby appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful
 attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority, in the name of such Partner or in the name of the Partnership, to take any actions which may be necessary to
accomplish the intent of the immediately preceding sentence. The General Partner shall be entitled to collect interest on the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount of a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party from the date such Capital Commitment
Recontribution Amount was required to be contributed to the Partnership at a rate equal to the Default Interest Rate. 
 65 

(A) Any Partner s failure to make a Capital Commitment Deficiency
Contribution shall cause such Partner to be a Capital Commitment Defaulting Party with respect to such amount. (ii) A
Partner s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this Section 7.4(g) shall survive the termination of the Partnership. 
 Section 7.5. Valuations . Capital Commitment Investments shall be valued annually as of the end of each year (and at such other
times as deemed appropriate by the General Partner) in accordance with the principles utilized by Associates IV (or any other Affiliate of the Partnership that is a general partner of BETP IV) in valuing investments of BETP IV or, in the case of
investments not held by BETP IV, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, subject in each case to the second proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence. The value of any Capital Commitment Interest as of any date (the Capital
Commitment Value shall be based on the value of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment as set forth above; provided , that the Capital Commitment Value may be determined as of an earlier date if determined appropriate by the
General Partner in good faith; provided further , that such value may be adjusted by the General Partner to take into account factors relating solely to the value of a Capital Commitment Interest (as compared to the value of the
underlying Capital Commitment Investment), such as restrictions on transferability, the lack of a market for such Capital Commitment Interest and lack of control of the underlying Capital Commitment Investment. To the full extent permitted by
applicable law such valuations shall be final and binding on all Partners; provided further , that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to any Capital Commitment Interests held by a person who is or was at any time a direct
member or partner of a General Partner of the Partnership. Section 7.6. Disposition Election . At any time prior to the date
of the Partnership s execution of a definitive agreement to dispose of a Capital Commitment Investment, the General Partner may in its sole discretion permit a Partner to retain all or any portion of its pro rata share of such Capital
Commitment Investment (as measured by such Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment). If the General Partner so permits, such Partner shall instruct the General Partner in writing prior to
such date (i) not to dispose of all or any portion of such Partner s pro rata share of such Capital Commitment Investment (the Retained Portion and (ii) either to (A) distribute such Retained Portion to such
Partner on the closing date of such disposition or (B) retain such Retained Portion in the Partnership on behalf of such Partner until such time as such Partner shall instruct the General Partner upon 5 days notice to distribute such
Retained Portion to such Partner. Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall not be adjusted in any way to reflect the retention in the Partnership of such Retained Portion or the Partnership s disposition of other
Partners pro rata shares of such Capital Commitment Investment; provided, that such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon distribution of such Retained Portion to such Partner or upon distribution of
proceeds with respect to a subsequent disposition thereof by the Partnership. (a) No distribution of such Retained Portion shall occur
unless any Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with such distribution. 
 66 

Section 7.7. Capital Commitment Special Distribution Election . From time to time
during the term of this Agreement, the General Partner may in its sole discretion, upon receipt of a written request from a Partner, distribute to such Partner any portion of its pro rata share of a Capital Commitment Investment (as measured by such
Partner s Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage in such Capital Commitment Investment) (a Capital Commitment Special Distribution ). Such Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account shall be adjusted upon
distribution of such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. (a) No Capital Commitment Special Distributions shall occur unless any
Investor Notes relating thereto shall have been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with such Capital Commitment Special Distribution. 
 ARTICLE VIII WITHDRAWAL,
ADMISSION OF NEW PARTNERS Section 8.1. Partner Withdrawal; Repurchase of Capital Commitment Interests . Capital Commitment
Interests (or a portion thereof) that were financed by Investor Notes will be treated as Non-Contingent for purposes hereof based upon the proportion of (a) the sum of Capital Commitment-Related Capital
Contributions not financed by an Investor Note with respect to each Capital Commitment Interest and principal payments on the related Investor Note to (b) the sum of the Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions not financed by an
Investor Note with respect to such Capital Commitment Interest, the original principal amount of such Investor Note and all deferred amounts of interest which from time to time comprise part of the principal amount of the Investor Note. A Partner
may prepay a portion of any outstanding principal on the Investor Notes; provided , that in the event that a Partner prepays all or any portion of the principal amount of the Investor Notes within nine months prior to the date on which such
Partner is no longer an employee or officer of Holdings or an Affiliate thereof, the Partnership (or its designee) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase the Capital Commitment Interest that became
 Non-Contingent as a result of such prepayment; provided further , that the purchase price for such Capital Commitment Interest shall be determined in accordance with the determination of the
purchase price of a Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as set forth in paragraph (b) below. Prepayments made by a Partner shall apply pro rata against all of such Partner s Investor Notes; provided , that
such Partner may request that such prepayments be applied only to Investor Notes related to BE Investments that are related to one or more Blackstone Entities specified by such Partner. Except as expressly provided herein, Capital Commitment
Interests that were not financed in any respect with Investor Notes shall be treated as Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 (a) Upon a Partner ceasing to be an officer or employee of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, other than as a result of such Partner
dying or suffering a Total Disability, such Partner and the Partnership or any other person designated by the General Partner shall each have the right (exercisable by the Withdrawn Partner within 30 days and by the Partnership or its designee(s)
within 45 days after such Partner s ceasing to be such an officer or employee) or any time thereafter, upon 30 days notice, but not the obligation, to require the Partnership (subject to the prior consent of the General Partner, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to the Partnership Act, to buy (in the case of exercise of such right by such Withdrawn Partner) or the Withdrawn Partner to sell (in the case of exercise of such right by the Partnership
or its designee(s)) all (but not less than all) such Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. 
 67 

(i) The purchase price for each such Contingent Capital Commitment Interest
shall be an amount equal to (A) the outstanding principal amount of the related Investor Note plus accrued interest thereon to the date of purchase (such portion of the purchase price to be paid in cash) and (B) an additional amount (the
 Adjustment Amount equal to (x) all interest paid by the Partner on the portion of the principal amount of such Investor Note(s) relating to the portion of the related Capital Commitment Interest remaining Contingent and to
be repurchased, plus (y) all Capital Commitment Net Losses allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on such Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest, minus (z) all Capital Commitment Net Income allocated to the Withdrawn Partner on
the Contingent portion of such Capital Commitment Interest; provided , that, if the Withdrawn Partner was terminated from employment or his or her position as an officer for Cause, all amounts referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the
Adjustment Amount, in the General Partner s sole discretion, may be deemed to equal zero. The Adjustment Amount shall, if positive, be payable by the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interests to the Withdrawn Partner from the next
Capital Commitment Net Income received by such holders on the Contingent portion of such Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received. If the Adjustment Amount is negative, it shall
be payable to the holders of the purchased Capital Commitment Interest by the Withdrawn Partner (A) from the next Capital Commitment Net Income on the Non-Contingent portion of the Withdrawn
Partner s Capital Commitment Interests at the time such Capital Commitment Net Income is received by the Withdrawn Partner, or (B) if the Partnership or its designee(s) elect to purchase such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, in cash by the Withdrawn Partner at the time of such purchase; provided , that the Partnership and its Affiliates may offset any amounts otherwise owing to a
Withdrawn Partner against any Adjustment Amount owed by such Withdrawn Partner. Until so paid, such remaining Adjustment Amount will not itself bear interest. At the time of such purchase of the Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment
Interests, his or her related Investor Note shall be payable in full. (ii) Upon such Partner ceasing to be such an officer
or employee, all Investor Notes shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity (whether or not the Withdrawn Partner or the Partnership or its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of the
Withdrawn Partner s Contingent Capital Commitment Interests). (iii) If neither the Withdrawn Partner nor the
Partnership nor its designee(s) exercises the right to require repurchase of such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, then the Withdrawn Partner shall retain the Contingent portion of his or her Capital Commitment Interests and the Investor
Notes shall remain outstanding, shall become fully recourse to the Withdrawn Partner in his or her individual capacity, shall be payable in accordance with their remaining original maturity schedules and shall be prepayable at any time by the
Withdrawn Partner at his or her option, and the Partnership shall apply such prepayments against outstanding Investor Notes on a pro rata basis. 
 68 

(iv) To the extent that another Partner purchases a portion of a Capital
Commitment Interest of a Withdrawn Partner, the purchasing Partner s Capital Commitment Capital Account and Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentage for such Capital Commitment Investment shall be correspondingly increased. 
 (b) Upon the occurrence of a Final Event with respect to any Partner, such Partner shall thereupon cease to be a Partner with respect to such
Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. If such a Final Event shall occur, no Successor in Interest to any such Partner shall for any purpose hereof become or be deemed to become a Partner. The sole right, as against the Partnership and
the remaining Partners, acquired hereunder by, or resulting hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to any Partner shall be to receive any distributions and allocations with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest pursuant
to Article VII and this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Partnership to purchase the Capital Commitment Interests of such former Partner pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)), to the extent, at the time, in the manner and
in the amount otherwise payable to such Partner had such a Final Event not occurred, and no other right shall be acquired hereunder by, or shall result hereunder to, a Successor in Interest to such Partner, whether by operation of law or otherwise
and the Partnership shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder. Until distribution of any such Partner s interest in the Partnership upon
the dissolution of the Partnership as provided in Section 9.2, neither his or her Capital Commitment Capital Accounts nor any part thereof shall be subject to withdrawal or redemption without the consent of the General Partner. The General
Partner shall be entitled to treat any Successor in Interest to such Partner as the only person entitled to receive distributions and allocations hereunder with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest. 
 (c) If a Partner dies or suffers a Total Disability, all Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner shall be purchased by the
Partnership or its designee (within 30 days of the first date on which the Partnership knows or has reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability) (and the purchase price for such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall be
determined in accordance with Section 8.1(b) (except that any Adjustment Amount shall be payable by or to such Partner s estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in cash)), and any Investor Notes financing such
Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall thereupon be prepaid as provided in Section 8.1(b). Upon such Partner s death or Total Disability, any Investor Note(s) financing such Contingent Capital Commitment Interests shall become fully
recourse. In addition, in the case of the death or Total Disability of a Partner, if the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, so requests in writing within 180 days after the Partner s death or ceasing
to be an employee or member (directly or indirectly) of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates by reason of Total Disability (such requests shall not exceed one per calendar year), the Partnership or its designee may but is not obligated to
purchase for cash all (but not less than all) Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests of such Partner as of the last day of the Partnership s then current Fiscal Year at a price equal to the Capital
Commitment Value thereof as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase. Each Partner shall be required to include appropriate provisions in his or her will to reflect such provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership
may, in the sole discretion of the 
 69 

General Partner, upon notice to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest of such Partner, within 30 days of the first date on which the General Partner knows or has
reason to know of such Partner s death or Total Disability, determine either (i) to distribute Securities or other property to the estate, personal representative or other Successor in Interest, in exchange for such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests as provided in Section 8.1(e) or (ii) to require sale of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests to the
Partnership or its designee as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion) for an amount in cash equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof. 
 (d) In lieu of retaining a Withdrawn Partner as a Partner with respect to any Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, by notice to such Withdrawn Partner within 45 days of his or her ceasing to be an employee or officer of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or at any time thereafter, upon
30 days written notice, determine (1) to distribute to such Withdrawn Partner the pro rata portion of the Securities or other property underlying such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital
Commitment Interests, subject to any restrictions on distributions associated with the Securities or other property, in satisfaction of his or her Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests in the Partnership
or (2) to cause, as of the last day of any Fiscal Year of the Partnership (or earlier period, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion), the Partnership or another person designated by the General Partner (who may be itself
another Partner or another Affiliate of the Partnership) to purchase all (but not less than all) of such Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests for a price equal to the Capital
Commitment Value thereof (determined in good faith by the General Partner as of the most recent valuation prior to the date of purchase). The General Partner shall condition any distribution or purchase of voting Securities pursuant to paragraph
(d) above or this paragraph (e) upon the Withdrawn Partner s execution and delivery to the Partnership of an appropriate irrevocable proxy, in favor of the General Partner or its nominee, relating to such Securities. 
 (e) The Partnership may subsequently transfer any Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof which is purchased by it as
described above to any other person approved by the General Partner. In connection with such purchase or transfer or the purchase of a Capital Commitment Interest or portion thereof by the General Partner s designee(s), Holdings may loan all or
a portion of the purchase price of the transferred or purchased Capital Commitment Interest to the Partnership, the transferee or the designee-purchaser(s), as applicable (excluding any of the foregoing who is
an executive officer of Blackstone Inc. or any Affiliate thereof). To the extent that a Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Interests (or portions thereof) are repurchased by the Partnership and not transferred to or purchased by another
person, all or any portion of such repurchased Capital Commitment Interests may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be allocated to each Partner already participating in the Capital Commitment Investment to which the repurchased
Capital Commitment Interest relates, (ii) be allocated to each Partner in the Partnership, whether or not already participating in such Capital Commitment Investment, and/or (iii) continue to be held by the Partnership itself as an
unallocated Capital Commitment Investment (such Capital Commitment Interests being herein called Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests ). To the extent that a Capital Commitment Interest is allocated to Partners as provided in
clause (i) and/or (ii) above, any indebtedness incurred by the Partnership to finance such repurchase shall also be allocated to such Partners. All such Capital Commitment Interests allocated to Partners shall be deemed to be Contingent
and shall become 
 70 

Non-Contingent as and to the extent that the principal amount of such related indebtedness is repaid. The Partners receiving such allocations shall be
responsible for such related indebtedness only on a nonrecourse basis to the extent appropriate as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1 and except as such Partners and the General Partner shall otherwise
agree; provided , that such indebtedness shall become fully recourse to the extent and at the time provided in this Section 8.1. If the indebtedness financing such repurchased interests is not to be
 non-recourse or so limited, the Partnership may require an assumption by the Partners of such indebtedness on the terms thereof as a precondition to allocation of the related Capital Commitment Interests to
such Partners; provided , that a Partner shall not, except as set forth in his or her Investor Note(s), be obligated to accept any obligation that is personally recourse (except as provided in this Section 8.1), unless his or her prior
consent is obtained. So long as the Partnership itself retains the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall belong to the Partnership and any indebtedness
financing the Unallocated Capital Commitment Interests shall be an obligation of the Partnership to which all income of the Partnership is subject except as otherwise agreed by the lender of such indebtedness. Any Capital Commitment Net Income
(Loss) on an Unallocated Capital Commitment Interest shall be allocated to each Partner in the proportion his or her aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts bear to the aggregate Capital Commitment Capital Accounts of all Partners; debt
service on such related financing will be an expense of the Partnership allocable to all Partners in such proportions. (f) If a Partner is
required to Withdraw from the Partnership with respect to such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest for Cause, then his or her Capital Commitment Interest shall be settled in accordance with paragraphs
 (a)-(f) and (j) of this Section 8.1; provided , that if such Partner was not at any time a direct partner of a General Partner of the Partnership, the General Partner may elect (but shall not
be required) to apply any or all the following terms and conditions to such settlement: (i) purchase for cash all of such
Withdrawn Partner s Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests. The purchase price for each such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest shall be the lower of
(A) the original cost of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest or (B) an amount equal to the Capital Commitment Value thereof (determined as of the most recent valuation prior to the date
of the purchase of such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interest); (ii) allow
the Withdrawn Partner to retain such Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests; provided , that the maximum amount of Capital Commitment Net Income allocable to such Withdrawn Partner with respect to
any Capital Commitment Investment shall equal the amount of Capital Commitment Net Income that would have been allocated to such Withdrawn Partner if such Capital Commitment Investment had been sold as of the Settlement Date at the then prevailing
Capital Commitment Value thereof; or (iii) in lieu of cash, purchase such
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests by providing the Withdrawn Partner with a promissory note in the amount determined in (i) above. Such promissory note shall have a maximum term of ten
(10) years with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. 
 71 

(g) The Partnership will assist a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the
case may be, in the settlement of the Withdrawn Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest in the Partnership. Third party costs incurred by the Partnership in providing this assistance will be borne by the Withdrawn Partner or his or her
estate. (h) The General Partner may reasonably determine in good faith to retain outside professionals to provide the assistance to
Withdrawn Partners or their estates or guardians, as referred to above. In such instances, the General Partner will obtain the prior approval of a Withdrawn Partner or his or her estate or guardian, as the case may be, prior to engaging such
professionals. If the Withdrawn Partner (or his or her estate or guardian) declines to incur such costs, the General Partner will provide such reasonable assistance as and when it can so as not to interfere with the Partnership s day-to-day operating, financial, tax and other related responsibilities to the Partnership and the Partners. 
 (i) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and file, on behalf of such Partner, any and all agreements,
instruments, consents, ratifications, documents and certificates which such General Partner deems necessary or advisable in connection with any transaction or matter contemplated by or provided for in this Section 8.1, including, without
limitation, the performance of any obligation of such Partner or the Partnership or the exercise of any right of such Partner or the Partnership. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding the Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the death, disability or incapacity of such Partner. 
 Section 8.2. Transfer of Partner s Capital Commitment Interest . Except as otherwise agreed by the General
Partner, no Partner or former Partner shall have the right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest over, or otherwise dispose of or transfer Transfer all or part of any such Partner s Capital Commitment
Partner Interest in the Partnership; provided , that this Section 8.2 shall in no way impair (i) Transfers as permitted in Section 8.1 above, in the case of the purchase of a Withdrawn Partner s or Deceased or Totally
Disabled Partner s Capital Commitment Interests, (ii) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers by a Partner to another Partner of
 Non-Contingent Capital Commitment Interests, (iii) Transfers with the prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion without giving any
reason therefor) and (iv) with the prior written consent of the General Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Transfers of up to 25 of a Limited Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest to an Estate Planning Vehicle (it
being understood that it shall not be unreasonable for the General Partner to condition any Transfer of an Interest pursuant to this clause (iv) on the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or requirements imposed by the General Partner in
connection with any such Transfer, including, for example, a requirement that any transferee of an Interest hold such Interest as a passive, non-voting interest in the Partnership). The General Partner shall
designate that each Estate Planning Vehicle shall not have voting rights (any such Partner being called a Nonvoting Partner ). Such Partner shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of both such Partner and such
Nonvoting Partner with respect to the interest transferred (including the obligation to make additional Capital Commitment-Related Capital Contributions). The General Partner may at its sole option exercisable at any time require such Estate
Planning 
 72 

Vehicle to Withdraw from the Partnership on the terms of Section 8.1 and Article VI. No person acquiring an interest in the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall become a
Partner of the Partnership, or acquire such Partner s right to participate in the affairs of the Partnership, unless such person shall be admitted as a Partner pursuant to Section 6.1. A Partner shall not cease to be a Partner of the
Partnership upon the collateral assignment of, or the pledging or granting of a security interest in, its entire Interest in the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
 Section 8.3. Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no sale or Transfer of a Capital
Commitment Interest in the Partnership may be made except in compliance with all U.S. federal, state and other applicable laws, including U.S. federal and state securities laws. 
 ARTICLE IX DISSOLUTION 
 Section 9.1. Dissolution . The Partnership shall be dissolved and subsequently terminated: 
 (a) pursuant to Section 6.6; or 
 (b) upon the expiration of the term of the Partnership. 
 Section 9.2. Final Distribution . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, and following the payment of creditors of the
Partnership and the making of provisions for the payment of any contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the Partnership as required under the Partnership Act: 
 (a) The Partners respective interests in the Partnership shall be valued and settled in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 6.5 which provide for allocations to the GP-Related Capital Accounts of the Partners and distributions in accordance with the GP-Related Capital Account
balances of the Partners; and (b) With respect to each Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest, an amount shall be paid to such
Partner in cash or Securities in an amount equal to such Partner s respective Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for each Capital Commitment Investment; provided , that if the remaining assets relating to any Capital Commitment
Investment shall not be equal to or exceed the aggregate Capital Commitment Liquidating Shares for such Capital Commitment Investment, to each Partner in proportion to its Capital Commitment Liquidating Share for such Capital Commitment Investment;
and the remaining assets of the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests shall be paid to the Partners in cash or Securities in proportion to their respective Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages for
each Capital Commitment Investment from which such cash or Securities are derived. The General Partner shall be the liquidator. In the
event that the General Partner is unable to serve as liquidator, a liquidating trustee shall be chosen by the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Partners voting at a meeting of Partners (excluding Nonvoting Special Partners). 
 73 

Section 9.3. Amounts Reserved Related to Capital Commitment Partner Interests .
If there are any Securities or other property or other investments or securities related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests which, in the judgment of the liquidator, cannot be sold, or properly distributed in kind in the case
of dissolution, without sacrificing a significant portion of the value thereof, the value of a Partner s interest in each such Security or other investment or security may be excluded from the amount distributed to the Partners participating in
the related Capital Commitment Investment pursuant to Section 9.2(b). Any interest of a Partner, including his or her pro rata interest in any gains, losses or distributions, in Securities or other property or other investments or
securities so excluded shall not be paid or distributed until such time as the liquidator shall determine. (a) If there is any pending
transaction, contingent liability or claim by or against the Partnership related to the Partners Capital Commitment Partner Interests as to which the interest or obligation of any Partner therein cannot, in the judgment of the liquidator, be
then ascertained, the value thereof or probable loss therefrom may be deducted from the amount distributable to such Partner pursuant to Section 9.2(b). No amount shall be paid or charged to any such Partner on account of any such transaction
or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the liquidator shall determine. The Partnership may meanwhile retain from other sums due such Partner in respect of such Partner s Capital Commitment Partner Interest an amount which
the liquidator estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Partner in any probable loss or liability on account of such transaction or claim. 
 (b) Upon determination by the liquidator that circumstances no longer require the exclusion of any Securities or other property or retention of
sums as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.3, the liquidator shall, at the earliest practicable time, distribute as provided in Section 9.2(b) such sums or such Securities or other property or the proceeds realized
from the sale of such Securities or other property to each Partner from whom such sums or Securities or other property were withheld. 
 ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 
 Section 10.1. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably, including
any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including the
validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as any and all disputes arising out of, relating to or in connection with the termination, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership), whether arising during the existence
of the Partnership or at or after its termination or during or after the liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York U.S.A., in accordance with the
then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within 30 days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the International Chamber of
Commerce shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration proceedings. 
 74 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the General Partner may bring, or may
cause the Partnership to bring, on behalf of the General Partner or the Partnership or on behalf of one or more Partners, an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate,
seeking temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this
Section 10.1 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate,
and (iii) irrevocably appoints the General Partner as such Partner s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon any such agent, who shall promptly advise such
Partner of any such service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Partner in any such action or proceeding. 
 (b) EACH PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 10.1, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such
ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the forum(s)
designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties relationship with one another. 
 (i) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section 10.1 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible
to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. 5701 et seq .) (the Delaware Arbitration Act ). If, nevertheless, it shall be determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.1, including any rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act, or other applicable
law, such invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.1. In that case, this Section 10.1 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware
Arbitration Act or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.1 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 75 

Section 10.2. Ownership and Use of the Blackstone Name . The Partnership
acknowledges that Blackstone TM L.L.C. TM ), a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154 U.S.A., (or its successors or assigns) is the sole and exclusive
owner of the mark and name BLACKSTONE and that the ownership of, and the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of, the firm name or any abbreviation or modification thereof which consists of or includes BLACKSTONE, shall belong exclusively to TM,
which company (or its predecessors, successors or assigns) has licensed the Partnership to use BLACKSTONE in its name. The Partnership acknowledges that TM owns the service mark BLACKSTONE for various services and that the Partnership is using the
BLACKSTONE mark and name on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable basis in connection with its business and
authorized activities with the permission of TM. All services rendered by the Partnership under the BLACKSTONE mark and name will be rendered in a manner and with quality levels that are consistent with the high reputation heretofore developed for
the BLACKSTONE mark by TM and its Affiliates and licensees. The Partnership understands that TM may terminate its right to use BLACKSTONE at any time in TM s sole discretion by giving the Partnership written notice of termination. Promptly
following any such termination, the Partnership will take all steps necessary to change its partnership name to one which does not include BLACKSTONE or any confusingly similar term and cease all use of BLACKSTONE or any term confusingly similar
thereto as a service mark or otherwise. Section 10.3. Written Consent . Any action required or permitted to be taken by a vote
of Partners at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a Majority in Interest of the Partners consent thereto in writing. 
 Section 10.4. Letter Agreements; Schedules . The General Partner may, or may cause the Partnership to, enter or has previously
entered into separate letter agreements with individual Partners, officers or employees with respect to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages, Capital Commitment Profit Sharing Percentages, benefits or any
other matter, which letter agreements have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing, the terms of this Agreement with respect to any such Partner and such matters. The parties hereto agree that any rights established, or
any terms of this Agreement altered or supplemented, in any such separate letter agreement, including any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement, shall govern solely with respect to such Partner notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.
The General Partner may from time to time execute and deliver to the Partners schedules which set forth the then current capital balances, GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages and Capital Commitment Profit
Sharing Percentages of the Partners and any other matters deemed appropriate by the General Partner. Such schedules shall be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever;
 provided , that this in no way limits the effectiveness of any Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement. Section 10.5.
 Governing Law; Separability of Provisions . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. In particular, the Partnership has been
formed pursuant to the Partnership Act, and the rights and liabilities of the Partners shall be as provided therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, such provision shall
be given its meaning to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. 
 76 

Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3(a), inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective heirs and personal representatives, and any successor to a trustee of a trust which is or
becomes a party hereto; provided , that no person claiming by, through or under a Partner (whether such Partner s heir, personal representative or otherwise), as distinct from such Partner itself, shall have any rights as, or in respect
to, a Partner (including the right to approve or vote on any matter or to notice thereof) except the right to receive only those distributions expressly payable to such person pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII. Any Partner or Withdrawn Partner
shall remain liable for the obligations under this Agreement (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and any Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) of any transferee of all or any portion of
such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s interest in the Partnership, unless waived by the General Partner. The Partnership shall, if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment, based on the standards set forth in
Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) and Section 7.4(g)(ii)(A), to pursue such transferee, pursue payment (including any Net GP-Related Recontribution Amounts and/or Capital Commitment Recontribution Amounts) from
the transferee with respect to any such obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, on any person other than the Partners and their respective legal
representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent required by the BETP IV Agreements, (x) the limited partners in BETP IV shall be third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of
Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in paragraph 9.2.8(b) of the BETP IV Partnership Agreement), and
(y) the amendment of the provisions of Section 5.8(d)(i)(A) and Section 5.8(d)(ii)(A) (and the definitions relating thereto), solely as they relate to any Clawback Amount (for purpose of this sentence, as defined in paragraph 9.2.8(b)
of the BETP IV Partnership Agreement), shall be effective against such limited partners only with the 66 2/3 Combined Limited Partner Consent (as such term is used in the BETP IV Partnership Agreement) unless such amendment does not adversely
affect the LPs rights under paragraph 9.2.8 of the BETP IV Partnership Agreement. Section 10.7. Confidentiality . By
executing this Agreement, each Partner expressly agrees, at all times during the term of the Partnership and thereafter and whether or not at the time a Partner of the Partnership, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to any
person other than the Partnership, another Partner or a person designated by the Partnership, any information relating to the business, financial structure, financial position or financial results, clients or affairs of the Partnership that shall
not be generally known to the public or the securities industry, except as otherwise required by law or by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction; provided , that any
corporate Partner may disclose any such information it is required by law, rule, regulation or custom to disclose. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treasury Regulations
 Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), each Partner (and any employee, representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment and tax structure of the Partnership, it being understood and agreed, for this purpose, (1) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding (a) the Partners or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate
thereof) in any of the Partners, or (b) any investment or transaction entered into by the Partners; (2) any performance information relating to any of the Partners or their investments; and (3) any performance or other information relating
to previous funds or investments sponsored by any of the Partners, does not constitute such tax treatment or tax structure information. 
 77 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or impede any Partner from communicating,
cooperating or filing a complaint on possible violations of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation to or with any governmental agency or regulatory authority (collectively, a Governmental Entity ), including, but not
limited to, the SEC, FINRA, EEOC or NLRB, or from making other disclosures to any Governmental Entity that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation; provided , that in each case such
communications and disclosures are consistent with applicable law. Each Partner understands and acknowledges that (a) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any U.S. federal or state trade secret law for the
disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in confidence to a U.S. federal, state, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (ii) in a complaint
or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (b) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to
the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
Moreover, a Partner shall not be required to give prior notice to (or get prior authorization from) Blackstone regarding any such communication or disclosure. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or under applicable law, under no
circumstance is any Partner authorized to disclose any information covered by Blackstone or its affiliates attorney-client privilege or attorney work product or Blackstone s trade secrets without the prior written consent of Blackstone.
 Section 10.8. Notices . Whenever notice is required or permitted by this Agreement to be given, such notice shall be in
writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be given by hand delivery (including any courier service) or telecopy to any Partner at its address or telecopy number shown in the Partnership s books and records or, if given to the
General Partner, at the address or telecopy number of the Partnership in New York City. Each such notice shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon dispatch, and (ii) if given by hand delivery, when delivered to the address of such
Partner, the General Partner or the Partnership specified as aforesaid. Section 10.9. Counterparts . This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute a single instrument. For the avoidance of doubt, a person s execution and delivery of this Agreement by electronic signature
and electronic transmission (jointly, an Electronic Signature ), including via DocuSign or other similar method, shall constitute the execution and delivery of a counterpart of this Agreement by or on behalf of such person and
shall bind such person to the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement and any additional information incidental hereto may be maintained as electronic records. Any person executing and delivering this Agreement by an
Electronic Signature further agrees to take any and all reasonable additional actions, if any, evidencing its intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, as may be reasonably requested by the General Partner. 
 78 

Section 10.10. Power of Attorney . Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the
General Partner as such Partner s true and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, each acting alone, in such Partner s name, place and stead, to make,
execute, sign and file all instruments, documents and certificates which, from time to time, may be required to set forth any amendment to this Agreement or may be required by this Agreement or by the laws of the United States of America, the State
of Delaware or any other state in which the Partnership shall determine to do business, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, to execute, implement and continue the valid and subsisting existence of the Partnership. Such power of attorney
is coupled with an interest and shall survive and continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the subsequent Withdrawal from the Partnership of any Partner for any reason and shall not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity of
such Partner. Section 10.11. Partner s Will . Each Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall include in his or
her will a provision that addresses certain matters in respect of his or her obligations relating to the Partnership that is satisfactory to the General Partner and each such Partner and Withdrawn Partner shall confirm annually to the Partnership,
in writing, that such provision remains in his or her current will. Where applicable, any estate planning trust of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner to which a portion of such Partner s or Withdrawn Partner s Interest is transferred shall
include a provision substantially similar to such provision and the trustee of such trust shall confirm annually to the Partnership, in writing, that such provision or its substantial equivalent remains in such trust. In the event any Partner or
Withdrawn Partner fails to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.11 after the Partnership has notified such Partner or Withdrawn Partner of his or her failure to so comply and such failure to so comply is not cured within 30 days of
such notice, the Partnership may withhold any and all distributions to such Partner until the time at which such party complies with the requirements of this Section 10.11. 
 Section 10.12. Cumulative Remedies . Rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and do not preclude use of other
rights and remedies available under applicable law. Section 10.13. Legal Fees . Except as more specifically provided herein,
in the event of a legal dispute (including litigation, arbitration or mediation) between any Partner or Withdrawn Partner and the Partnership, arising in connection with any party seeking to enforce Section 4.1(d) or any other provision of this
Agreement relating to the Holdback, the Clawback Amount, the GP-Related Giveback Amount, the Capital Commitment Giveback Amount, the Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount
or the Capital Commitment Recontribution Amount, the losing party to such dispute shall promptly reimburse the victorious party for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute (such
determination to be made by the relevant adjudicator). Any amounts due under this Section 10.13 shall be paid within 30 days of the date upon which such amounts are due to be paid and such amounts remaining unpaid after such date shall accrue
interest at the Default Interest Rate. Section 10.14. Entire Agreement ; Modifications . This Agreement embodies
the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or
referred to herein. Subject to Section 10.4, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Except as provided herein, this Agreement may be amended or modified at any
time by the General Partner in its sole discretion, upon notification thereof to the Limited Partners. 
 79 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the day and
year first above written. In the event that it is impracticable to obtain the signature of any one or more of the Partners to this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding among the other Partners executing the same.

Exhibit 99.1 
 Section 13(r) Disclosure 
 Mundys S.p.A. (formerly Atlantia S.p.A. provided the disclosure reproduced below in connection
with activities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We have not independently verified or participated in the preparation of this disclosure. 
 Disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Funds
affiliated with Blackstone first invested in Mundys S.p.A. on November 18, 2022 in connection with the voluntary public tender offer by Schema Alfa S.p.A. for all of the shares of Mundys S.p.A., pursuant to which such funds obtained a
minority non-controlling interest in Mundys S.p.A. Mundys S.p.A. owns and controls Aeroporti di Roma S.p.A. ADR ), an operator of airports in Italy including Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport. Iran Air has historically operated
periodic flights to and from Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport as authorized, from time to time, by an aviation-related bilateral agreement between Italy and Iran, scheduled in compliance with European Regulation 95/93, and approved by the Italian
Civil Aviation Authority. ADR, as airport operator, is under a mandatory obligation to provide airport services to all air carriers (including Iran Air) authorized by the applicable Italian authority. The relevant turnover attributable to these
activities (whose consideration is calculated on the basis of general tariffs determined by such independent Italian authority) in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was less than
 100,000. Mundys S.p.A. does not track profits specifically attributable to these activities.
