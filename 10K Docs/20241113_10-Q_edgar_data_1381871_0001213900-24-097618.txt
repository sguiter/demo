The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to obtain adequate funding to support its operations
through continuing investments of debt and/or equity by qualified investors/creditors, internally generated working capital and monetization
of intellectual property assets. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as

- day guarantee that the candidate will not resign or be terminated in that time period. The
Company uses historical evidence as well as additional factors to determine and estimate the amount of consideration received that
the Company does not expect to be entitled to. For any amounts received for which the Company does not expect to be entitled, it
would not recognize revenue when the candidate is hired but would recognize those amounts received as a refund liability. The
Company included in the transaction price the estimated amount of variable consideration per the expected value method. A refund
liability would be credited for the difference between cash consideration received and variable consideration recognized. The refund
liability would be updated at the end of each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022
there was no refund liability on the consolidated balance sheets as historically no direct placement revenue has
been refunded to the Company.

The
acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the acquisition method under the guidance in ASC 805-10 and
805-20. This business combination was accounted for as a related party acquisition, as Neece is the chief product officer of the Company. 

Accordingly,
the total purchase consideration was allocated to net assets acquired based on their respective historical costs. The assets acquired,
and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business purchase combination be recognized at their historical costs as of the acquisition date.

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of

an aggregate of 2,000,000 in principal amount promissory notes that are to be due and payable two years from their issuance dates and
promissory notes with an aggregate of up to 270,000 that are to be due and payable six months from their issuance dates. The consummation
of the Merger Agreement has not been completed, due to our company s lack of capital. There is no assurance that we will be able
to obtain sufficient capital to do so. However, the owners of OWNverse remain, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, committed to
completing the Merger.

when we will obtain the capital needed to begin to generate revenues again. 

24 

Cost
of Revenue . Cost of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was 0 and 0, respectively. 

Compensation
Expense . Compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 250,000, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023,
when we reported compensation expense of 222,119. In both periods, compensation expense consisted entirely of compensation paid and
accrued to officers. 

Consulting
Expense . Consulting expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 0, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, when
consulting expenses was 60,000. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 61,606, compared to
 107,421 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the current period is attributable to our lack of operating capital. 

Professional
fees . Professional fees for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were 65,000, compared to 163,469 for the six months ended June
30, 2023. The decrease in professional fees is primarily due to our lower level of operations required by our lack of operating capital. 

Other
Income (Expense) . For the six months ended June 30, 2024, total other expense was 314,480, comprised exclusively of change in fair
value of derivative liability. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, total other expense was 99,553, comprised of change in the value
of derivative liabilities of 32,429 and interest expense of 497,405. 

Net
Income (Loss) . The Company reported a net loss of 691,086 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of 648,086
for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, we used 337,946 of cash in operating activities, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023,
when we used 88,378 of cash in operating activities. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, investing activities did not use or provide cash. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, financing activities provide 3434,155 of cash, compared to the for the six months ended June 30,
2023, when financing activities used 980 of cash. 

The
Company currently owes approximately 500,000 on non-convertible loans payable, all of which are in default, and approximately 450,000
for outstanding convertible notes, net of discounts, all of which are in default. 

In
addition, entities negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were eligible to apply for loans sponsored by the United States Small
Business Administration (SBA) Economic Injury Disaster Loan EIDL Loan program. On July 15, 2020, the Company received
cash proceeds of 40,400 under this program. In addition, in July 2020, the Company received 6,000 from the SBA as a COVID-19 Economic
Injury Disaster Loan Advance (the EIDL Advance ). The proceeds can be used to fund payroll, healthcare benefits, rent and
other qualifying expenses, and the loan is not subject to a loan forgiveness provision. The standard EIDL Loan repayment terms include
interest accruing at 3.75 per annum effective July 15, 2020; the payment schedule contains a one-year deferral period on initial principal
and interest payments; the loan term is thirty years; and there is no prepayment penalty or fees. The Company pledged all assets of the
Company as collateral for the loan. As of December 31, 2021, the amounts outstanding totaled 40,400, and was classified as part of notes
payable on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the Company entered into a security agreement with the SBA in which this promissory
note is collateralized by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. In addition, the Company s CEO, Edward Aizman, provided
his personal guaranty of the EIDL Loan and pledged certain of his personal assets in conjunction with his guaranty. On January 6, 2021,
the SBA announced a one-year extension of the deferral period for loans that commenced in 2020 delaying payments of principal and interest
to July 2022. Pursuant to an SBA Procedural Notice in December 2020, the EIDL Advance was forgiven. The Company has recognized the entire
EIDL Advance amount of 6,000 as grant income, which is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations
for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

25 

In
February 2022, the Company agreed to the first and second modifications of the EIDL Loan. The EIDL was modified to include additional
borrowings of 269,200, which were received in full in February 2022. Periodic monthly payments have increased to 1,556 in the first
modification and reduced to 1,506 in the second modification. Additionally, the Company entered into an amended security agreement with
the SBA in which this promissory note, and the modifications, is collateralized by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company.
The balance of the EIDL loan balance at December 31, 2023 is 309,500, respectively. The Company is in default under the EIDL Loan and
the EIDL Loan has been referred by the SBA to the U.S. Treasury Offset Program. The Company is currently in the process of addressing
the charged-off status of the EIDL Loan with the SBA and simultaneously submitting an application to the SBA s Hardship Accommodation
Program (HAP), whereby the Company hopes to receive some relief while arranging for, and keeping current, reduced payments thereon. There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to secure any such relief. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles which contemplate continuation of the Company on a going-concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that assets are realized,
and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. The
Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of (13,683,963). The Company s ability to
continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to obtain adequate funding to support its operations through continuing investments
of debt and/or equity by qualified investors/creditors, internally generated working capital and monetization of intellectual property
assets. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management
is currently pursuing a business strategy which includes raising the necessary funds to finance the Company s development and marketing
efforts. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Note 1 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation
of the Financial Statements. 

We
are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment
of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies.
An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to
determine whether such accruals should be adjusted. 

We
recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the
expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and
liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100 valuation allowance as management is unable
to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources and would be considered material to investors.

Not
applicable to smaller reporting companies.

4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation,
they concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024. 

The
following aspects of the Company were noted as potential material weaknesses: 

1. 
 We do not have written
 documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting
 is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the period ended June 30, 2024. Management
 evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our
 disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2. 
 We do not have sufficient
 resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company s ability to gather, analyze and properly review information
 related to financial reporting in a timely manner. As a result, as of the date of filing, we have not completed our ASC 606 implementation
 process and, thus, cannot disclose the quantitative impact of adoption on our financial statements. In addition, due to our size
 and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the
 extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate
 individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls
 and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

3. 
 We have inadequate controls
 to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial
 personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between
 non financial personnel and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded
 that the control deficiency represented a material weakness. 

4. 
 Certain control procedures
 were unable to be verified due to performance not being sufficiently documented. As an example, some procedures requiring review
 of certain reports could not be verified due to there being no written documentation of such review. Management evaluated the impact
 of its failure to maintain proper documentation of the review process on its assessment of its reporting controls and procedures
 and has concluded deficiencies represented a material weakness. 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no change occurred in the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item.
1. Legal Proceedings.

which we are a party, and, to our knowledge, there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, executive officers, or
