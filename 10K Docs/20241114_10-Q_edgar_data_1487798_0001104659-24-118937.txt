ECA MARCELLUS TRUST I 

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1. Organization of the Trust 

ECA Marcellus Trust I is a Delaware statutory trust
formed in March 2010 by Energy Corporation of America Legacy ECA to own royalty interests in 14 producing horizontal
natural gas wells producing from the Marcellus Shale formation, all of which are online and are located in Greene County, Pennsylvania
(the Producing Wells ), and royalty interests in 52 horizontal natural gas development wells subsequently drilled to the
Marcellus Shale formation (the PUD Wells within the Area of Mutual Interest , or AMI , comprising
approximately 9,300 acres held by Legacy ECA, of which it owned substantially all of the working interests, in Greene County, Pennsylvania.
The effective date of the Trust was April 1, 2010; consequently, the Trust received the proceeds of production attributable to the
PDP Royalty Interest (defined herein) from that date even though the PDP Royalty Interest was not conveyed to the Trust until the closing
of the initial public offering on July 7, 2010. The total number of units the Trust is authorized to issue is 17,605,000 units, all
of which are now common units. The royalty interests were conveyed from Legacy ECA s working interest in the Producing Wells and
the PUD Wells limited to the Marcellus Shale formation (the Underlying Properties ). In November 2017, Greylock Energy,
LLC and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries Greylock Energy ), including Greylock Production, LLC Greylock
Production ), which serves as operator of the subject wells, and Greylock Midstream, LLC Greylock Midstream ), whose
subsidiaries market and gather certain of the gas, acquired substantially of the assets of Legacy ECA, as described in Note 4. 

The royalty interest in the Producing Wells (the
 PDP Royalty Interest entitles the Trust to receive 90 of the proceeds (exclusive of any production or development costs
but after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of production of natural gas attributable to the Sponsor s
initial interest in the Producing Wells. The royalty interest in the PUD Wells (the PUD Royalty Interest and collectively
with the PDP Royalty Interest, the Royalty Interests entitles the Trust to receive 50 of the proceeds (exclusive of any
production or development costs but after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of production of natural
gas attributable to the Sponsor s initial interest in the PUD Wells. 

The Trust s cash receipts in respect of
the Royalty Interests are determined after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes associated with the Perpetual Royalty
Interests. The Trust s cash available for distribution is reduced by Trust administrative expenses. Post-production costs generally
consist of costs incurred to gather, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the natural gas produced. Charges (the
 Post-Production Services Fee payable to the Sponsor for such post-production costs on the Greene County Gathering System GCGS were limited to 0.52 per MMBtu gathered until Legacy ECA fulfilled its drilling obligation in 2011; since then, the
Sponsor has been permitted to increase the Post-Production Services Fee to the extent necessary to recover certain capital expenditures
in the GCGS. Additionally, if electric compression is utilized in lieu of gas as fuel in the compression process, the Trust will be charged
for the electric usage as provided for in the Trust conveyance documents. 

Gross proceeds to the Trust attributable to the
Royalty Interests during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 0.4 million and totaled approximately 2.1 million for
the four consecutive quarters ended September 30, 2024.The gross proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests are dependent upon both
the volume of hydrocarbons extracted and sold from the Underlying Properties and the price realized on those sales. The Trust has no control
or influence over either the volumes sold or the proceeds realized from those sales. The royalty income to which the Trust is entitled
has experienced a substantial decline beginning in late 2022, which has been driven by lower realized prices and, to a lesser extent,
volume declines that are primarily related to the natural production decline inherent in the Underlying Properties. Future volumes or
realized pricing or both may not be sufficient to maintain gross proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests over any four consecutive
quarters in excess of 1.5 million. 

The trust agreement provides that the Trust will
terminate if gross proceeds to the Trust attributable to the Royalty Interests over any four consecutive quarters are less than 1.5 million.
If this early termination event occurs, the trust agreement will require the Trustee to sell the Royalty Interests, either by private
sale or public auction, subject to Greylock Energy's right of first refusal to purchase the Royalty Interests. After the sale of
all of the Royalty Interests, payment of all Trust liabilities and establishment of reasonable provisions for the payment of additional
anticipated or contingent Trust expenses or liabilities, the Trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders. 

6 

The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of
substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting Trust administrative expenses, including the costs incurred as a result of being
a publicly traded entity, on or about the 60 th day following the completion of each quarter. Unless sooner terminated,
the Trust will begin to liquidate on or about March 31, 2030 (the Termination Date and will soon thereafter wind up
its affairs and terminate. At the termination of the Trust, 50 of each of the PDP Royalty Interest and the PUD Royalty Interest will
revert automatically to Greylock Production. The remaining 50 of each of the PDP Royalty Interest and the PUD Royalty Interest will be
sold, and the net proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the unitholders soon after the termination of the Trust. Greylock Production
will have a right of first refusal to purchase the remaining 50 of the Royalty Interests at the termination of the Trust. 

The business and affairs of the Trust are administered
by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee. Although Greylock Production operates all of the Producing Wells and all
of the PUD Wells, Greylock Production has no ability to manage or influence the management of the Trust. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee
has any authority or responsibility for, or any involvement with or influence over, any aspect of the operations on or relating to the
properties to which the Royalty Interests relate. 

NOTE 2. Basis of Presentation 

The preparation of financial statements
requires the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Without limiting the foregoing statement, the information furnished is based upon certain estimates of the
revenues attributable to the Trust from natural gas production for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and
is therefore subject to adjustment in future periods to reflect actual production for the periods presented. 

The information furnished reflects all normal and
recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Trustee, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period
presented. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The December 31,
2023 condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all applicable financial statement
disclosures. 

NOTE 3. Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying unaudited financial information
has been prepared by the Trustee in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. The financial statements of the Trust differ from
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP because certain cash reserves may be established for contingencies, which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Amortization of the investment in overriding royalty interests calculated on a unit-of-production basis is charged directly
to Trust Corpus. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as specified by Accounting Standard Codification ASC Topic
932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas: Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. Income determined on the basis of GAAP would include
all expenses incurred for the period presented. However, the Trust serves as a pass-through entity, with expenses for depreciation, depletion,
and amortization, interest and income taxes being based on the status and elections of the Trust unitholders. General and administrative
expenses, production taxes or any other allowable costs are charged to the Trust only when cash has been paid for those expenses. In addition,
the Royalty Interests are not burdened by field and lease operating expenses. Thus, the statement shows distributable income, defined
as income of the Trust available for distribution to the Trust unitholders before application of those additional expenses, if any, for
depreciation, depletion, and amortization, interest and income taxes. The revenues are presented net of existing royalties and overriding
royalties and have been reduced by gathering/post-production expenses. 

7 

Cash: 

Cash may include highly liquid instruments maturing
in three months or less from the date acquired. 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
Statements: 

The preparation of financial statements requires
the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue and Expenses: 

The Trust serves as a pass-through entity, with
items of depletion, interest income and expense, and income tax attributes being based upon the status and election of the unitholders.
Thus, the Statements of Distributable Income show Income available for distribution before application of those unitholders additional
expenses, if any, for depletion, interest income and expense, and income taxes. 

The Trust uses the accrual basis to recognize revenue,
with royalty income recorded as reserves are extracted from the Underlying Properties and sold. Expenses are recognized when paid. 

Royalty Interest in Gas Properties: 

The Royalty interest in gas properties is
assessed to determine whether the net capitalized cost is impaired, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its
carrying amount may not be recoverable, pursuant to ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. The Trust determines whether an
impairment charge is necessary to its investment in the Royalty interest in gas properties if total capitalized costs, less
accumulated amortization, exceed undiscounted future net revenues attributable to proved gas reserves of the Underlying Properties.
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves estimates of fair value, which is determined based on
discounted cash flow techniques using assumptions including projected revenues, future commodity prices, production costs, and
market-specific average cost of capital. Estimates of undiscounted future net revenues attributable to proved gas reserves utilize
estimates of future pricing, which are generally developed based on NYMEX forward pricing curves. If required, the Trust will
recognize an impairment charge to the extent that the net capitalized costs exceed the discounted fair value of the investment in
net profits interests attributable to proved gas reserves of the Underlying Properties. Any such impairment charge would not reduce
Distributable Income, although it would reduce Trust Corpus. No impairment in the Underlying Properties was recognized during 2023
or during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Significant dispositions or abandonment of the Underlying Properties
are charged to Royalty Interests and the Trust Corpus. 

Amortization of the Royalty interest in gas properties
is calculated on a units-of-production basis, whereby the Trust s cost basis in the properties is divided by Trust total proved
reserves to derive an amortization rate per reserve unit. Such amortization does not reduce Distributable Income, rather it is charged
directly to Trust Corpus. Revisions to estimated future units-of-production are treated on a prospective basis beginning on the date significant
revisions are known. 

The conveyance of the Royalty Interest to the Trust
was accounted for as a purchase transaction. The 352,100,000 reflected in the Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Trust Corpus as Royalty
interests in gas properties represents 17,605,000 Trust units valued at 20.00 per unit. The carrying value of the Trust s investment
in the Royalty Interests is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of such Royalty Interests. 

NOTE
4. Reaffirmation Agreement 

On November 29, 2017, Greylock Energy acquired
substantially all of the gas production and midstream assets of Legacy ECA, including Legacy ECA s interests in certain natural
gas properties that are subject to royalty interests held by the Trust. 

8 

In
connection with the transaction, Greylock Production assumed all of Legacy ECA s obligations under the Amended and Restated
Trust Agreement among the Trust, Legacy ECA and the Trustee (the Trust Agreement ), and other instruments to which Legacy
ECA and the Trustee were parties, including (1) the Administrative Services Agreement by and among Legacy ECA, the Trust and the
Trustee dated July 7, 2010, and (2) a letter agreement between Legacy ECA and the Trustee regarding certain loans to be made
by Legacy ECA to the Trust as necessary to enable the Trust to pay its liabilities as they become due (the Letter Agreement ).
In addition, Legacy ECA, Greylock Production, and the Trustee entered into a Reaffirmation and Amendment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases,
Security Agreement, Fixture Filing and Financing Statement (the Reaffirmation Agreement ), pursuant to which, among other
things, Greylock Production (1) reaffirmed the liens and the security interest granted pursuant to the existing mortgage securing
the interests in the subject properties, as well as the mortgage and the obligations of Legacy ECA under the mortgage, and (2) assumed
the obligations of Legacy ECA under the Letter Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts have been loaned to the Trust pursuant
to the Letter Agreement. 

NOTE 5. Income Taxes 

The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust, which
is taxed as a partnership for federal and state income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes has been made.
Uncertain tax positions are accounted for under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure,
and transition. The Trust has not identified any uncertain tax positions through the period ended September 30, 2024. 

NOTE 6. Related Party Transactions 

Trustee Administrative Fee: 

Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee
charges an annual administrative fee, subject to adjustment each year. The annual fee was 171,743 in 2023 and is 176,895 in 2024. The
Trust deducts these costs, as well as those to be paid to Greylock Production pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement referred
to below, in the period paid. 

Administrative Services Fee: 

The Trust and Greylock Production are parties to
an Administrative Services Agreement that obligates the Trust to pay Greylock Production an administrative services fee for accounting,
bookkeeping and informational services to be performed by Greylock Production on behalf of the Trust relating to the Royalty Interests.
The annual fee of 60,000 is payable in equal quarterly installments. Under certain circumstances, Greylock Production and the Trustee
each may terminate the Administrative Services Agreement at any time following delivery of notice no less than 90 days prior to the date
of termination.

Overview 

The
Trust is a statutory trust created under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. serves
as Trustee. The Trust does not conduct any operations or activities. The Trust s purpose is, in general, to hold the Royalty Interests
(described below), to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the Royalty Interests after payment
of Trust expenses, and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the Royalty Interests and the Trust units. The Trustee
has no authority or responsibility for, and no involvement with, any aspect of the oil and gas operations on the properties to which the
Royalty Interests relate. The Trust derives all or substantially all of its income and cash flows from the Royalty Interests. The
Trust is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. 

In
November 2017, Greylock Energy and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries , including Greylock Production, LLC, which serves
as operator of the subject wells, and Greylock Midstream, LLC, whose subsidiaries market and gather certain of the gas, acquired substantially
all of the gas production and midstream assets of Legacy ECA, including all of Legacy ECA s interests in certain natural gas properties
that are subject to royalty interests held by the Trust. 

In
connection with the transaction, Greylock Production assumed all of Legacy ECA s obligations under the Trust Agreement and
other instruments to which Legacy ECA and the Trustee were parties, including (1) the Administrative Services Agreement by and among
Legacy ECA, the Trust and the Trustee dated July 7, 2010, and (2) a letter agreement between Legacy ECA and the Trustee regarding
certain loans to be made by Legacy ECA to the Trust as necessary to enable the Trust to pay its liabilities as they become due (the Letter
Agreement ). In addition, Legacy ECA, Greylock Production, and the Trustee entered into a Reaffirmation and Amendment of Mortgage,
Assignment of Leases, Security Agreement, Fixture Filing and Financing Statement (the Reaffirmation Agreement ), pursuant
to which, among other things, Greylock Production (1) reaffirmed the liens and the security interest granted pursuant to the existing
mortgage securing the interests in the subject properties, as well as the mortgage and the obligations of Legacy ECA under the mortgage,
and (2) assumed the obligations of Legacy ECA under the Letter Agreement. 

The
Royalty Interests were conveyed to the Trust from the working interest now held by Greylock Production in the Producing Wells and the
PUD Wells limited to the Underlying Properties. The PDP Royalty Interest entitles the Trust to receive 90 of the proceeds (exclusive
of any production or development costs but after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of production
of natural gas attributable to the Sponsor s initial interest in the Producing Wells for a period of 20 years commencing
on April 1, 2010 and 45 thereafter. The PUD Royalty Interest entitles the Trust to receive 50 of the proceeds (exclusive of any
production or development costs but after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of production of natural
gas attributable to the Sponsor s initial interest in the PUD Wells for a period of 20 years commencing on April 1, 2010
and 25 thereafter. 

Legacy ECA was obligated
to drill all of the PUD Wells by March 31, 2014. As of November 30, 2011, Legacy ECA had fulfilled its drilling obligation to
the Trust by drilling 40 PUD Wells (52.06 Equivalent PUD Wells), calculated as provided in the Development Agreement. Consequently, no
additional wells will be drilled for the Trust. The Trust was not responsible for any costs related to the drilling of development wells
or any other development or operating costs. As of September 30, 2024, the Trust owns royalty interests in 14 Producing Wells and the
40 development wells (52.06 Equivalent PUD Wells) that are now completed and in production. 

11 

The
Trust s cash receipts in respect of the Royalty Interests are determined after deducting post-production costs and any
applicable taxes associated with the Royalty Interests, and the Trust s cash available for distribution is reduced by Trust
administrative expenses and any amounts reserved for administrative expenses. Post-production costs generally consist of
costs incurred to gather, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the natural gas produced. Charges (the
 Post-Production Services Fee payable to Legacy ECA for such post-production
costs on the related GCGS were limited to 0.52 per MMBtu gathered until Legacy ECA fulfilled its drilling obligation in 2011; since
then the Sponsor has been permitted to increase the Post-Production Services Fee to the extent necessary to recover certain capital
expenditures in the GCGS . 

Greylock Production has an agreement with Columbia
Gas Transmission, LLC Columbia to provide firm transportation downstream of the GCGS for 45,000 MMBtu per day (the
 Transportation Agreement ). The Transportation Agreement has been in effect since August 1, 2011 and provides for firm
transportation at Columbia s filed tariff rate, which is currently 0.3154 per MMBtu at one hundred percent load factor. During
the third quarter of 2024 Greylock Production and Columbia amended the Transportation Agreement to provide for firm transportation of
39,901 MMBtu per day through December 31, 2027. The rate under the Transportation Agreement was set in 2022 pursuant to a settlement between
Columbia and certain shippers in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and cannot be raised prior to April 1, 2025. 

On September 30, 2024 Columbia submitted an application to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to increase certain tariff rates effective April 1, 2025. FERC issued an Order
Accepting and Suspending Filing, Subject to Refund on October 31, 2024. The tariff filing is currently being protested at FERC. 
Once the rate case is settled, Columbia would be required to issue a refund on any difference between the proposed rate being applied
and the final tariff rate. 

Firm transportation utilized as to the Trust s
interests is a chargeable post-production cost, and the Trust bears its proportionate share of such costs; however, the Trust was not
charged for the costs associated with modifying the Transportation Agreement with Columbia. 

Greylock Production may enter into similar gas
supply arrangements and post-production service arrangements for the natural gas to be produced from the Underlying Properties. Any new
gas supply arrangements or those entered into for providing post-production services, will be utilized in determining the proceeds for
the Underlying Properties. Accordingly, to the extent that the cost of any new gas supply arrangements exceeds the cost under existing
arrangements, proceeds to the Trust could decline and any such decline could be material. 

Generally, the percentage
of production proceeds to be received by the Trust with respect to a well equals the product of (i) the percentage of proceeds to
which the Trust is entitled under the terms of the conveyances (90 for the Producing Wells and 50 for the PUD Wells) multiplied by (ii) Greylock
Production s net revenue interest in the well. Greylock Production on average owns an 81.53 net revenue interest in the Producing
Wells. Therefore, the Trust is entitled to receive on average 73.37 of the proceeds of production from the Producing Wells. With respect
to the PUD Wells, the conveyance related to the PUD Royalty Interest provides that the proceeds from the PUD Wells will be calculated
on the basis that the underlying PUD Wells are burdened only by interests that in total would not exceed 12.5 of the revenues from such
properties, regardless of whether the royalty interest owners are actually entitled to a greater percentage of revenues from such properties.
As an example, assuming Greylock Production owns a 100 working interest in a PUD Well, the applicable net revenue interest is calculated
by multiplying Greylock Production s percentage working interest in the 100 working interest well by the unburdened interest percentage
(87.5 ), and such well would have a minimum 87.5 net revenue interest. Accordingly, the Trust is entitled to a minimum of 43.75 of the
production proceeds from the well provided in this example. To the extent Greylock Production s working interest in a PUD Well is
less than 100 , the Trust s share of proceeds would be proportionately reduced. 

The Trust makes quarterly
cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting Trust administrative expenses and costs and reserves therefor,
on or about the 60 th day following the completion of each quarter. Unless sooner terminated, the Trust will begin to liquidate
in March 2030 and will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. 

12 

The amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions
to Trust unitholders depends on, among other things: 

natural gas prices received; 

the volume and Btu rating of natural gas produced and sold; 

post-production costs and any applicable taxes; and 

administrative expenses of the Trust including expenses incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity and any changes in
amounts reserved for such expenses. 

The markets for natural gas are volatile, as demonstrated by significant
price swings experienced during 2020 and 2021 attributable primarily to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the
gradual return of demand for natural gas as economies reopened. COVID-19 and the responses by federal, state and local governmental authorities
to the pandemic also resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions,
travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and limitations on the availability of workforces. Meanwhile, the outbreak of war between Russia
and Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent sanctions imposed on Russia and other actions have created significant market uncertainties,
including uncertainties around potential supply disruption for oil and natural gas, which has further enhanced the volatility in natural
gas prices since early 2022. The extent and duration of the war in Ukraine, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant,
including significant volatility in commodity prices, supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions,
political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage, each
of which could have a substantial impact on the global economy and consequently the Trust s business for an unknown period of time.
More recently, the current hostilities between Israel and Iran and its proxies amid increased tensions in the Middle East also could have a disruptive
effect on global natural gas markets. Although the events in Ukraine and the Middle East are not currently expected to have a material
impact on the Trust s business, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition, neither Greylock nor the Trustee can predict the progress
or outcome of the war in Ukraine or the armed conflict between Israel and Iran and its proxies, as these conflicts, and any resulting government reactions,
are evolving and beyond the control of Greylock or the Trust. Although the inflation rate has declined from the higher levels experienced
in 2022 and early 2023, the resulting increases in interest rates since the first quarter of 2022 and the prospect of a possible recession
in the near future also could have a negative effect on the demand for natural gas. Given the dynamic nature of these events, neither
Greylock Energy nor the Trust can reasonably estimate the period of time that these market conditions will persist. As a result, prices
for natural gas, and therefore the Trust s quarterly cash distributions, might not be maintained for any significant period. Low
natural gas prices will reduce revenues to the Trust, which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders and
in certain periods could result in no distributions to unitholders. For example, there was no distribution to unitholders for the quarter
ended June 30, 2024 as Trust expenses exceeded net revenues to the Trust. 

The effective date of the Trust was April 1,
2010, meaning the Trust has received the proceeds of production attributable to the PDP Royalty Interest from that date even though the
PDP Royalty Interest was not conveyed to the Trust until July 7, 2010. The amount of the quarterly distributions fluctuates from
quarter to quarter, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust, among other factors. There is no minimum required distribution. 

Gross proceeds to the Trust attributable to the
Royalty Interests during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 0.4 million and totaled approximately 2.1 million for
the four consecutive quarters ended September 30, 2024. The gross proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests are dependent upon both
the volume of hydrocarbons extracted and sold from the Underlying Properties and the price realized on those sales. The Trust has no control
or influence over either the volumes sold or the proceeds realized from those sales. The royalty income to which the Trust is entitled
has experienced a substantial decline beginning in late 2022, which has been driven by lower realized prices and, to a lesser extent,
volume declines that are primarily related to the natural production decline inherent in the Underlying Properties. Future volumes or
realized pricing or both may not be sufficient to maintain gross proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests over any four consecutive
quarters in excess of 1.5 million. 

13 

The trust agreement provides that the Trust will
terminate if gross proceeds to the Trust attributable to the Royalty Interests over any four consecutive quarters are less than 1.5 million.
If this early termination event occurs, the trust agreement will require the Trustee to sell the Royalty Interests, either by private
sale or public auction, subject to Greylock Energy's right of first refusal to purchase the Royalty Interests. After the sale of
all of the Royalty Interests, payment of all Trust liabilities and establishment of reasonable provisions for the payment of additional
anticipated or contingent Trust expenses or liabilities, the Trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders. 

Pursuant to Section 1446 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the IRC ), withholding tax on income effectively connected to a United States trade or business allocated to
non-U.S. persons ECI should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under IRC Section 1441, withholding tax on fixed,
determinable, annual, periodic income from United States sources allocated to non-U.S. persons should be made at a 30 rate unless the
rate is reduced by treaty. Nominees and brokers should withhold at the highest marginal rate on the distribution made to non-U.S. persons.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA enacted in December 2017 treats a non-U.S. holder s gain on the sale of
Trust units as ECI to the extent such holder would have had ECI if the Trust had sold all of its assets at fair market value on the date
of the sale of such Trust units. The TCJA also requires a transferee of units to withhold 10 of the amount realized on the sale of exchange
of units (generally, the purchase price) unless the transferor certifies that it is not a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation
or another exception is available. Pursuant to final Treasury Regulations issued on October 7, 2020, this withholding obligation
applies to transfers of units in publicly traded partnerships such as the Trust (which is classified as a partnership for federal and
state income tax purposes) occurring on or after January 1, 2022. 

Results of Trust Operations 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Distributable income for each of the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.1 million. Royalty income was 0.4 million for each of the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, and general and administrative expenses remained flat between periods. 

Royalty income was 0.4 million for each of the
three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Between periods, there was an increase in the average sales price realized which
was partially offset by a decrease in production. 

The average price realized for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.05 per Mcf to 0.88 per Mcf compared to 0.83 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase in the average sales price realized for natural gas production was due to a higher average sales price, partially offset
by an increase in other post-production costs. The average sales price, before post-production costs, increased from 1.46 per Mcf for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.53 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in price was the
result of an increase in the average Basis per MMBtu realized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to minus 0.69 per MMBtu compared
to minus 1.17 per MMBtu for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average monthly closing NYMEX price for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.15 per MMBtu compared to the weighted average monthly closing NYMEX price of 2.55 per MMBtu
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Post-production costs consist
of a post-production services fee together with a charge for electricity used in lieu of gas for compression on the gathering system and
firm transportation charges on interstate gas pipelines. Average post-production costs were 0.65 for the three months ended September
20, 2024 compared to 0.63 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

14 

Production decreased 13.7 from 545 MMcf for the
three months ended September 30, 2023 to 471 MMcf for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to normal declines as well as compressor
maintenance occurring on the GCGS during the current period. 

General and administrative
expenses paid by the Trust were 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Cash reserves of 0.1 million were withheld for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September
30, 2023. 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Distributable income for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 decreased to 0.4 million from 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023, royalty income decreased by 0.8 million while general and administrative expenses decreased by 0.2 million. 

Royalty income for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 1.4 million compared to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.8 million. This decrease
was due to a decrease in the average sales price between periods and a decrease in production. 

The average price realized for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 decreased 0.36 per Mcf to 0.97 per Mcf compared to 1.33 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease in the average sales price realized for natural gas production was due to a lower average sales price and slightly higher other
post-production costs. The average sales price, before post-production costs, decreased from 1.94 per Mcf for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 to 1.59 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in price was the result of a decrease in the weighted
average monthly closing NYMEX price for the current period to 2.10 per MMBtu compared to the weighted average monthly closing NYMEX
price of 2.68 per MMBtu for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average Basis per MMBtu realized for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 increased 0.24 per Mcf to minus 0.56 per Mcf compared to minus 0.80 per Mcf for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Post-production costs consist of a post-production
services fee together with a charge for electricity used in lieu of gas for compression on the gathering system and firm transportation
charges on interstate gas pipelines. Overall, average post-production costs were 0.62 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to 0.61 for the nine-month ended September 30, 2023. 

Production decreased 10.5 from 1,651 MMcf for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,478 MMcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to normal production declines as well
as compressor maintenance occurring on the GCGS during the current period. 

General and administrative
expenses paid by the Trust were 0.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of payments for professional
services expenses. Cash reserves of 0.1 million and 0.3 million were withheld for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Trust has no source
of liquidity or capital resources other than net cash flows from the Royalty Interests. Other than Trust administrative expenses, including,
if applicable, expense reimbursements to Greylock Production and any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, the Trust s
only use of cash is for distributions to Trust unitholders. Administrative expenses include payments to the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee
as well as a quarterly fee of 15,000 to Greylock Production pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement. Each quarter, the Trustee
determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the
Royalty Interests and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) that quarter, over the Trust s
expenses for that quarter. Available funds are reduced by any cash the Trustee determines to hold as a reserve against future expenses
or liabilities. The Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, may borrow funds required to pay expenses or liabilities if the Trustee determines
that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are insufficient to cover the Trust s expenses or liabilities. If the Trustee
borrows funds, the Trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid. 

15 

Since the first quarter of 2019, the Trustee has
been gradually building a cash reserve for the payment of future expenses and liabilities of the Trust by withholding cash reserve amounts
from each quarterly distribution. In November 2021, the Trustee notified the
Sponsor that the Trustee had determined to increase the targeted cash reserve from the initially stated amount of approximately 1.8
million, to approximately 3.8 million. From the first quarter of 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2022, the Trustee withheld an amount
from each distribution equal to the greater of 90,000 or 10 of the amount distributable to unitholders. Since achieving the
initial target of 1.8 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Trustee has been withholding, and currently plans to continue
to withhold, 90,000 per quarter until a total of approximately 3.8 million in cash reserves is withheld. For
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Trustee withheld 90,000 from the funds otherwise available for distribution and withheld a
minimal amount of interest earned on the cash reserve balance. As of September 30, 2024, the Trustee has withheld from the funds otherwise
available for distribution a total amount of approximately 2.2 million plus a minimal amount of interest toward the building of the
 3.8 million cash reserve. These withholdings are in addition to the existing cash reserve of 0.5 million, which is determined
prior to the payments of quarterly expenses. The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted amount at any time, and may increase or
decrease the rate at which it is withholding funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance notice to the unitholders. 

Payments to the Trust in respect of the Royalty
Interests are based on the complex provisions of the various conveyances held by the Trust, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the
2023 Form 10-K, and reference is hereby made to the text of the conveyances for the actual calculations of amounts due to the Trust. 

The Trust does not have any transactions, arrangements
or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the Trust s liquidity or the availability
of capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America GAAP because, among other differences, certain cash reserves may be established for contingencies,
which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Amortization of the investment in overriding royalty
interests calculated on a unit-of-production basis is charged directly to Trust Corpus. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than
GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by ASC Topic 932 Extractive Activities Oil
and Gas: Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. 

Income determined on the basis of GAAP would include
all expenses incurred for the period presented. However, the Trust serves as a pass-through entity, with expenses for depreciation, depletion,
and amortization, interest and income taxes being based on the status and elections of the Trust unitholders. General and administrative
expenses, production taxes or any other allowable costs are charged to the Trust only when cash has been paid for those expenses. In addition,
the Royalty Interests are not burdened by field and lease operating expenses. Thus, the statement shows distributable income, defined
as income of the Trust available for distribution to the Trust unitholders before application of those unitholders additional expenses,
if any, for depreciation, depletion, and amortization, interest and income taxes. The revenues are reflected net of existing royalties
and overriding royalties and have been reduced by gathering/post-production expenses. 

Revenue and Expenses: 

The Trust serves as a pass-through entity, with
items of depletion, interest income and expense, and income tax attributes being based upon the status and election of the unitholders.
Thus, the Statements of Distributable Income show income available for distribution before application of those unitholders additional
expenses, if any, for depletion, interest income and expense, and income taxes. 

The Trust uses the accrual basis to recognize revenue,
with royalty income recorded as reserves are extracted from the Underlying Properties and sold. Expenses are recognized when paid. 

16 

Royalty Interest in Gas Properties: 

The
Royalty interest in gas properties is assessed to determine whether the net capitalized cost is impaired, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, pursuant to ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment .
The Trust determines whether an impairment charge is necessary to its investment in the Royalty interest in gas properties if total capitalized
costs, less accumulated amortization, exceed undiscounted future net revenues attributable to proved gas reserves of the Underlying Properties.
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves estimates of fair value, which is determined based on discounted
cash flow techniques using assumptions including projected revenues, future commodity prices, production costs, and market-specific average
cost of capital. Estimates of undiscounted future net revenues attributable to proved gas reserves utilize estimates of future pricing,
which are generally developed based upon NYMEX forward pricing curves. If required, the Trust will recognize an impairment charge to the
extent that the net capitalized costs exceed the discounted fair value of the investment in net profits interests attributable to proved
gas reserves of the Underlying Properties. Any such impairment charge would not reduce Distributable Income, although it would reduce
Trust Corpus. No impairment in the Underlying Properties was recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Significant dispositions
or abandonment of the Underlying Properties are charged to Royalty Interests and the Trust Corpus. 

Amortization of the Royalty interest in gas properties
is calculated on a units-of-production basis, whereby the Trust s cost basis in the properties is divided by Trust total proved
reserves to derive an amortization rate per reserve unit. Such amortization does not reduce Distributable Income, rather it is charged
directly to Trust Corpus. Revisions to estimated future units-of-production are treated on a prospective basis beginning on the date significant
revisions are known. 

The conveyance of the Royalty Interests to the
Trust was accounted for as a purchase transaction. The 352,100,000 reflected in the Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Trust Corpus
as Royalty interest in gas properties represents 17,605,000 Trust units valued at 20.00 per unit. The carrying value of the Trust s
investment in the Royalty Interests is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of such Royalty Interests. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company as
defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Trust is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Trustee maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated by Greylock Production
to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee of the Trust, and its employees who participate in the preparation of the
Trust s periodic reports as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by this report,
the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the Trustee s disclosure controls and procedures. Sarah Newell, as Trust Officer of the
Trustee, has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust are effective. 

Certain
characteristics of the Trust may limit the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures established by the Trustee.
The limitations include the facts that: 

Greylock Production and its consolidated subsidiaries manage virtually all of the information relating to the Trust, including all
information regarding (i) historical operating data, production volumes, the number of producing wells and acreage, the marketing
and sale of production, operating and capital expenditures, environmental matters and other potential expenses and liabilities, and the
effects of regulatory matters and changes, (ii) plans for future operating and capital expenditures and (iii) geological data
relating to reserves, and the Trustee necessarily relies on Greylock Production for all such information; and 

17 

The Trustee necessarily relies upon the independent reserve engineer as an expert with respect to the annual reserve report, which
includes projected production, operating expenses and capital expenses. 

Other
than reviewing the financial and other information provided to the Trust by Greylock Production and the independent reserve engineer,
the Trustee has made no independent or direct verification of this financial or other information. 

The Trustee does not intend to expand its responsibilities
beyond those permitted or required by the Trust Agreement and those required under applicable law. 

The
Trustee does not expect that the Trustee s disclosure controls and procedures or the Trustee s internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all errors or all fraud. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in the Trustee s
internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trustee s
internal control over financial reporting relating to the Trust. The Trustee notes for purposes of clarification that it has no authority
over, and makes no statement concerning, the internal control over financial reporting of Greylock Energy.

APPENDIX A 

GLOSSARY OF CERTAIN TERMS 

The following are definitions of certain significant
terms used in this report. Other terms are defined in the text of this report. 

AMI
 - The area of mutual interest, or AMI, consisted of the Marcellus Shale formation in approximately 121 square miles of
property located in Greene County, Pennsylvania in which Legacy ECA had leased approximately 9,300 acres and owned substantially
all of the working interests at the date of formation of the Trust. Legacy ECA was obligated to drill the 52 development wells from drill
sites on approximately 9,300 leased acres in the AMI. Until Legacy ECA satisfied its drilling obligation on November 30, 2011, it
was not permitted to drill and complete any well in the Marcellus Shale formation within the AMI for its own account. 

Basis 
- The difference between the spot or cash price and the futures price of the same or related commodity. For natural gas, basis equals
the local cash market price minus the price of the nearby NYMEX natural gas futures contract. 

Completion 
- (or its derivatives) means that the well has been perforated, stimulated, tested and permanent equipment for the production of natural
gas has been installed. 

Development
Agreement - An agreement under which Legacy ECA was obligated to drill all of the PUD Wells no later than March 31, 2014.
In order to secure the estimated amount of the drilling costs for the Trust s interests in the PUD Wells, Legacy ECA granted to
the Trust a lien on Legacy ECA s interest in the Marcellus Shale formation in the AMI, excluding the Producing Wells and any other
wells which were producing and not subject to the Royalty Interests. 

Equivalent
PUD Well - is defined as a well that is drilled horizontally in the Marcellus formation for a lateral distance of 2,500 feet
measured from the midpoint of the curve to the end of the lateral multiplied by the working interest held by Legacy ECA. Wells with
a horizontal lateral less than 2,500 feet count as fractional wells in proportion to the total lateral length divided by 2,500 feet. 
Wells with a horizontal lateral greater than 2,500 feet (subject to a maximum of 3,500 feet) count as fractional wells in proportion to
the total lateral length divided by 2,500 feet.

are actually removed from the Gas stream by separation, processing or other means.

Act of 1933, as amended, relating to the initial public offering of the Trust units. 

SEC 
- means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Subject
Gas - means Gas from the Marcellus Shale formation from any Producing Well or PUD Well. 

Working
Interest - The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own oil, gas, or other minerals.
