Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities 
 Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of 
 historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking 
 statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future 
 performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to 
 historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, 
 plan, intend, believe, may, will, should, can have, likely and other words and terms of similar meaning in 
 connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. For 
 example, all statements we make relating to our estimated costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial 
 results, any future dividends, our plans, anticipated amount and timing of cost savings relating to the restructuring plan, and 
 objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives, strategies or the expected outcome or impact of pending or 
 threatened litigation, are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
 that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including: 
 our failure to successfully execute our succession plan for Patrick G. Ryan or other members of our senior 
 management team or to recruit and retain revenue producers; 
 the impact of breaches in security that cause significant system or network disruption or business interruption; 
 the impact of improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data, misuse of information by 
 employees or counterparties, or as a result of cyberattacks; 
 the potential loss of our relationships with insurance carriers or our clients, failure to maintain good relationships 
 with insurance carriers or clients, becoming dependent upon a limited number of insurance carriers or clients, or 
 the failure to develop new insurance carrier and client relationships; 
 errors in, or ineffectiveness of, our underwriting models and the risks presented to our reputation and relationships 
 with insurance carriers, retail brokers, and agents; 
 failure to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand or prevent damage to our reputation; 
 unsatisfactory evaluation of potential acquisitions, the integration of acquired businesses, and/or introduction of 
 new products, lines of business, and markets; 
 our inability to successfully recover upon experiencing a disaster or other interruption in business continuity; 
 the impact of third parties that perform key functions of our business operations acting in ways that harm our 
 business; 
 the cyclicality of, and the economic conditions in, the markets in which we operate and conditions that result in 
 reduced insurer capacity or a migration of business away from the E S market and into the Admitted market; 
 a reduction in insurer capacity to adequately and appropriately underwrite risk and provide coverage; 
 our international operations expose us to various international risks, including required compliance with legal and 
 regulatory obligations, that are different, and at times more burdensome, than those set forth in the United States; 
 changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances or interest 
 income; 
 failure to maintain the valuable aspects of our Company s culture; 
 significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses; 
 decreases in premiums or commission rates set by insurers, or actions by insurers seeking repayment of 
 commissions; 
 decrease in the amount of supplemental or contingent commissions we receive; 
 our inability to collect our receivables; 
 disintermediation within the insurance industry and shifts away from traditional insurance markets; 
 changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry; 
 impairment of goodwill and intangibles; 
 the impact on our operations and financial condition from the effects of a pandemic or the outbreak of a 
 contagious disease and resulting governmental and societal responses; 

ii 

the inability to maintain rapid growth and generate sufficient revenue to maintain profitability; 
 the loss of clients or business as a result of consolidation within the retail insurance brokerage industry; 
 the impact if our MGA or MGU programs are terminated or changed; 
 the inability to achieve the intended results of our previously announced restructuring program; 
 significant investment in our growth strategy and whether expectation of internal efficiencies are realized; 
 our ability to gain internal efficiencies through the application of technology or effectively apply technology in 
 driving value for our clients or the failure of technology and automated systems to function or perform as 
 expected; 
 the unavailability or inaccuracy of our clients and third parties data for pricing and underwriting insurance 
 policies; 
 the competitiveness and cyclicality of the reinsurance industry; 
 the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters; 
 the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate; 
 the challenges with properly assessing, and managing the adoption and use of, artificial intelligence technologies; 
 the failure or take-over by the FDIC of one of the financial institutions that we use; 
 our inability to respond quickly to operational or financial problems or promote the desired level of cooperation 
 and interaction among our offices; 
 our international operations expose us to various international risks, including exchange rate fluctuations; 
 the impact of governmental regulations, legal proceedings, and governmental inquiries related to our business; 
 being subject to E O claims as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings; 
 our handling of client funds and surplus lines taxes that exposes us to complex fiduciary regulations; 
 the impact of infringement, misappropriation, or dilution of our intellectual property; 
 the impact of the failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the 
 intellectual property rights of others; 
 changes in tax laws or regulations; 
 decreased commission revenues due to proposed tort reform legislation; 
 the impact of regulations affecting insurance carriers; 
 our outstanding debt potentially adversely affecting our financial flexibility and subjecting us to restrictions and 
 limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate; 
 not being able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and being forced to take other 
 actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness; 
 being affected by further changes in the U.S. based credit markets; 
 changes in our credit ratings; 
 risks related to the payments required by our Tax Receivable Agreement; 
 risks relating to our organizational structure that could result in conflicts of interests between the LLC 
 Unitholders, the Ryan Parties, and the holders of our Class A common stock; and 
 other factors disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our 
 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts that are based on many 
 detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict 
 the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are 
 disclosed under the sections entitled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
 and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under the Section entitled Risk Factors in the 
 Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. All written and oral forward-looking 

iii 

statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary 
 statements as well as other cautionary statements that are made from time to time in our filings with the SEC and other 
 public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q 
 in the context of these risks and uncertainties. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. 
 These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and 
 while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or 
 incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review 
 of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not 
 to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In 
 addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if 
 substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The 
 forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date hereof. We 
 undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or 
 otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.

As the Reload and Staking Class C Incentive Units were one-time grants at the IPO, the weighted average participation 
 threshold for these awards will be consistent across any type of movement. The weighted average participation threshold 
 for Reload and Staking Class C Incentive Units was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , 
 respectively. The decrease in the participation thresholds for the various types of Class C Incentive Units was due to the

PSUs represent the right to receive Class A common shares and PLUs represent the right to receive LLC Common Units 
 upon vesting. If the Adjusted EBITDAC Margin and the Organic Revenue Growth CAGR targets are achieved, and the 
 TSR CAGR meets at least the minimum threshold, the TSR CAGR targets will determine how many Class A common 
 shares or LLC Common Units, as applicable, the awards vest into. Assuming the minimum threshold is met, the awards 
 will vest into between and of the applicable stock or units. The payout percentage between the TSR CAGR 
 range will be determined on a graduated basis. Confirmation of the targets will not occur until after the Company s fiscal 
 year 2028 earnings are reported. If the targets are achieved, the awards will vest on April 1, 2029. The probability of 
 achieving the performance metrics is assessed each reporting period for expense purposes.

 was an economic hedge and had not been designated as an accounting hedge, losses resulting from the Deal-Contingent 
 Forward were recognized through earnings in the periods incurred. 
 Interest Rate Cap 
 In April 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
 related to the Company s Term Loan in the amount of million . The interest rate cap has a million notional 
 amount, strike, and terminates on December 31, 2025. At inception, the Company formally designated the interest 
 rate cap as a cash flow hedge. As of September 30, 2024 , the interest rate cap continued to be an effective hedge. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the decrease of million and million , respectively, in 
 the fair value of the interest rate cap were recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss). For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the decrease of million and increase of million , respectively, in the fair value of 
 the interest rate cap were recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss). As of September 30, 2024 , the Company 
 expects million of unrealized gains from the interest rate cap to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve 
 months. See Note 16 , Income Taxes , for further information on the tax effects on other comprehensive income OCI

 Derivative Instruments 
 Deal-Contingent Foreign Currency Forward 
 The Company entered into the Deal-Contingent Forward to manage the risk of appreciation of the GBP-denominated 
 purchase price of the Castel acquisition. The fair value of the Deal-Contingent Forward was determined by comparing the 
 contractual foreign exchange rates to forward market rates for various future dates, probability weighted for when the 
 acquisition was anticipated to close, and discounted to the valuation date. The lowest level of inputs used that are 
 significant in determining the fair value were considered Level 3 inputs. See Note 11 , Derivatives , for further information 
 on the Deal-Contingent Forward. 
 Interest Rate Cap 
 The Company uses an interest rate cap to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to the Company s Term 
 Loan. The fair value of the interest rate cap is determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future 
 expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the cap. The variable interest 
 rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived 
 from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The inputs used in determining the fair value of the interest rate 
 cap are considered Level 2 inputs. See Note 11 , Derivatives , for further information on the interest rate cap. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 The fair values of contingent consideration and contingently returnable consideration are based on the present value of the 
 future expected payments to be made to the sellers and to be received from the sellers, respectively, of certain acquired 
 businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements, which are Level 3 fair value 
 measurements. In determining fair value, the Company estimates cash payments and receipts based on management s 
 financial projections of the performance of each acquired business relative to the formula specified by each purchase 
 agreement. The Company utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate financial projections of each acquired business. The 
 Monte Carlo models consider forecasted revenue and EBITDA and market risk-adjusted revenue and EBITDA, which are 
 run through a series of simulations. As of September 30, 2024 , the models used risk-free rates, expected volatility, and a 
 credit spread that ranged from to , to , and to , respectively. As of December 31, 2023 , 
 the models used risk-free rates, expected volatility, and a credit spread that ranged from to , to , and 
 to , respectively. The Company discounts the expected payments created by the Monte Carlo model to present 
 value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the market-based rates of return that reflect the ability of the 
 acquired entity to achieve its targets. The discount rate ranges used to present value the cash payments were to 
 and to as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 Each period, the Company revalues the contingent consideration and contingently returnable consideration associated with 
 certain prior acquisitions to their fair value and records the related changes of the fair value in Change in contingent 
 consideration in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Changes in contingent consideration result from changes in 
 the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related EBITDA and revenue milestones, the 
 estimated timing in which milestones are achieved, and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability. 
 Contingent consideration may change significantly as the Company s revenue growth rate and EBITDA estimates evolve 
 and additional data is obtained, impacting the Company s assumptions. The use of different assumptions and judgments 
 could result in a different estimate of fair value which may have a material impact on the results from operations and 
 financial position. See Note 3 , Mergers and Acquisitions , for further information on contingent consideration.

 million in excess of a 
 per claim retention amount of million . The Company s aggregate coverage for E O losses increased from 
 million to million as of June 1, 2024 . The Company s per claim retention amount increased from million to 
 million as of June 1, 2023 . The Company periodically determines a range of possible outcomes using the best 
 available information that relies, in part, on projecting historical claim data into the future. Loss contingencies of 
 million and million were recorded for outstanding matters as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , 
 respectively. Loss contingencies exclude the impact of any loss recoveries. The Company recognized the net impact of the 
 loss contingencies and any loss recoveries of a million benefit and million expense for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million expense for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, in General and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of 
 Income (Loss). The historical claim and commercial accommodation data used to project the current estimates may not be 
 indicative of future claim activity. Thus, the estimates could change in the future as more information becomes known, 
 which could materially impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. 
 During 2022, the Company placed certain insurance policies through a trading partner with the understanding that the 
 policies were underwritten by highly rated insurance capital. The policies were instead underwritten by an insurance carrier 
 that was not considered satisfactory by the Company or the insureds. The Company committed to securing replacement 
 coverage, to the extent commercially available, from highly rated insurance companies on terms substantially similar to the 
 insurance coverage originally agreed upon. As a result of this unusual circumstance, the Company has and may continue to 
 incur losses Replacement Costs arising from the original placements. The Company has determined that it is probable 
 that it will be exposed to the Replacement Costs on policies placed with this trading partner. The Company recognized an 
 estimated loss contingency of million and million , respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 
 2023 , within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Relatedly, the Company has 
 obtained sufficient evidence from its E O insurance carriers to conclude that a recovery of the claim for the Replacement 
 Costs, in excess of the million retention, is probable. A loss recovery of million and million was recorded 
 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance 
 Sheets. In the aggregate, the loss contingency and related loss recovery resulted in a million expense recognized in 
 2022 and further expense related to this matter has been recognized since. 
 It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of Replacement Costs will change in the near term as policies are 
 adjusted. Further, exposure to additional losses may arise from policies that had expired prior to, or shortly after, the 
 discovery of this unusual circumstance, adjustable premiums arising from the addition or deletion of properties over the 
 policy term, unpaid covered claims, or other damages for losses incurred by our customers. An estimate of these potential 
 losses cannot be made at this time but could change in the future as more information becomes known.

 affiliated investors are LLC Unitholders and directors of the Company, and another is an LLC 
 Unitholder and employee of the Company. Ryan Specialty does not consolidate GRH as the Company does not have a 
 direct investment in or variable interest in this entity. 
 The Company holds a interest in RIH and GRH holds the remaining interest. RIH has a non-controlling 
 interest in GRP and the other is owned by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. GRP wholly owns Geneva Re, Ltd 
 Geneva Re ), a Bermuda-regulated reinsurance company, and GR Bermuda SAC Ltd (the Segregated Account

 equity method investment as a result of underwriting losses recognized at Geneva Re or losses on Geneva Re s investment 
 portfolio. RIH has committed to contribute additional capital to GRP over the next several years. Patrick G. Ryan, through 
 a trust of which he is the beneficiary and co-trustee, has committed to personally fund any such additional capital 
 contributions. Any such additional capital contributions under this commitment will not affect the relative ownership of 
 RIH s common equity. 
 Geneva Re 
 The Company has a service agreement with Geneva Re to provide both administrative services to, as well as disburse 
 payments for costs directly incurred by, Geneva Re. These direct costs include compensation expenses incurred by 
 employees of Geneva Re. The Company had million and million due from Geneva Re under this agreement as of 
 September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 Ryan Re Services Agreements with Geneva Re 
 Ryan Re, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is party to a services agreement with Geneva Re to provide, among 
 other services, certain underwriting and administrative services to Geneva Re. Ryan Re receives a service fee equal to 
 of the administrative costs incurred by Ryan Re in providing these services to Geneva Re. Revenue earned from 
 Geneva Re was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Receivables due from Geneva Re under this 
 agreement were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 On April 2, 2023, Ryan Re entered into a services agreement with Geneva Re in accordance with which Ryan Re 
 subcontracted certain services to Geneva Re that Ryan Re is required to provide to the segregated account of the 
 Segregated Account Company on behalf of the Third-party Insurer. The Company incurred expense of million and 
 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million 
 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 
 2023 , the Company had prepaid expense s of million and million , respectively, related to this services agreement. 
 The prepaid expenses are included in Other currents assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Company Leasing of Corporate Jets 
 In the ordinary course of its business, the Company charters executive jets for business purposes from Executive Jet 
 Management EJM ), a third-party service provider. Mr. Ryan indirectly owns aircraft that he leases to EJM for EJM s 
 charter operations for which he receives remuneration from EJM. The Company pays market rates for chartering aircraft 
 through EJM, unless the particular aircraft chartered is Mr. Ryan s, in which case the Company receives a discount below 
 market rates. Historically, the Company has been able to charter Mr. Ryan s aircraft and make use of this discount. The 
 Company recognized expense related to business usage of aircraft of million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , 
 respectively. 
 
 16.) and for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 
 2023 , respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were lower than the 
 st atutory rate primarily as a result of the vesting of IPO RSUs, exercising of Stock Options, an d the income 
 attributable to the non-controlling interests. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30,

statutory rate primarily as a result of the million non-cash deferred income tax 
 expense from the common control reorganization described below, which was recognized in Income tax expense in the 
 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 The Company does not believe it has any significant uncertain tax positions and therefore has unrecognized tax benefits 
 as of September 30, 2024 , that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate 
 material changes in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve-month period. 
 Deferred Taxes 
 The Company reported Deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities where appropriate, of million and 
 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase 
 in the Deferred tax assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was primarily related to exchanges of LLC 
 Common Units. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company concluded that, based on the weight of all available positive and 
 negative evidence, the Deferred tax assets with respect to the Company s basis difference in its investment in the LLC are 
 more likely than not to be realized. As such, valuation allowance has been recognized against that basis difference. 
 Common Control Reorganization CCR 
 Subsequent to the acquisition of Socius, which was acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryan Specialty Holdings, 
 Inc., the Company converted Socius to an LLC Socius LLC and transferred Socius LLC to the LLC. This legal entity 
 reorganization was considered a transaction between entities under common control. The CCR resulted in deferred tax 
 liabilities of million established and non-cash deferred income tax expense of million for the three and nine 
 months ended September 30, 2023 . Additionally, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the 
 investment transferred under common control resulted in an increase of million to Non-controlling interests on the 
 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity during the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA) 
 The Company is party to a TRA with current and certain former LLC Unitholders. The TRA provides for the payment by 
 the Company to the current and certain former LLC Unitholders of of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, 
 state, and local income taxes that the Company realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) 
 certain increases in the tax basis of the assets of the LLC resulting from purchases or exchanges of LLC Common Units 
 Exchange Tax Attributes ), (ii) certain tax attributes of the LLC that existed prior to the IPO Pre-IPO M A Tax 
 Attributes ), (iii) certain favorable remedial partnership tax allocations to which the Company becomes entitled (if any), 
 and (iv) certain other tax benefits related to the Company entering into the TRA, including certain tax benefits attributable 
 to payments that the Company makes under the TRA TRA Payment Tax Attributes ). The Company recognizes a 
 liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the undiscounted estimated future payments under the TRA. The 
 amounts payable under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character, and timing 
 of the taxable income of the Company in the future. 
 Based on current projections, the Company anticipates having sufficient taxable income to be able to realize the benefits 
 and has recorded Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities of million related to these benefits on the Consolidated 
 Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 .

 The following discussion provides commentary on the financial results derived from our unaudited financial statements for 
 the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we 
 regularly review the following Non-GAAP measures when assessing performance: Organic revenue growth rate, Adjusted 
 compensation and benefits expense, Adjusted compensation and benefits expense ratio, Adjusted general and 
 administrative expense, Adjusted general and administrative expense ratio, Adjusted EBITDAC, Adjusted EBITDAC 
 margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share. See Non-GAAP 
 Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators for further information. 
 
 Overview 
 Founded by Patrick G. Ryan in 2010, we are a service provider of specialty products and solutions for insurance brokers, 
 agents, and carriers. We provide distribution, underwriting, product development, administration, and risk management 
 services by acting predominantly as a wholesale broker and a managing underwriter or a program administrator with 
 delegated authority from insurance carriers. Our mission is to provide industry-leading innovative specialty insurance 
 solutions for insurance brokers, agents, and carriers. 
 For retail insurance agents and brokers, we assist in the placement of complex or otherwise hard-to-place risks. For 
 insurance and reinsurance carriers, we predominantly work with retail and wholesale insurance brokers to source, onboard, 
 underwrite, and service these same types of risks. A significant majority of the premiums we place are bound in the E S 
 market, which includes Lloyd s of London. There is often significantly more flexibility in terms, conditions, and rates in 
 the E S market relative to the Admitted or standard insurance market. We believe that the additional freedom to craft 
 bespoke terms and conditions in the E S market allows us to best meet the needs of our trading partners, provide unique 
 solutions, and drive innovation. We believe our success has been achieved by providing best-in-class intellectual capital, 
 leveraging our trusted and long-standing relationships, and developing differentiated solutions at a scale unmatched by 
 many of our competitors. 
 
 Significant Events and Transactions 
 Corporate Structure 
 We are a holding company and our sole material asset is a controlling equity interest in New LLC, which is also a holding 
 company and its sole material asset is a controlling equity interest in the LLC. The Company operates and controls the 
 business and affairs of, and consolidates the financial results of, the LLC through New LLC. We conduct our business 
 through the LLC. As the LLC is substantively the same as New LLC, for the purpose of this discussion we will refer to 
 both New LLC and the LLC as the LLC. 
 The LLC is a limited liability company taxed as a partnership for income tax purposes, and its taxable income or loss is 
 passed through to its members, including the Company. The LLC is subject to income taxes on its taxable income in certain 
 foreign countries, in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on partnerships, and on the taxable 
 income of its U.S. corporate subsidiaries. As a result of our ownership of LLC Common Units, we are subject to U.S. 
 federal, state, and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of the LLC and are taxed at 
 the prevailing corporate tax rates. We intend to cause the LLC to make distributions in an amount that is at least sufficient 
 to allow us to pay our tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any ordinary course payments 
 due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Tax Receivable Agreement for 
 additional information about the TRA.

ACCELERATE 2025 Program 
 During the first quarter of 2023 we initiated the ACCELERATE 2025 program that will enable continued growth, drive 
 innovation, and deliver sustainable productivity improvements over the long term. The program, in its expanded scope, will 
 result in approximately 110.0 million of cumulative one-time charges through 2024, funded through operating cash flow. 
 Restructuring costs are estimated to be approximately evenly split between General and administrative expense, relating to 
 third-party professional services, lease and contract terminations costs, and other expenses and Compensation and benefits 
 expense, predominately relating to third-party contractor and other workforce-related costs. We expect the program, in its 
 expanded scope, to generate annual savings of approximately 60.0 million in 2025. See Note 4 , Restructuring of the 
 unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred restructuring costs of 47.8 million . Combined with 
 restructuring costs incurred during 2023, we have incurred restructuring costs of 96.2 million since the first quarter of 
 2023, representing the inception of the plan. Of the cumulative 96.2 million in costs, 37.9 million was general and 
 administrative with the remaining balance being workforce-related. While the current results of the ACCELERATE 2025 
 program are in line with expectations, changes to the total savings estimate and timing of the ACCELERATE 2025 
 program may evolve as we continue to progress through the plan and evaluate other potential opportunities. The actual 
 amounts and timing may vary significantly based on various factors. 
 Acquisitions 
 On May 1, 2024 , the Company completed the acquisition of Castel Underwriting Agencies Limited Castel ), an MGU 
 platform. Castel is headquartered in London, England with additional offices in the Netherlands and Belgium and 
 operations in Singapore. 
 On August 30, 2024 , the Company completed the acquisition of US Assure Insurance Services of Florida, Inc. US 
 Assure ), a program specializing in builder s risk insurance headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. 
 On September 1, 2024 , the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Greenhill Underwriting Insurance 
 Services, LLC Greenhill ), an MGU focused on the allied health industry headquartered in Houston, Texas. 
 On September 13, 2024 , the Company completed the acquisition of the Property and Casualty P C MGUs owned by 
 Ethos Specialty Insurance, LLC Ethos P C ). Ethos P C comprises eight programs which underwrite on behalf of 
 insurance carriers. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of EverSports Entertainment Insurance, 
 Inc., an MGU focused on sports, leisure and entertainment risks based in Carmel, Indiana. 
 On October 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of the European managing general agent, 
 Geo Underwriting Europe BV, a financial lines MGA based in Rotterdam, Netherlands, with operations in Germany. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our 
 ability to: 
 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions 
 We have successfully integrated businesses complementary to our own to increase both our distribution reach and our 
 product and service capabilities. We continuously evaluate acquisitions and intend to further pursue targeted acquisitions 
 that complement our product and service capabilities or provide us access to new markets. We have previously made, and 
 intend to continue to make, acquisitions with the objective of enhancing our human capital and product and service 
 capabilities, entering natural adjacencies, and expanding our geographic presence. Our ability to successfully pursue 
 strategic acquisitions is dependent upon a number of factors, including sustained execution of a disciplined and selective 
 acquisition strategy which requires acquisition targets to have a cultural and strategic fit, competition for these assets, 
 purchase price multiples that we deem appropriate and our ability to effectively integrate targeted companies or assets and 
 grow our business. We do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions at this time. 
 Deepen and Broaden our Relationships with Retail Broker Trading Partners 
 We have deep engagement with our retail broker trading partners, and we believe we have the ability to transact in even 
 greater volume with nearly all of them. For example, in 2023, our revenue derived from the Top 100 firms (as ranked by 

38 

Business Insurance) expanded faster than our Organic revenue growth rate of 15.4 (beginning in the first quarter of 2024, 
 the Company changed its method of calculating Organic revenue growth rate, a non-GAAP measure, see Non-GAAP 
 Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators - Organic Revenue Growth Rate for more information). Our ability 
 to deepen and broaden relationships with our retail broker trading partners and increase sales is dependent upon a number 
 of factors, including client satisfaction with our distribution reach and our product capabilities, retail brokers continuing to 
 require or desire our services, competition, pricing, economic conditions, and spending on our product offerings. 
 Build Our National Binding Authority Specialty 
 We believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to grow our Binding Authority Specialty, as we believe that both 
 M A consolidation and panel consolidation are in the early stages in the binding authority market. Our ability to grow our 
 Binding Authority Specialty is dependent upon a number of factors, including a continuing ability to secure sufficient 
 capital support from insurers, the quality of our services and product offerings, marketing and sales efforts to drive new 
 business prospects and execution, new product offerings, the pricing and quality of our competitors offerings, and the 
 growth in demand for the insurance products. 
 Invest in Operation and Growth 
 We have invested heavily in building a durable business that is able to adapt to the continuously evolving E S market and 
 intend to continue to do so. We are focused on enhancing the breadth of our product and service offerings as well as 
 developing and launching new solutions to address the evolving needs of the specialty insurance industry and markets. Our 
 future success is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully develop, market, and sell 
 existing and new products and services to both new and existing trading partners. 
 Generate Commission Regardless of the State of the E S Market 
 We earn commissions, which are calculated as a percentage of the total insurance policy premium, and fees. Changes in the 
 insurance market or specialty lines that are our focus, characterized by a period of increasing (or declining) premium rates, 
 could positively (or negatively) impact our profitability. 
 Managing Changing Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Growth in certain lines of business, such as project-based construction and M A transactional liability insurance, is 
 partially dependent on a variety of macroeconomic factors inasmuch as binding the underlying insurance coverage is 
 subject to the underlying activity occurring. In periods of economic growth and liquid credit markets, this underlying 
 activity can accelerate and provide tailwinds to our growth. In periods of economic decline and tight credit markets, this 
 underlying activity can slow or be delayed and provide headwinds to our growth. We believe over the long term these lines 
 of business will continue to grow. 
 Leverage the Growth of the E S Market 
 The growing relevance of the E S market has been driven by the rapid emergence of large, complex, high-hazard, and 
 otherwise hard-to-place risks across many lines of insurance. This trend continued in 2023, with 80 billion of insured 
 catastrophe losses, mostly driven by a record setting year, both in frequency and severity, for severe convective storms 
 SCS with 21 SCS events above 1 billion in losses, which together accounted for 58 billion in losses. The year also 
 included hurricane losses on both the East and West coasts of the US, and sizable wildfire losses. Additionally, these risks 
 include the potential for more severe hurricanes that occur with greater frequency, more devastating wildfires, more 
 frequent flooding, escalating jury verdicts and social inflation, geographic shifts in population density, a proliferation of 
 cyber threats, novel health risks, risks associated with large sports and entertainment venues, building and labor cost 
 inflation relative to insured value, and the transformation of the economy to a digital first mode of doing business. We 
 believe that as the complexity of the E S market continues to escalate, wholesale brokers and managing underwriters that 
 do not have sufficient scale, or the financial and intellectual capital to invest in the required specialty capabilities, will 
 struggle to compete effectively. This will further the trend of market share consolidation among the wholesale firms that do 
 have these capabilities. We will continue to invest in our intellectual capital to innovate and offer custom solutions and 
 products to better address these evolving market fundamentals. 
 Although we believe this growth will continue, we recognize that the growth of the E S market might not be linear as 
 risks can and do shift between the E S and non-E S markets as market factors change and evolve. For example, we 
 benefited from a rapid increase in both the flow of property risks into the wholesale channel and the premium rate charged 
 for those risks in 2023 as the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, attritional losses and secondary perils such as 
 severe convective storms, economic inflation, concentration of exposures, higher retentions of risk, and higher reinsurance 

39 

costs applied pressure to insurers and capacity tightened. If industry trends reverse, it may open opportunities for rates to 
 decline or retailers to place some of that coverage directly. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Net Commissions and Fees 
 Net commissions and fees are derived primarily from our three Specialties and are paid for our role as an intermediary in 
 facilitating the placement of coverage in the insurance distribution chain. Net commissions and policy fees are generally 
 calculated as a percentage of the total insurance policy premium placed, although fees can often be a fixed amount 
 irrespective of the premium, and we also receive supplemental commissions based on the volume placed or profitability of 
 a book of business. We share a portion of these net commissions and policy fees with the retail insurance broker and 
 recognize revenue on a net basis. Additionally, carriers may also pay us a contingent commission or volume-based 
 commission, both of which represent forms of contingent or supplemental consideration associated with the placement of 
 coverage and are based primarily on underwriting results, but may also contain considerations for only volume, growth, 
 and/or retention. Although we have compensation arrangements called contingent commissions in all three Specialties that 
 are based in whole or in part on the underwriting performance, we do not take any direct insurance risk other than through 
 our equity method investment in Geneva Re through Ryan Investment Holdings, LLC. We also receive loss mitigation and 
 other fees, some of which are not dependent on the placement of a risk. 
 In our Wholesale Brokerage and Binding Authority Specialties, we generally work with retail insurance brokers to secure 
 insurance coverage for their clients, who are the ultimate insured party. Our Wholesale Brokerage and Binding Authority 
 Specialties generate revenues through commissions and fees from clients, as well as through supplemental commissions, 
 which may be contingent commissions or volume-based commissions from carriers. Commission rates and fees vary 
 depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance coverage provided, the 
 particular services provided to a client or carrier, and the capacity in which we act. Payment terms are consistent with 
 current industry practice. 
 In our Underwriting Management Specialty we utilize delegated authority granted to us by carriers and we generally work 
 with retail insurance brokers and often other wholesale brokers to secure insurance coverage for the ultimate insured party. 
 Our Underwriting Management Specialty generates revenues through commissions and fees from clients and through 
 contingent commissions from carriers. Commission rates and fees vary depending upon several factors including the 
 premium, the type of coverage, and additional services provided to the client. Payment terms are consistent with current 
 industry practice. 
 Fiduciary Investment Income 
 Fiduciary investment income consists of interest earned on insurance premiums and surplus lines taxes that are held in a 
 fiduciary capacity, in cash and cash equivalents, until disbursed. 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 Compensation and benefits is our largest expense. It consists of (i) salary, incentives and benefits to employees, and 
 commissions to our producers and (ii) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of awards to employees, 
 executive officers, and directors. We operate in competitive markets for human capital and we need to maintain 
 competitive compensation levels in order to maintain and grow our talent base. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense includes travel and entertainment expenses, office expenses, accounting, foreign 
 exchange, legal, insurance and other professional fees, and other costs associated with our operations. Our occupancy- 
 related costs and professional services expenses, in particular, generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the 
 number of our employees and the overall size and scale of our business operations. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization expense consists primarily of amortization related to intangible assets we acquired in connection with our 
 acquisitions. Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trade names, and internally developed software. 

40 

Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net consists of interest payable on indebtedness, amortization of the Company s interest rate cap, imputed 
 interest on contingent consideration, and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, offset by interest income on the 
 Company s Cash and cash equivalents balances and payments received in relation to the interest rate cap. 
 Other Non-Operating Loss (Income) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Other non-operating loss (income) consisted of expense related to term 
 loan modifications and TRA contractual interest and related charges offset by sublease income. For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2023 , Other non-operating income included sublease income offset by TRA contractual interest and related 
 charges. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Income tax expense (benefit) includes tax on the Company s allocable share of any net taxable income from the LLC, from 
 certain state and local jurisdictions that impose taxes on partnerships, as well as earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and 
 C-Corporations subject to entity level taxation. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 Net income and Other comprehensive income (loss) are attributed to the non-controlling interests based on the weighted- 
 average LLC Common Units outstanding during the period and is presented on the Consolidated Statements of Income 
 (Loss). Refer to Note 8 , Stockholders Equity of the unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements for more 
 information.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue 
 Total Revenue 
 Total revenue increased by 102.8 million , or 20.5 , from 501.9 million to 604.7 million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The following were the principal drivers of the 
 increase: 
 56.8 million, or 11.3 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to organic revenue growth. 
 Organic revenue growth represents the change in Net commissions and fees revenue, as compared to the same 
 period for the year prior, adjusted for Net commissions and fees attributable to recent acquisitions during the 
 first twelve months of Ryan Specialty s ownership, and other adjustments such as the removal of the impact of 
 contingent commissions and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. In aggregate, our net commission 
 rates were consistent period-over-period. Also, we grew our client relationships, in aggregate, within each of 
 our three Specialties. The growth of these relationships is due to the combination of a growing E S market 
 and winning new business from competitors. Growth in the quarter was balanced across our property and 
 casualty portfolios within our three Specialties, driven by an increase in the flow of risks into the E S market; 
 33.4 million, or 6.7 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to the acquisitions of 
 AccuRisk, Castel, US Assure, Greenhill, and Ethos P C, all of which were completed within twelve months of 
 September 30, 2024 ; 
 10.6 million, or 2.1 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to changes in contingent 
 commissions and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the Company s Net commissions and fees; and 
 2.0 million, or 0.4 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to an increase in Fiduciary 
 investment income, caused by a rise in interest rates and a rise in fiduciary balances compared to the prior year.

Net commissions and policy fees grew 18.1 , in line with the overall net commissions and fee revenue growth of 20.7 , 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The main drivers of this 
 growth continue to be the acquisition of new business and expansion of ongoing client relationships in response to the 
 increasing demand for new, complex E S products as well as the inflow of risks from the Admitted market into the E S 
 market and an increase in the premium rate for risks placed. In aggregate, we experienced stable commission rates period- 
 over-period. 
 Supplemental and contingent commissions increased 138.1 period-over-period driven by the performance of risks placed 
 on eligible business earning profit-based or volume-based commissions. 
 Loss mitigation and other fees increased 43.0 period-over-period primarily due increased capital markets activity, certain 
 fees related to the ACE, Point6, and AccuRisk acquisitions completed in the second half of 2023, and captive management 
 and other risk management service fees from the placement of alternative risk insurance solutions. 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 Compensation and benefits expense increased by 64.0 million , or 19.5 , from 329.2 million to 393.2 million for the 
 three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023 . The following were the principal drivers of 
 this increase: 
 Commissions increased 21.5 million, or 14.9 , period-over-period, driven by the 20.7 increase in Net 
 commissions and fees; 
 An increase of 17.5 million was driven by Acquisition-related expense and Acquisition related long-term 
 incentive compensation related to recently completed acquisitions; 
 An increase of 9.1 million was driven by Equity-based compensation expense related to both recent grants as 
 well as modification expense of 4.6 million associated with the removal of equity transfer restrictions for an 
 executive officer of the Company; and 
 The remaining increase of 15.9 million was driven by (i) the addition of 623 employees compared to the 
 same period in the prior year, and (ii) growth in the business. Overall headcount increased to 4,917 full-time 
 employees as of September 30, 2024 , from 4,294 as of September 30, 2023 . 
 The net impact of revenue growth and the factors above resulted in a Compensation and benefits expense ratio decrease of 
 0.6 from 65.6 to 65.0 period-over-period. 
 In general, we expect to continue experiencing a rise in commissions, salaries, incentives, and benefits expense 
 commensurate with our expected growth in business volume, revenue, and headcount. 

44 

General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense increased by 19.4 million , or 28.0 , from 69.3 million to 88.7 million for the three 
 months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The following were the principal 
 drivers of this increase: 
 6.8 million of increased Acquisition-related expense associated with recent and prospective acquisitions; and 
 12.6 million was driven by growth in the business. Such expenses incurred to accommodate both organic and 
 inorganic revenue growth include IT, travel and entertainment, occupancy, and insurance. 
 The net impact of revenue growth and the factors listed above resulted in a General and administrative expense ratio 
 increase of 0.9 from 13.8 to 14.7 period-over-period. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization expense increased by 9.6 million , or 32.5 , from 29.6 million to 39.2 million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The main driver of the increase was the amortization of 
 intangible assets from recent acquisitions. Our intangible assets increased by 760.8 million when comparing the balance 
 as of September 30, 2024 , to the balance as of September 30, 2023 . 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased 17.9 million , or 56.8 , from 31.5 million to 49.4 million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The main driver of the increase in Interest expense, net 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , was an increase in debt from recent acquisition activity. For the three 
 months ended September 30, 2024 , the reduction to Interest expense, net related to our interest rate cap was 5.0 million. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the reduction to Interest expense, net related to interest income 
 earned on operating cash balances of 5.7 million and 7.1 million, respectively. 
 Other Non-Operating Loss 
 Other non-operating loss increased by 16.5 million to a loss of 16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 
 2024 , as compared to a loss of 0.1 million in the same period in the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 
 2024 , Other non-operating loss consisted of 16.2 million of term loan modification expense and 0.5 million of TRA 
 contractual interest and related charges offset by 0.1 million of sublease income. For the three months ended 
 September 30, 2023 , Other non-operating income included 0.3 million of TRA contractual interest and related charges 
 offset by 0.2 million of sublease income. 
 Income Before Income Taxes 
 Income before income taxes decreased 20.8 million from 40.5 million to 19.7 million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the factors described above. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Income tax expense (benefit) decreased 33.8 million from expense of 24.8 million to a benefit of 9.0 million for the 
 three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of 20.7 
 million of income tax expense recognized as a result of the Common Control Reorganization CCR subsequent to the 
 Socius acquisition in the third quarter of 2023 and a 10.9 million income tax benefit recognized as a result of Equity- 
 based compensation awards vesting in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Net Income 
 Net income increased 12.9 million from 15.7 million to 28.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the factors described above.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue 
 Total Revenue 
 Total revenue increased by 307.5 million , or 19.9 , from 1,544.7 million to 1,852.2 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The following were the principal drivers of the 
 increase: 
 196.1 million, or 12.7 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to organic revenue 
 growth. Organic revenue growth represents the change in Net commissions and fees revenue, as compared to 
 the same period for the year prior, adjusted for Net commissions and fees attributable to recent acquisitions 
 during the first twelve months of Ryan Specialty s ownership, and other adjustments such as the removal of the 
 impact of contingent commissions and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. In aggregate, our net 
 commission rates were consistent period-over-period. Also, we grew our client relationships, in aggregate, 
 within each of our three Specialties. The growth of these relationships is due to the combination of a growing 
 E S market and winning new business from competitors. Growth in the quarter was balanced across our 
 property and casualty portfolios within our three Specialties, driven by an increase in the flow of risks into the 
 E S market; 
 87.7 million, or 5.7 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to the acquisitions of 
 AccuRisk, Castel, US Assure, Greenhill, and Ethos P C, all of which were completed within twelve months of 
 September 30, 2024 ; 
 14.6 million, or 0.9 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to changes in contingent 
 commissions and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the Company s Net commissions and fees; and 
 9.1 million, or 0.6 , of the period-over-period change in Total revenue was due to an increase in Fiduciary 
 investment income, caused by a rise in interest rates and a rise in fiduciary balances compared to the prior year.

Net commissions and policy fees grew 18.8 , in line with the overall net commissions and fee revenue growth of 19.8 
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The main drivers of this 
 growth continue to be the acquisition of new business and expansion of ongoing client relationships in response to the 
 increasing demand for new, complex E S products as well as the inflow of risks from the Admitted market into the E S 
 market and an increase in the premium rate for risks placed. In aggregate, we experienced stable commission rates period- 
 over-period. 
 Supplemental and contingent commissions increased 26.7 period-over-period driven by the performance of risks placed 
 on eligible business earning profit-based or volume-based commissions. 
 Loss mitigation and other fees increased 67.8 period-over-period primarily due increased capital markets activity, certain 
 fees related to the ACE, Point6, and AccuRisk acquisitions completed in the second half of 2023, and captive management 
 and other risk management service fees from the placement of alternative risk insurance solutions. 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 Compensation and benefits expense increased by 191.5 million , or 19.4 , from 989.3 million to 1,180.8 million for the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023 . The following were the principal drivers of 
 this increase: 
 Commissions increased 73.3 million, or 15.9 , period-over-period, driven by the 19.8 increase in Net 
 commissions and fees; 
 An increase of 22.3 million was driven by Restructuring and related expense associated with the 
 ACCELERATE 2025 program; 
 An increase of 17.2 million was driven by Acquisition-related expense and Acquisition related long-term 
 incentive compensation related to recently completed acquisitions; 
 An increase of 16.6 million was driven by Equity-based compensation expense related to both recent grants 
 as well as modification expense of 4.6 million associated with the removal of equity transfer restrictions for 
 an executive officer of the Company; and 
 The remaining increase of 62.1 million was driven by (i) the addition of 623 employees compared to the 
 same period in the prior year, and (ii) growth in the business. Overall headcount increased to 4,917 full-time 
 employees as of September 30, 2024 , from 4,294 as of September 30, 2023 . 
 The net impact of revenue growth and the factors above resulted in a Compensation and benefits expense ratio decrease of 
 0.2 from 64.0 to 63.8 period-over-period. 
 In general, we expect to continue experiencing a rise in commissions, salaries, incentives, and benefits expense 
 commensurate with our expected growth in business volume, revenue, and headcount. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense increased by 44.9 million , or 22.2 , from 202.6 million to 247.5 million for the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The following were the principal 
 drivers of this increase: 
 32.9 million was driven by growth in the business. Such expenses incurred to accommodate both organic and 
 inorganic revenue growth include IT, travel and entertainment, occupancy, and insurance; 
 23.6 million of increased acquisition-related expense associated with recent and prospective acquisitions; and 
 These increases were partially offset by an 11.6 million decline in Restructuring and related expense 
 associated with ACCELERATE 2025. 
 The net impact of revenue growth and the factors listed above resulted in a General and administrative expense ratio 
 increase of 0.3 from 13.1 to 13.4 period-over-period. 

47 

Amortization 
 Amortization expense increased by 18.6 million , or 23.5 , from 79.1 million to 97.7 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The main driver of the increase was the amortization of 
 intangible assets from recent acquisitions. Our intangible assets increased by 760.8 million when comparing the balance 
 as of September 30, 2024 , to the balance as of September 30, 2023 . 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased 20.1 million , or 22.3 , from 89.8 million to 109.9 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The main driver of the increase in Interest expense, net 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , was an increase in debt from recent acquisition activity. For the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2024 , the reduction to Interest expense, net related to our interest rate cap was 14.5 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023 , the reduction to Interest expense, net related to interest income 
 earned on operating cash balances was 19.0 million and 23.0 million, respectively. 
 Other Non-Operating Loss 
 Other non-operating loss increased by 18.5 million to a loss of 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 , as compared to a de minimis loss in the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 , Other non-operating loss consisted of 18.1 million of expense related to term loan modifications and 0.8 million of 
 TRA contractual interest and related charges offset by 0.4 million of sublease income. For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2023 , Other non-operating loss included 0.5 million of TRA contractual interest and related charges offset 
 by 0.4 million of sublease income.

 Income tax expense (benefit) decreased 26.6 million from 42.8 million to 16.2 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of 20.7 million of income tax 
 expense recognized as a result of the CCR subsequent to the Socius acquisition in the third quarter of 2023 and 10.9 
 million of income tax benefit recognized as a result of Equity-based compensation awards vesting in the third quarter of 
 2024. 
 Net Income

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we use non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from our consolidated 
 financial information, but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with 
 GAAP. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors to facilitate 
 operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital 
 structures, tax positions, depreciation, amortization, and certain other items that we believe are not representative of our 
 core business. We use the following non-GAAP measures for business planning purposes, in measuring our performance 
 relative to that of our competitors, to help investors to understand the nature of our growth, and to enable investors to 
 evaluate the run-rate performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, 
 and not as an alternative or substitute for, the consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with 
 GAAP. The footnotes to the reconciliation tables below should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated 
 quarterly financial statements. Industry peers may provide similar supplemental information but may not define similarly 
 named metrics in the same way we do and may not make identical adjustments. 
 Organic Revenue Growth Rate 
 Organic Revenue Growth Rate is defined as the percentage change in Net commissions and fees, as compared to the same 
 period for the prior year, adjusted to eliminate revenue attributable to acquisitions for the first twelve months of ownership, 
 and other items such as contingent commissions and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 

48 

For the avoidance of doubt, prior period references in the tables below represent the same period in the prior year. A 
 reconciliation of Organic revenue growth rate to Net commissions and fees growth rate, the most directly comparable 
 GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated is as follows (in percentages):

 Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense and Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense Ratio 
 We define Adjusted compensation and benefits expense as Compensation and benefits expense adjusted to reflect items 
 such as (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) acquisition and restructuring related compensation expense, and (iii) other 
 exceptional or non-recurring items, as applicable. The most comparable GAAP financial metric is Compensation and 
 benefits expense. Adjusted compensation and benefits expense ratio is defined as Adjusted compensation and benefits 
 expense as a percentage of Total revenue. The most comparable GAAP financial metric is Compensation and benefits 
 expense ratio.

(1) Adjustments to General and administrative expense are described in the definition of Adjusted EBITDAC to Net 
 income in Adjusted EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC Margin. 
 Adjusted EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC Margin 
 We define Adjusted EBITDAC as Net income before Interest expense, net, Income tax expense (benefit), Depreciation, 
 Amortization, and Change in contingent consideration, adjusted to reflect items such as (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) 
 acquisition and restructuring related expenses, and (iii) other exceptional or non-recurring items, as applicable. 
 Acquisition-related expense includes one-time diligence, transaction-related, and integration costs. In 2024 , Acquisition- 
 related expense includes a 4.5 million charge for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , related to a deal-contingent 

50 

foreign exchange forward contract associated with the Castel acquisition. The remaining charges in both years represent 
 typical one-time diligence, transaction-related, and integration costs. Acquisition-related long-term incentive compensation 
 arises from changes to long-term incentive plans associated with acquisitions. Restructuring and related expense consists of 
 compensation and benefits, occupancy, contractors, professional services, and license fees related to the ACCELERATE 
 2025 program. The compensation and benefits expense included severance as well as employment costs related to services 
 rendered between the notification and termination dates and other termination payments. See Note 4 , Restructuring of the 
 unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements for further discussion of ACCELERATE 2025. The remaining costs 
 that preceded the restructuring plan were associated with professional services costs related to program design and 
 licensing costs. Amortization and expense is composed of charges related to discontinued prepaid incentive programs. For 
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 , Other non-operating loss was composed of 16.2 million of expense related to 
 a term loan modification and 0.5 million of TRA contractual interest and related charges offset by 0.1 million of sublease 
 income. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 , Other non-operating loss included 0.3 million of TRA 
 contractual interest and related charges offset by 0.2 million of sublease income. For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , Other non-operating loss consisted of 18.1 million of expense related to term loan modifications and 
 0.8 million of TRA contractual interest and related charges offset by 0.4 million of sublease income. For the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2023 , Other non-operating loss included 0.5 million of TRA contractual interest and related charges 
 offset by 0.4 million of sublease income. Equity-based compensation reflects non-cash equity-based expense. For the 
 three months ended September 30, 2024, Equity-based compensation included 4.6 million of expense associated with the 
 removal of equity transfer restrictions for an executive officer of the Company. IPO related expenses include 
 compensation-related expense primarily related to the expense for new awards issued at IPO as well as expense related to 
 the revaluation of existing equity awards at IPO. 
 Total revenue less Adjusted compensation and benefits expense and Adjusted general and administrative expense is 
 equivalent to Adjusted EBITDAC. For a breakout of compensation and general and administrative costs for each addback, 
 refer to the Adjusted compensation and benefits expense and Adjusted general and administrative expense tables above. 
 The most directly comparable GAAP financial metric to Adjusted EBITDAC is Net income. Adjusted EBITDAC margin is 
 defined as Adjusted EBITDAC as a percentage of Total revenue. The most comparable GAAP financial metric is Net 
 income margin. 
 A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC margin to Net income and Net income margin, the most 
 directly comparable GAAP measures, for each of the periods indicated is as follows:

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Margin 
 We define Adjusted net income as tax-effected earnings before amortization and certain items of income and expense, 
 gains and losses, equity-based compensation, acquisition related long-term incentive compensation, acquisition-related 
 expenses, costs associated with the IPO, and certain exceptional or non-recurring items. The most comparable GAAP 
 financial metric is Net income. Adjusted net income margin is calculated as Adjusted net income as a percentage of Total 
 revenue. The most comparable GAAP financial metric is Net income margin. 
 Following the IPO, the Company is subject to United States federal income taxes, in addition to state, local, and foreign 
 taxes, with respect to our allocable share of any net taxable income of the LLC. For comparability purposes, this 
 calculation incorporates the impact of federal and state statutory tax rates on 100 of our adjusted pre-tax income as if the 
 Company owned 100 of the LLC. 
 A reconciliation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income margin to Net income and Net income margin, the most 
 directly comparable GAAP measures, for each of the periods indicated is as follows:

(1) Interest expense, net includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. 
 (2) Adjustments to Net income are described in the definition of Adjusted EBITDAC to Net income in Adjusted 
 EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC Margin. 
 (3) The Company is subject to United States federal income taxes, in addition to state, local, and foreign taxes, with respect 
 to our allocable share of any net taxable income of the LLC. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 this calculation of adjusted income tax expense is based on a federal statutory rate of 21 and a combined state income 
 tax rate net of federal benefits of 5.12 on 100 of our adjusted income before income taxes as if the Company owned 
 100 of the LLC. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , this calculation of adjusted income tax 
 expense is based on a federal statutory rate of 21 and a combined state income tax rate net of federal benefits of 
 4.53 on 100 of our adjusted income before income taxes as if the Company owned 100 of the LLC. 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 We define Adjusted diluted earnings per share as Adjusted net income divided by diluted shares outstanding after adjusting 
 for the effect if 100 of the outstanding LLC Common Units (together with the shares of Class B common stock), vested 

52 

Class C Incentive Units, and unvested equity awards were exchanged into shares of Class A common stock as if 100 of 
 unvested equity awards were vested. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metric is Diluted earnings per share.

(1) Adjustment removes the impact of Net income attributed to dilutive awards and substantively vested RSUs to arrive at 
 Net income attributable to Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , this 
 removes 8.3 million and (0.1) million of Net income (loss), respectively, on 272.7 million and 115.9 million 
 Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted, respectively. For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , this removes 78.3 million and 3.8 million of Net income, respectively, on 271.3 
 million and 124.9 million Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted, respectively. See 
 Note 10 , Earnings Per Share of the unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements. 
 (2) For comparability purposes, this calculation incorporates the Net income that would be distributable if all LLC 
 Common Units (together with shares of Class B common stock) and vested Class C Incentive units were exchanged for 
 shares of Class A common stock. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , this includes 11.1 million 
 and 20.8 million of Net income, respectively, on 272.7 million and 257.6 million Weighted-average shares of Class A 
 common stock outstanding - diluted, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , this 
 includes 106.4 million and 97.8 million of Net income, respectively, on 271.3 million and 267.9 million Weighted- 
 average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 
 2023 , 141.7 million weighted average outstanding LLC Common Units were considered dilutive and included in the 
 257.6 million Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted within Diluted EPS. For the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2023 , 143.0 million weighted average outstanding LLC Common Units were 
 considered dilutive and included in the 267.9 million Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - 
 diluted within Diluted EPS. See Note 10 , Earnings Per Share of the unaudited quarterly consolidated financial 
 statements. 
 (3) Adjustments to Adjusted net income are described in the footnotes of the reconciliation of Adjusted net income to Net 
 income in Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Margin on 272.7 million and 257.6 million Weighted- 
 average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 
 2023 , respectively, and on 271.3 million and 267.9 million Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock 
 outstanding- diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 (4) For comparability purposes and to be consistent with the treatment of the adjustments to arrive at Adjusted net income, 
 the dilutive effect of unvested equity awards is calculated using the treasury stock method as if the weighted-average 
 unrecognized cost associated with the awards was 0 over the period, less any unvested equity awards determined to be 
 dilutive within the Diluted EPS calculation disclosed in Note 10 , Earnings Per Share of the unaudited quarterly 

53 

consolidated financial statements. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , 3.5 million and 15.1 
 million shares were added to the calculation, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , 4.4 
 million were added to the calculation. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business 
 operations. We believe that the balance sheet and strong cash flow profile of our business provides adequate liquidity. The 
 primary sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, cash flows provided by 
 operations, and debt capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, and Senior Secured Notes. The 
 primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, seasonal working capital needs, business combinations, capital 
 expenditures, obligations under the TRA, taxes, distributions to LLC Unitholders, and dividends to Class A common 
 stockholders. We believe that Cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and amounts available under our 
 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt 
 obligations, capital expenditures, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the next 12 months and beyond. Our 
 future capital requirements will depend on many factors including continuance of historical working capital levels and 
 capital expenditure needs, investment in de novo offerings, and the flow of deals in our merger and acquisition program. 
 On February 27, 2024 , our Board declared a one-time special cash dividend of 0.23 per share on our outstanding Class A 
 common stock. In addition, the Board initiated a regular quarterly dividend of 0.11 per share on our outstanding Class A 
 common stock. The special dividend of 0.23 and 0.07 of the regular quarterly dividend were funded by current and prior 
 tax distributions from the LLC that are in excess of both the corporate income taxes payable by the Company as well as the 
 Company s obligations pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The remaining 0.04 of the regular quarterly dividend 
 was funded by free cash flow from the LLC and paid to all holders of the Class A common stock and LLC Common Units. 
 We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from 
 outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital 
 or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations, this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm 
 the results of our operations. 
 Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include funds available for general corporate purposes. 
 Fiduciary cash and receivables cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Insurance premiums, claims funds, and 
 surplus lines taxes are held in a fiduciary capacity and the obligation to remit these funds are recorded as Fiduciary 
 liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize fiduciary amounts due to others as Fiduciary liabilities and 
 fiduciary amounts collectible and held on behalf of others, including insurance carriers, other insurance intermediaries, 
 surplus lines taxing authorities, clients, and insurance policy holders, as Fiduciary cash and receivables on the Consolidated 
 Balance Sheets. 
 In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, 
 remit the premiums to the respective insurance markets and carriers. We also collect claims prefunding or refunds from 
 carriers on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds, and surplus lines taxes, which are then remitted to 
 surplus lines taxing authorities. Insurance premiums, claims funds, and surplus lines taxes are held in a fiduciary capacity. 
 The levels of Fiduciary cash and receivables and Fiduciary liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we 
 collect the premiums, claims prefunding, and refunds, make payments to markets, carriers, surplus lines taxing authorities, 
 and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency 
 movements. Fiduciary cash, because of its nature, is generally invested in very liquid securities with a focus on 
 preservation of principal. To minimize investment risk, we maintain cash holdings pursuant to an investment policy which 
 contemplates all relevant rules established by states with regard to fiduciary cash and is approved by our Board of 
 Directors. The policy requires broad diversification of holdings across a variety of counterparties utilizing limits set by our 
 Board of Directors, primarily based on credit rating and type of investment. Fiduciary cash and receivables included cash 
 of 1,120.9 million and 848.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and fiduciary receivables of 
 2,236.1 million and 1,672.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. While we may earn interest 
 income on fiduciary cash held in cash and investments, the fiduciary cash may not be used for general corporate purposes. 
 Of the 235.2 million of Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 , 74.7 
 million was held in fiduciary accounts representing collected revenue and was available to be transferred to operating 
 accounts and used for general corporate purposes. 
 Credit Facilities 
 We expect to have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months. Although cash 
 from operations is expected to be sufficient to service our activities, including servicing our debt and contractual 
 obligations, and financing capital expenditures, we have the ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility to 

54 

accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we 
 could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed. 
 On September 1, 2020 , we entered into the Credit Agreement with leading institutions, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
 N.A., the Administrative Agent, for Term Loan borrowings totaling 1,650.0 million and a Revolving Credit Facility 
 totaling 300.0 million , in connection with financing the acquisition of All Risks, Ltd. Borrowings under our Revolving 
 Credit Facility are permitted to be drawn for our working capital and other general corporate financing purposes and those 
 of certain of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by various 
 subsidiaries and are secured by a lien and security interest in substantially all of our assets. 
 On July 26, 2021 , we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement, which provided for an increase in the size of 
 our Revolving Credit Facility from 300.0 million to 600.0 million . Interest on the upsized Revolving Credit Facility bore 
 interest at the Eurocurrency Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranged from 2.50 to 3.00 , based on the first lien net 
 leverage ratio defined in our Credit Agreement. No other significant terms under our agreement governing the Revolving 
 Credit Facility were changed in connection with such amendment. 
 On February 3, 2022 , the LLC issued 400.0 million of 8-year Senior Secured Notes. The notes have a 4.375 interest rate 
 and will mature on February 1, 2030 . 
 On April 29, 2022, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement on our Term Loan and Revolving 
 Credit Facility to transition its LIBOR rate to a Benchmark Replacement of Adjusted Term SOFR plus a Credit Spread 
 Adjustment of 10 basis points, 15 basis points, or 25 basis points for the one-month, three-month, or six-month borrowing 
 periods, respectively. 
 On January 19, 2024 , we entered into the Fifth Amendment (the Repricing Amendment to the Term Loan s Credit 
 Agreement. As a result of the Repricing Amendment, the applicable interest rate of the Term Loan was reduced from 
 Adjusted Term SOFR + 3.00 to Adjusted Term SOFR + 2.25 and no longer contains a credit spread adjustment. All 
 other material provisions remain unchanged. 
 On July 30, 2024, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided for an 
 increase in borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from 600.0 million to 1,400.0 million. The 
 amendment also extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to July 30, 2029, and reduced the applicable 
 interest rate from Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 2.50 to 3.00 to Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 2.00 
 to 2.50 , based on the first lien net leverage ratio defined in the Credit Agreement. 
 On September 13, 2024, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which refinanced the 
 existing Term Loan in the aggregate principal amount of 1,588.1 million outstanding as of June 30, 2024, and increased 
 the size of the Term Loan by 111.9 million to 1,700.0 million as of September 30, 2024. In addition to increasing the 
 size of the Term Loan, the Seventh Amendment reduced the applicable interest rate of the Term Loan from Adjusted Term 
 SOFR plus a margin of 2.75 to Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 2.25 and lowered the 75 basis point floor on 
 Adjusted Term SOFR to a 0 basis point floor. Upon achievement of a stable (or better) corporate family rating from 
 Moody s of Ba3 or better, the applicable interest rate of the Term Loan will be revised to Adjusted Term SOFR plus a 
 margin of 2.00 . 
 On September 19, 2024, the LLC issued 600.0 million of 8-year Senior Secured Notes. These notes carry a 5.875 
 interest rate and will mature on August 1, 2032. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.25 plus Adjusted Term SOFR. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement and there 
 were no events of default for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 The Company is party to a TRA with current and certain former LLC Unitholders. The TRA provides for the payment by 
 the Company, to current and certain former LLC Unitholders, of 85 of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, 
 and local income taxes that the Company realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) certain 
 increases in the tax basis of the assets of the LLC resulting from purchases or exchanges of LLC Common Units 
 Exchange Tax Attributes ), (ii) certain tax attributes of the LLC that existed prior to the IPO Pre-IPO M A Tax 
 Attributes ), (iii) certain favorable remedial partnership tax allocations to which the Company becomes entitled to (if 
 any), and (iv) certain other tax benefits related to the Company entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to 

55 

payments that the Company makes under the TRA TRA Payment Tax Attributes ). The Company recognizes a liability 
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the undiscounted estimated future payments under the TRA. 
 Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot precisely quantify the likely tax benefits we will realize as a result of 
 the LLC Common Unit exchanges and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to current and certain former LLC 
 Unitholders pursuant to the TRA; however, we estimate that such tax benefits and the related TRA payments may be 
 substantial. As set forth in the table below, and assuming no changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient 
 taxable income to realize all cash tax savings that are subject to the TRA, we expect future payments under the TRA as a 
 result of transactions as of September 30, 2024 will be 455.1 million in aggregate. Future payments in respect to 
 subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts and are expected to be substantial. The foregoing amounts are 
 merely estimates and the actual payments could differ materially. In the highly unlikely event of an early termination of the 
 TRA (e.g., a default by the Company or a Change of Control) the Company is required to pay to each holder of the TRA an 
 early termination payment equal to the discounted present value of all unpaid TRA payments. The Company has not made, 
 and is not likely to make, an election for an early termination. We expect to fund future TRA payments with tax 
 distributions from the LLC that come from cash on hand and cash generated from operations.

Total expected estimated tax savings from each of the tax attributes associated with the TRA as of September 30, 2024 , 
 were 535.4 million consisting of (i) Exchange Tax Attributes of 310.1 million , (ii) Pre-IPO M A Tax Attributes of

 Comparison of Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 519.2 million from 754.4 million at September 30, 2023 , to 235.2 million at 
 September 30, 2024 . A summary of the Company s cash flows provided by and used for continuing operations from 
 operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows: 
 Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were 255.2 million , an 
 increase of 4.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This increase in cash flows provided by 
 operating activities was driven by an increase in Net income of 51.4 million , an increase of 18.6 million in Amortization, 
 and an increase of 16.3 million in Prepaid and deferred compensation expense offset by the change in Other current and 
 non-current assets and Other current and non-current accrued liabilities of 84.3 million and Deferred income tax expense 
 (benefit) decline of 34.4 million. The change in Other current and non-current accrued liabilities was primarily driven by 
 an increase in acquisition contingent consideration payments. The change in Deferred income tax expense (benefit) was 
 driven by 20.7 million of Deferred income tax expense from reorganization related to the CCR subsequent to the Socius 
 acquisition in the third quarter of 2023 and 10.9 million of Deferred income tax benefit recognized as a result of Equity- 
 based compensation award vesting recognized in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Cash Flows From Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were 1,286.4 million , an 
 increase of 904.5 million compared to the 381.9 million of cash flows used for investing activities during the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2023 . The main driver of the cash flows used for investing activities in the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 was 1,256.7 million for Business combinations - net of cash acquired and cash held in a fiduciary 
 capacity and 29.7 million of Capital expenditures, compared to 366.1 million for Business combinations - net of cash 
 acquired and cash held in a fiduciary capacity and 16.0 million of Capital expenditures for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2023 . 

56 

Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were 625.3 million , an 
 increase of 657.3 million compared to cash flows used in financing activities of 32.0 million during the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2023 . The main drivers of cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 were Proceeds from Senior Secured Notes of 595.2 million , Proceeds from term debt of 107.6 
 million, and Net change in fiduciary liabilities of 90.7 million offset by Dividends paid to Class A common shareholders 
 of 66.5 million , Tax distributions to non-controlling LLC Unitholders of 65.8 million , Debt issuance costs paid of 16.8 
 million , Distributions to non-controlling LLC Unitholders of 16.8 million , Repayment of term debt of 8.3 million , and 
 Payment of accrued return on Ryan Re preferred units of 2.0 million . The main drivers of cash flows used in by financing 
 activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , were Tax distributions to non-controlling LLC Unitholders of 
 52.6 million , Repayment of term debt of 12.4 million , and the Payment of contingent consideration of 4.5 million offset 
 by the Net change in fiduciary liabilities of 36.8 million . 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our principal commitments consist of contractual obligations in connection with investing and operating activities. These 
 obligations are described within Note 7 , Debt in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, where we 
 provide further description on provisions that create, increase, or accelerate obligations, or other pertinent data to the extent 
 necessary for an understanding of the timing and amount of the specified contractual obligations. 
 Within Current accrued compensation and Non-current accrued compensation we have various long-term incentive 
 compensation agreements accrued for. These agreements are typically associated with an acquisition. Below we have 
 outlined the liabilities accrued as of September 30, 2024 , the projected future expense, and the projected timing of future 
 cash outflows associated with these arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying the accounting policies may require us to apply 
 judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if (i) 
 the Company must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made and (ii) changes in the estimate 
 assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and 
 the results that we will report in the consolidated financial statements. While we believe that the estimates, assumptions, 
 and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made. The accounting 
 policies that we believe reflect our more significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are most critical to 
 understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are: revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill and 
 intangibles, income taxes, and tax receivable agreement liabilities. 
 Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
 Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
 ended December 31, 2023 , filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 . Additionally, the changes, if any, to our critical 
 accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , are 
 included in Note 1 , Basis of Presentation , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 
 (if any), see Note 1 , Basis of Presentation in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to various market risks in our day-to-day operations. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse 
 changes in market rates and prices, such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , approximately 4 of revenues were generated from activities in the 
 United Kingdom, Europe, and Canada. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes between the exchange 
 rates of the US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Swedish Krona, Danish Krone, and other European 
 currencies. The exposure to foreign currency risk from the potential changes between the exchange of USD and other 
 currencies is immaterial. 
 Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk 
 Certain of the Company s revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. 
 Interest rate risk and credit risk to counterparties generated from the Company s Cash and cash equivalents, and Cash and 
 cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, will fluctuate with the general level of interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had 1,700.0 million of outstanding principal on our Term Loan borrowings, which bears 
 interest on a floating rate, subject to a 0.0 floor. We are subject to Adjusted Term SOFR interest rate changes and 
 exposure in excess of the floor. The fair value of the Term Loan approximates the carrying amount as of September 30, 
 2024 and December 31, 2023 , as determined based upon information available. 
 On April 7, 2022 , the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rate 
 fluctuations related to the Company s Term Loan for an upfront cost of 25.5 million . The interest rate cap has a 1,000.0 
 million notional amount, 2.75 strike, and terminates on December 31, 2025 .

Based on the below balances as of September 30, 2024 , the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point (BPS) increase or 
 decrease in quarter-end prevailing short-term interest rates for one year would be:

(1) To the extent SOFR falls below 0.0 , the impact of the change in interest rates is zero. 
 (2) To the extent interest rates fall below 2.75 , the impact of the change in interest rates is zero. 
 In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary cash holdings are subject to potential loss of value due 
 to counterparty credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries hold funds pursuant to an investment 
 policy approved by our Board. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad 
 diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company 
 carefully monitors its cash, cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, and plans to 
 further restrict the portfolio as appropriate with respect to market conditions. The majority of Cash and cash equivalents 
 and Cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity are held in demand deposit accounts and short-term investments, 
 consisting principally of AAA-rated money market funds and treasury bills, having original maturities of 90 days or less. 
 Other financial instruments consist of Cash and cash equivalents, Commissions and fees receivable net, Other current 
 assets, and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts of Cash and cash equivalents, Commissions and 
 fees receivable net, and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term nature 
 of the instruments. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Securities 
 Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that 
 information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is 
 recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure 
 controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that 
 information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is 
 accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as 
 appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive 
 officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024 , our disclosure controls and procedures 
 were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , that 
 have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as 
 specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect 
 all errors and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and 

59 

can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can 
 provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of 
 fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course 
 of business. Although the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, we are not presently a 
 party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken 
 together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our annual report on 
 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 .

 definitions. 
 First Lien Obligations any Indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Liens 
 that secure the Initial Term Loans, the Revolving Loans (if any) and the Revolving Commitments (or any 
 refinancing of the Initial Term Loans, Revolving Loans (if any) or Revolving Commitments with loans or 
 commitments having the same Lien priority as the Initial Term Loans, Revolving Loans (if any) or 
 Revolving Commitments, as applicable, prior to such refinancing). For the avoidance of doubt, First 
 Lien Obligations shall include the Initial Term Loans, Revolving Loans (if any) or Revolving 
 Commitments (or the loans or commitments that Refinance the Initial Term Loans, Revolving Loans (if 
 any) or Revolving Commitments).

 Priority Refinancing Debt.

 Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for any period, the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA for such 
 period to the Fixed Charges for such period. In the event that the Borrower or any of the Restricted 
 Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems (or gives irrevocable notice of redemption for), retires 
 or extinguishes any Indebtedness (other than in the case of revolving advances under any Qualified 

45 

Receivables Financing in which case interest expense shall be computed based upon the average daily 
 balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period) or issues or redeems (or gives irrevocable 
 notice of redemption for) Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the 
 period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with 
 the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the Fixed Charge 
 Coverage Ratio Calculation Date ), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro 
 forma effect to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption (including as contemplated by any 
 such irrevocable notice of redemption), retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or 
 redemption (including as contemplated by any such irrevocable notice of redemption) of Disqualified 
 Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter 
 period. 
 For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments (including any 
 designation of a Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary), acquisitions, 
 dispositions, mergers (including the Transactions), consolidations and disposed or discontinued 
 operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), in each case with respect to an operating unit of a 
 business, and Operational Changes that the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries has both 
 determined to make and made after the Closing Date and during the four-quarter reference period or 
 subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or substantially simultaneously with the 
 Calculation Date (each, for purposes of this definition, a pro forma event shall be calculated on a Pro 
 Forma Basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers (including the 
 Transactions), consolidations, Operational Changes and discontinued operations (and the change of any 
 associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had 
 occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If, since the beginning of such period, any 
 Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Borrower or any 
 Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period shall have made or effected any Investment, 
 acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation or discontinued operation, in each case with respect to an 
 operating unit of a business, or Operational Changes that would have required adjustment pursuant to this 
 definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for 
 such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, discontinued operation 
 or Operational Changes had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. 
 For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, 
 the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of 
 the Borrower to the extent identifiable and supportable. Any such pro forma calculation may include, 
 without duplication, adjustments appropriate to reflect cost savings, operating expense reductions, 
 restructuring charges and expenses and synergies reasonably expected to result from the applicable event 
 to the extent set forth in the definition of Consolidated EBITDA . 
 If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the 
 interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage 
 Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging

 Secured Net Leverage Ratio and or the Total Net Leverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the Fixed 
 Amounts substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or 
 consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Loan Documents under the same covenant that requires 
 compliance with a financial ratio or test (including a test based on the Fixed Charge Interest Coverage 
 Ratio, the Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio and or the Total Net 
 Leverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the Incurrence-Based Amounts ), it is understood and agreed that 
 (a) the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the 
 Incurrence-Based Amounts, and (b) except as provided in clause (a), the entire transaction shall be 
 calculated on a Pro Forma Basis. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, any Indebtedness (and 
 associated Liens, subject to the applicable priorities required pursuant to the applicable Incurrence-Based 
 Amounts), Investments, liquidations, dissolutions, mergers, consolidations, dividends, or any 
 prepayments of Indebtedness incurred or otherwise effected in reliance on Fixed Amounts may be 
 reclassified at any time, as the Borrower may elect from time to time, as incurred under the applicable 
 Incurrence-Based Amounts if the Borrower together with the Restricted Subsidiaries subsequently meets 
 the applicable ratio for such Incurrence-Based Amounts on a Pro Forma Basis. Notwithstanding the 
 foregoing, Revolving Borrowings are not Fixed Amounts. 
 1.6 Currency Equivalents Generally. 
 (a) The Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as applicable, shall determine 
 the Dollar Equivalent of any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit as of each date (with such date to be 
 reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent) that is on or about the date of each request for the 
 issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, using the 
 Exchange Rate for the applicable currency in relation to Dollars in effect on the date of determination, 
 and each such amount shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such Letter of Credit until the next required 
 calculation thereof pursuant to this Section 1.6(a) . 
 (b) The Dollar Equivalent of any L C Borrowing made by any Issuing Lender in 
 any Alternative Currency and not reimbursed by the Borrower shall be determined as set forth in 
 Section 3.5 . In addition, the Dollar Equivalent of the L C Exposure shall be determined as set forth in 
 Section 3.9 , at the time and in the circumstances specified therein. 
 (c) The Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lenders, as applicable, shall notify the 
 Borrower, the applicable Lenders and the applicable Issuing Lender of each calculation of the Dollar 
 Equivalent of each Letter of Credit denominated in any Alternative Currency and each Borrowing in any 
 Alternative Currency. 
 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with 
 Sections 7.2 , 7.3 and 7.6 with respect to any amount of Indebtedness or Investment in a currency other 
 than Dollars, no Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of 
 exchange occurring after the time such Lien, Indebtedness or Investment is incurred provided that, for 
 the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.6 shall otherwise apply to such 
 Sections, including with respect to determining whether any Indebtedness or Investment may be incurred 
 at any time under such Sections. 

103 

(e) For purposes of determining compliance under Sections 7.5 and 7.6 , any amount 
 in a currency other than Dollars will be converted to Dollars in a manner consistent with that used in 
 calculating net income in the Borrower s annual financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 
 6.1(a) provided , however , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to apply to the determination of any 
 amount of Indebtedness. 
 (f) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence 
 of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign 
 currency shall be calculated based on the Exchange Rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was 
 incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt provided that if 
 such Indebtedness is incurred to extend, replace, refund, refinance, renew or defease other Indebtedness 
 denominated in a foreign currency, and such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or 
 defeasance would cause the applicable restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency 
 exchange rate in effect on the date of such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or 
 defeasance, such restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount 
 of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being 
 extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed or defeased. 
 1.7 Treatment of Subsidiaries Prior to Joinder. Each Subsidiary of the Borrower that is 
 required to be joined as a Loan Party pursuant to Section 6.9 shall, until the completion of such joinder, 
 be deemed for the purposes of Section 7 of this Agreement to be a Loan Party from and after the Closing 
 Date (or the date of formation or acquisition of such subsidiary). 
 1.8 Interest Rates. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.16 
 provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will 
 promptly notify the applicable parties as and when required by Section 2.16, of any change to the 
 reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based. Except as otherwise provided 
 in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall 
 not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the 
 London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate or with respect to 
 any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any 
 such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.16 , whether upon the 
 occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement 
 Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 2.16) , including without limitation, whether the composition or 
 characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or 
 produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the Eurocurrency Rate or have the same volume or 
 liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability other than, 
 in each case, to the extent of the Administrative Agent s gross negligence, bad faith or wilfull misconduct 
 as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision . Nothing in this 
 Section shall constitute a representation or warranty by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries 
 nor can it constitute the basis of any Default or Event of Default. 
 1.9 Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division 
 or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction s laws) 
 (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability 
 of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the 
 subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to 

104 

have been organized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its equity interests at 
 such time. 
 1.10 Calculation of Baskets. For purposes of determining compliance with any provision of 
 this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (a) in the event that any action or transaction (or any 
 portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of exceptions, thresholds or baskets 
 pursuant to any provision set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Borrower shall, in 
 its sole discretion, at the time of taking such action or consummation of such transaction, divide, classify 
 or reclassify, or at any later time divide, classify or reclassify, such action or transaction as being incurred 
 or taken under one or more such exceptions, thresholds or baskets, including reclassifying any utilization 
 of exceptions, baskets and thresholds that are based on a fixed amount (subject to an Consolidated 
 EBITDA grower amount) (such exceptions, baskets and thresholds, fixed baskets as incurred or 
 taken under any available exception, threshold or basket that is based on the Total First Lien Net 
 Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Interest 
 Coverage Ratio (such exceptions, baskets and thresholds, incurrence-based baskets ), and if any 
 applicable ratios or financial tests for such incurrence-based baskets would be satisfied in any subsequent 
 fiscal quarter, such reclassification shall be deemed to have automatically occurred if not elected by the 
 Borrower and (b) in the event that the Borrower shall classify any action or transaction on any date of 
 determination as incurred or taken, in whole or in part, under any incurrence-based baskets, then any 
 calculation of the Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total 
 Net Leverage Ratio or the Interest Coverage Ratio on such date (but not in respect of any future 
 calculation following such date) shall not include any action or transaction incurred or taken pursuant to 
 one or more fixed baskets.

 Officer of the Borrower no later than 12 00 p.m. Local Time, three (3) Business Days prior to the 
 proposed conversion date. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans made in 
 Dollars to the Borrower to Term Benchmark Loans made in Dollars by giving the Administrative Agent 
 prior irrevocable written notice of such election substantially in the form of Exhibit H or such other form 
 as approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic platform or electronic 
 transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), appropriately completed and 
 signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, no later than 12 00 p.m. (New York City time), on the 
 third Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the 
 initial Interest Period therefor) provided , further, that if the Borrower wishes to request Term Benchmark 
 Loans having an Interest Period other than one, three or six months in duration as provided in the 
 definition of Interest Period, the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not 
 later than 12 00 p.m. (New York City time) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of such 
 Borrowing conversion, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of 
 such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is approved by all of them. Not later 
 than 12 00 p.m. (New York City time), two (2) Business Days before the requested date of such 
 Borrowing conversion, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower whether or not the requested 
 Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders provided , further that, no ABR Loan may be 
 converted into a Term Benchmark Loan made in Dollars when a bankruptcy or payment Event of Default 
 has occurred and is continuing. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly 
 notify each relevant Lender thereof. If the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting any 
 conversion from one Type of Loan to another, then the applicable Loans shall be continued as, or 
 converted to, Term Benchmark Loans made in Dollars with a one-month Interest Period. Any such 
 automatic conversion to ABR Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in 
 effect with respect to the applicable Term Benchmark Loans made in Dollars. 
 (b) Any Term Benchmark Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the 
 then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, 
 giving irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit H or 
 such other form as approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic platform 

113 

or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), appropriately 
 completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower, no later than 2 00 p.m. (New York City 
 time) on the third Business Day preceding the proposed continuation date in the case of Term Benchmark 
 Loans provided , further , that , to the extent the Required Lenders provide written notice thereof to the 
 Borrower, no Term Benchmark Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred 
 and is continuing provided , further , that if the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, shall fail to 
 give any required notice as described above in this paragraph, such Loans shall be automatically 
 continued as Term Benchmark Loans with a one-month Interest Period on the last day of such then 
 expiring Interest Period, and if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso, such 
 Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then-expiring Interest 
 Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant 
 Lender thereof. 
 2.13 Limitations on Term Benchmark Tranches . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
 this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Term Benchmark Loans and all 
 selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, 
 after giving effect thereto, (a) the aggregate principal amount of the Term Benchmark Loans comprising 
 each Term Benchmark Tranche shall be equal to 1,000,000 or a whole multiple of 500,000 in excess 
 thereof, and (b)(i) in the case of Term Loans, no more than five Term Benchmark Tranches shall be 
 outstanding at any one time and (ii) in the case of Revolving Loans, no more than 10 Term Benchmark 
 Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 
 2.14 Interest Rates and Payment Dates . 
 (a) Each Term Benchmark Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest 
 Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted 
 EURIBOR Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. 
 (b) Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the 
 Applicable Margin. 
 (c) Each RFR Revolving Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the 
 applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR plus the Applicable Rate. 
 (d) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement 
 Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such 
 overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate that would otherwise be applicable 
 thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14 plus 2 and (ii) if all or a portion of 
 (x) any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, (y) any Commitment Fee or (z) any 
 other amount payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall not be paid when due (whether 
 at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per 
 annum equal to the rate then applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility plus 2 (or, in the case 
 of any such other amounts that do not relate to a particular Facility, the rate then applicable to ABR Loans 
 under the Revolving Facility plus 2 ), in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the 
 date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). 
 (e) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided that 
 interest accruing pursuant to Section 2.14(d) shall be payable from time to time on demand. 

114 

2.15 Computation of Interest and Fees . 
 (a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 
 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to ABR Loans and RFR Revolving 
 Loans, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year 
 for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower 
 and the relevant Lenders of each determination of an applicable Benchmark. Any change in the interest 
 rate on a Loan resulting from a change in any applicable Benchmark shall become effective as of the 
 opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall 
 as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount 
 of each such change in interest rate. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such 
 Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to an ABR Loan or 
 RFR Revolving Loans, as applicable, being converted from a Term Benchmark Loan, the date of 
 conversion of such Term Benchmark Loan to such ABR Loan or RFR Revolving Loan, as applicable, as 
 the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an 
 Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to an ABR Loan or RFR Revolving Loan, as 
 applicable, being converted to a Term Benchmark Loan, the date of conversion of such ABR Loan or 
 RFR Revolving Loan, as applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, as the case may be, shall be 
 excluded provided that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day s interest shall 
 be paid on that Loan. 
 (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to 
 any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the UK Borrower, 
 as applicable, and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the 
 request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the 
 Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.14 . 
 2.16 Inability to Determine Interest Rate Illegality . 
 (a) If prior to the first day of any Interest Period (i) the Administrative Agent or the 
 Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility shall have determined (which determination 
 shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower and the UK Borrower, as applicable) that, by reason 
 of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for 
 ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate (including because the 
 Relevant EURIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis) for such Interest Period 
 or (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect 
 of the relevant Facility that (A) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, as 
 applicable, determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect 
 the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their 
 affected Loans during such Interest Period or (B) at any time, the applicable Adjusted Simple RFR for 
 Sterling will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintain their Loans 
 included in such Borrowing for Sterling, then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof 
 to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. Thereafter, (x) the obligation 
 of the Lenders to make or maintain Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Revolving Loans shall be suspended 
 and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Adjusted 
 Term SOFR Rate component of the ABR, the utilization of the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component in 
 determining the ABR shall be suspended, in each case until such time as the Administrative Agent (upon 
 the approval of the Majority Facility Lenders which approval the Administrative Agent agrees to seek 
 promptly once it reasonably believes such condition no longer exists) revokes such notice. Upon receipt 

115 

of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or 
 continuation of Term Benchmark Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request 
 into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans in the amount specified therein. 
 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law 
 shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Revolving 
 Loan, as applicable, or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Term 
 Benchmark Loan or RFR Revolving Loan, as applicable, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to 
 the Administrative Agent 
 (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term Benchmark 
 Loans or RFR Revolving Loans, as applicable, or to convert ABR Loans or RFR Revolving Loans, as 
 applicable, to Term Benchmark Loans shall be suspended, and 
 (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining 
 ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate 
 component of the ABR, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid 
 such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR 
 Rate component of the ABR, 
 in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) above until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the 
 Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. 
 Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to 
 the Administrative Agent), prepay (solely if requirement by a Requirement of Law) or, if applicable, 
 convert all of such Lender s Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Revolving Loans, as applicable, to ABR 
 Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, 
 be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate 
 component of the ABR) either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully 
 continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not 
 lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans. In the event any Lender shall exercise its 
 rights under clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 2.16(b) , all payments and prepayments of principal that 
 would otherwise have been applied to repay the Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Revolving Loans, as 
 applicable, that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Term Benchmark Loans or RFR 
 Revolving Loans, as applicable, of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans (if 
 applicable) made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Term Benchmark 
 Loans or RFR Revolving Loans, as applicable. For purposes of this Section 2.16(b) , a notice to the 
 Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Revolving Loan, as 
 applicable, made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such 
 Term Benchmark Loan in all other cases, such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the 
 Borrower. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, 
 upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may 
 amend this Agreement to replace the applicable Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such 
 amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth 
 (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders 
 and the Borrower, so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of 
 objection to such proposed amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders provided that, 

116 

with respect to any proposed amendment containing any SOFR-Based Rate, the Lenders shall be entitled 
 to object only to the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment contained therein. No replacement of any 
 Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start 
 Date. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent 
 will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, 
 notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments 
 implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any 
 further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. 
 (d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of 
 (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark 
 Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (iv) the 
 commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or 
 election that may be made by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or Lenders pursuant to this Section 
 2.16 , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non- 
 occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, 
 will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and 
 without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this 
 Section 2.16 . 
 (e) Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark 
 Unavailability Period, (i) any Notice of Conversion or Continuation that requests the conversion of any 
 Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing shall be ineffective 
 and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests Term Benchmark Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made 
 as a ABR Borrowing. 
 2.17 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments . 
 (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, from the 
 Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any Commitment Fee and any reduction 
 of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata to the relevant Lenders of any Class according 
 to the respective Term Percentages, Incremental Term Percentages or Revolving Percentages, as the case 
 may be, of the relevant Lenders of such Class. 
 (b) Each payment (including each voluntary or mandatory prepayment) on account 
 of principal of and interest on any Class of the Term Loans shall be made pro rata to the Term Lenders of 
 such Class according to the respective Outstanding Amount of the Term Loans then held by the Term 
 Lenders of such Class. The amount of each optional prepayment of the Term Loans made pursuant to 
 Section 2.10 shall be applied as directed by the Borrower in the notice described in Section 2.10 and, if no 
 direction is given by the Borrower, in the direct order of maturity and to the Term Loans of the Borrower 
 on a pro rata basis. The amount of each mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to 
 Section 2.11 shall be applied as directed by the Borrower in the notice described in Section 2.11 and to 
 the Term Loans of the Borrower on a pro-rata basis (other than in the case of Permitted Credit Agreement 
 Refinancing Debt, the proceeds of which shall be applied to the applicable Class on a pro rata basis) and, 
 if no direction is given by the Borrower, in the direct order of maturity. Each payment (including each 
 prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be 
 made pro rata to the Revolving Lenders according to the respective Outstanding Amount of the Revolving 
 Loans then held by the Revolving Lenders. 

117 

(c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower or the UK 
 Borrower, as applicable, hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be 
 made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 2 00 p.m. (New York City time) on the 
 due date thereof to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 
 10017, for the account of the Lenders, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. Any payments 
 received after such time shall be deemed to be received on the next Business Day at the Administrative 
 Agent s sole discretion. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders 
 promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. 
 (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any 
 Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would 
 constitute its share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent 
 may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the 
 Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower or the UK 
 Borrower, as applicable, a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the 
 Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor (a Funding Default ), such 
 Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate 
 equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in 
 accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender 
 makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the 
 Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph 
 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender s share of such borrowing is not 
 made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after such 
 Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with (without 
 duplication of any such amounts ultimately received from such Lender, and any interest thereon) interest 
 thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the 
 Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from 
 its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the 
 Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, may have against any Lender as a result of any default by 
 such Lender hereunder. 
 (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the 
 Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, prior to the date of any payment due to be made by such 
 Borrower hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the 
 Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative 
 Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders 
 their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the 
 Administrative Agent by the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, within three (3) Business Days 
 after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender 
 to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with 
 interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein shall be 
 deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower or the UK 
 Borrower, as applicable. 
 2.18 Requirements of Law . 
 (a) Subject to clause (c) of this Section 2.18 , if any Change in Law shall (i) subject 
 any Lender to any Tax with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Term 
 Benchmark Loan made by it (except for any Indemnified Taxes or Excluded Taxes), (ii) impose, modify 

118 

or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held 
 by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or 
 any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the 
 determination of any Term Benchmark or (iii) impose on such Lender any other condition, and the result 
 of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender by an amount that such Lender reasonably 
 deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Term Benchmark Loans or 
 issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect 
 thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any 
 additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount 
 receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it 
 shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of 
 which it has become so entitled. 
 (b) Subject to clause Section 2.18 (c) of this Section 2.18 , if any Lender shall have 
 determined that compliance by such Lender (or any corporation controlling such Lender) with any 
 Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return 
 on such Lender s or such corporation s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or 
 in respect of any Loans or Letters of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation 
 could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such 
 corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount reasonably deemed by 
 such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower 
 (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor (setting forth in reasonable detail 
 the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.18(b) ), the 
 Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or 
 such corporation for such reduction. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including 
 clauses (a) and (b) above), reimbursement pursuant to this Section 2.18 for (A) increased costs arising 
 from any market disruption (i) shall be limited to circumstances generally affecting the banking market 
 and (ii) may only be requested by Lenders representing the Majority Facility Lenders with respect to the 
 applicable Facility and (B) increased costs because of any Change in Law resulting from clause (x) or (y) 
 of the proviso to the definition of Change in Law may only be requested by a Lender imposing such 
 increased costs on borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower under syndicated credit facilities 
 comparable to those provided hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to 
 this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be 
 conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the additional amount 
 shown as due on any such certificate promptly after, and in any event within, ten (10) Business Days of, 
 receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be 
 required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months 
 prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender s intention to claim compensation 
 therefor provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such 
 nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of 
 the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of 
 the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 2.19 Taxes . 
 (a) Payments Free of Taxes . All payments by or on account of any obligation of the 
 Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction 

119 

or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law, as determined 
 in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent, requires the deduction or withholding of 
 any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, the applicable withholding agent shall make 
 such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant 
 Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum 
 payable by the Borrower or the UK Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction 
 or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums 
 payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have 
 received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower . Without duplication of any obligation 
 under Section 2.19(a) , the Borrower and the UK Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental 
 Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely 
 reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 (c) Indemnification by the Borrower . Without duplication of any obligation under 
 Section 2.19(a) or (b) , the Borrower and the UK Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) 
 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified 
 Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by 
 such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any 
 reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or 
 not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental 
 Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a 
 Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on 
 behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such written demand shall be made no later 
 than 180 days after the earlier of (1) the date on which the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, 
 as the case may be, received written demand for payment of the applicable Indemnified Taxes from the 
 relevant Governmental Authority or (2) the date on which the Administrative Agent or the applicable 
 Lender, as the case may be, paid the applicable Indemnified Taxes provided that failure or delay on the 
 part of the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, to make such written 
 demand shall not constitute a waiver of the right of the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as 
 the case may be, to demand indemnity and reimbursement for such Indemnified Taxes, except to the 
 extent that such failure or delay results in prejudice to the Borrower. 
 (d) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the 
 Borrower or the UK Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrower or the 
 UK Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued 
 by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment 
 or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (e) Status of Lenders . 
 (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of 
 withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower 
 and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the 
 Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at 
 a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably 

120 

requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative 
 Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting 
 requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, 
 execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.19 
 in clauses (e)(ii)(1) , (e)(ii)(2) , and (e)(ii)(4) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable 
 judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material 
 unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such 
 Lender. 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing 
 (1) any Lender that is a United States person as defined in 
 Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative 
 Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this 
 Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower 
 or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such 
 Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax 
 (2) any Lender that is not a United States person as defined in 
 Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally 
 entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number 
 of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such 
 Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time 
 thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), 
 whichever of the following is applicable 
 (A) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of 
 an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party

 the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with 
 respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan 
 Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN- 
 E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. 
 federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business 
 profits or other income article of such tax treaty 
 (B) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI 
 (C) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of 
 the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) 
 of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of 
 Exhibit M-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is 
 not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A)

 within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, 
 or a controlled foreign corporation related to the 

121

 and indirect partner

 do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as 
 shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S.

 any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a 
 reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such

 were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including 
 those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient 
 shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed

 Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as 
 prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation

 for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under 
 FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has complied with such Recipient s 
 obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold 
 from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (4) , FATCA shall include any 
 amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

 Agreement (including by the Borrower and the UK Borrower, as applicable, and the Guarantors) as if it is 
 not a UK Qualifying Lender, until such time as it notifies the Administrative Agent which category 
 applies (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Borrower and 
 the UK Borrower thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, any documentation which a Lender executes on 
 becoming a party to this Agreement shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with 
 this Section 2.19(e)(iii) . 
 (f) Additional United Kingdom Withholding Tax Matters. 
 (i) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.19 and subject to paragraph (f)(ii)

 under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme and (y) wishes such scheme to apply to this 
 Agreement, shall provide its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to the

 Amendment Effective Date that (x) holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport

 reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to the UK Borrower and the Administrative 
 Agent and, having done so, such Lender shall have satisfied its obligation under paragraph (f)(i) 
 above. 
 (iii) If a Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax 
 residence in accordance with paragraph (f)(ii) above, the UK Borrower shall make a Borrower 
 DTTP Filing with respect to such Lender, and shall promptly provide such Lender with a copy of 
 such filing provided that if (A) either of the following has occurred 
 (1) the UK Borrower making a payment to such Lender has not made a 
 Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of such Lender or 
 (2) the UK Borrower making a payment to such Lender has made a 
 Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of such Lender but either (A) such Borrower DTTP 
 Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue & Customs or (B) HM Revenue & Customs 
 has not given the UK Borrower authority to make payments to such Lender without a 
 deduction for tax within sixty (60) days of the date of such Borrower DTTP Filing 
 and (B) in each case, the UK Borrower has notified that Lender in writing of the occurrence of either (1) 
 or (2) in clause (iii)(A) hereof, then such Lender and the UK Borrower shall co-operate in completing any 
 additional procedural formalities necessary for the UK Borrower to obtain authorization to make that 
 payment without a Tax Deduction. 
 (iv) If a Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax 
 residence in accordance with paragraph (f)(ii) above, the UK Borrower shall not make a Borrower

123 

of that Lender s Commitment(s) or its participation in any Loan unless the Lender otherwise 
 agrees. 
 (v) The UK Borrower shall, promptly after making a Borrower DTTP Filing, deliver 
 a copy of such Borrower DTTP Filing to the Administrative Agent for delivery to the relevant 
 Lender. 
 (vi) Each Lender shall notify the Borrower, the UK Borrower and Administrative 
 Agent if it determines (acting reasonably and in good faith) that has ceased to be entitled to claim 
 the benefits of a UK Treaty with respect to payments made by the UK Borrower hereunder. 
 (vii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered 
 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification 
 or promptly notify the Borrower, the UK Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its 
 legal inability to do so. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19 , a Lender shall 
 not be required to deliver any documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 (viii) Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan 
 Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender 
 to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.19 . 
 (g) Status of Administrative Agent . Prior to the date it becomes the Administrative 
 Agent under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower a duly completed 
 IRS Form W-9 (or, in the case of a successor Administrative Agent that is not organized in the United 
 States, a duly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (with respect to any payments to be received on its own 
 behalf) and IRS Form W-8IMY (for all other payments)) with the effect that the Borrower may make 
 payments to the Administrative Agent, to the extent such payments are received by the Administrative 
 Agent as an intermediary, without deduction or withholding of any Taxes imposed by the United States 
 (without regard to the beneficial owners of such payment). 
 (h) Refunds . If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole 
 discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund (whether in the form of cash or as a credit 
 against, or as a reduction of, a tax liability) of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Loan 
 Parties or with respect to which the Loan Parties have paid additional amounts pursuant to this 
 Section 2.19 , it shall pay over such refund to the relevant Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity 
 payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Parties under this Section 2.19 with respect to 
 the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or 
 such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority 
 with respect to such refund) provided that the relevant Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative 
 Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Loan Parties plus any penalties, 
 interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or 
 such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such 
 Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.19(h) , in no event 
 will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Loan Parties pursuant 
 to this Section 2.19(h) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a 
 less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and 
 giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification 
 payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 2.19(h) shall 
 not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or 

124 

any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other 
 Person. 
 (i) VAT . (i) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Loan Document by any party 
 to any Recipient which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT 
 purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and 
 accordingly, subject to paragraph (ii) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by 
 any Recipient to any party under a Loan Document and such Recipient is required to account to the 
 relevant Governmental Authority for the VAT, that party must pay to such Recipient (in addition to 
 and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the 
 amount of the VAT (and such Recipient must promptly provide a valid VAT invoice to that party). 
 (ii) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Recipient 
 (the Supplier to any other Recipient (the VAT Recipient under a Loan Document, and any party 
 other than the VAT Recipient (the Relevant Party is required by the terms of any Loan Document to 
 pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to 
 reimburse or indemnify the VAT Recipient in respect of that consideration) 
 (A) where the Supplier is the person required to account to the 
 relevant Governmental Authority for the VAT, the Relevant Party must also pay to the 
 Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the 
 amount of the VAT. The VAT Recipient must (where this paragraph (A) applies) 
 promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the VAT 
 Recipient receives from the relevant Governmental Authority which the VAT Recipient 
 reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply and 
 (B) where the VAT Recipient is the person required to account to the 
 relevant Governmental Authority for the VAT, the Relevant Party must promptly, 
 following demand from the VAT Recipient, pay to the VAT Recipient an amount equal 
 to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the VAT Recipient 
 reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant 
 Governmental Authority in respect of that VAT. 
 (ii) Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify a 
 Recipient for any cost or expense, that party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) 
 such Recipient for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as 
 represents VAT, save to the extent that such Recipient determines (acting reasonably and in good 
 faith) that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant 
 Governmental Authority. 
 (iii) Any reference in this Section 2.19(i) to any party shall, at any time when 
 such party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and 
 unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at 
 such time (the term representative member to have the same meaning as in the VATA) or to 
 any substantially similar concept under any equivalent legislation in any other jurisdiction, as 
 appropriate. 
 (iv) In relation to any supply made by a Recipient to any party under a Loan 
 Document, if reasonably requested by such Recipient, that party must promptly provide such 

125 

Recipient with details of that party's party s VAT registration and such other information as is 
 reasonably requested in connection with such Recipient 's Recipient s VAT reporting 
 requirements in relation to such supply. 
 (j) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement 
 and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 (k) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 2.19 , the term Lender 
 shall include any Issuing Lender. 
 2.20 Reserved . 
 2.21 Indemnity . The Borrower agree to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender 
 harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a direct consequence of 
 (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Term 
 Benchmark Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the 
 provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion 
 from Term Benchmark Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the 
 provisions of this Agreement, (c) the conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan prior to the last day of the 
 Interest Period thereof or (d) the making of a prepayment of Term Benchmark Loans on a day that is not 
 the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification shall not exceed an amount 
 equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid 
 or converted, or not so borrowed, reduced, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such 
 prepayment or of such failure to borrow, reduce, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period 
 (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, reduce, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have 
 commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest or other return for 
 such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over 
 (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such 
 Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in 
 the secured overnight financing market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 
 submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This 
 covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other 
 amounts payable hereunder. 
 2.22 Change of Lending Office . 
 (a) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the 
 operation of Sections 2.18 or 2.19 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use 
 reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending 
 office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event 
 provided that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such 
 Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage provided , further , 
 that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of 
 any Lender pursuant to Sections 2.18 or 2.19 . 
 (b) Subject to clause (a) above, and without prejudice to the rights and obligations 
 (but subject to the terms and requirements) in Section 2.19 , the Borrower agrees that each Lender may, at 
 its option, make any Loan available to the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, by causing any 
 foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan, and that any exercise of such 

126 

option shall not affect or postpone any of the obligations of such Borrower or the rights of any Lender 
 pursuant to this Agreement. 
 2.23 Replacement of Lenders . The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender (or 
 prepay the Loans of such Lender on a non-pro rata basis) (a) where a Loan Party is obligated to pay 
 additional amounts or indemnity payments under Section 2.19 , (b) that requests reimbursement for 
 amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 or Section 2.18 , (c) that becomes a Defaulting Lender or 
 otherwise defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder or (d) that has not consented to a proposed 
 change, waiver, discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by 
 Section 11.1 that requires the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders under a particular Facility or each 
 Lender affected thereby and which has been approved by the Required Lenders or a majority (by 
 aggregate principal amount) of such affected Lenders as provided in Section 11.1 , in each case, with a 
 Lender or an Eligible Assignee provided that (i) such replacement or repayment does not conflict with 
 any Requirement of Law, (ii) the replacement financial institution or other Eligible Assignee shall 
 purchase (or the Borrower shall prepay) all Loans and other amounts (or, in the case of clause (d) as it 
 relates to provisions affecting a particular Facility, Loans or other amounts owing under such Facility) 
 owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement or repayment, (iii) the Borrower 
 shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.21 if any Term Benchmark Loan owing to such 
 replaced Lender shall be purchased or prepaid other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating 
 thereto, (iv) if applicable, the replacement financial institution or other Eligible Assignee, if not already a 
 Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (v) if applicable, the replaced 
 Lender shall be deemed to have made such replacement in accordance with the provisions of 
 Section 11.6 , (vi) until such time as such replacement or repayment shall be consummated, the Borrower 
 shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Sections 2.16 , 2.18 , 2.19(a) or 2.19(c) , as the 
 case may be, and (vii) any such replacement or repayment shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any 
 rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced or 
 repaid Lender. Upon any such assignment, such replaced or repaid Lender shall no longer constitute a 
 Lender for purposes hereof (or, in the case of clause (d) as it relates to provisions affecting a particular 
 Facility, a Lender under such Facility) provided that any rights of such replaced or repaid Lender to 
 indemnification hereunder shall survive as to such replaced or repaid Lender. Each Lender, the 
 Administrative Agent and the Borrower agree that in connection with the replacement or repayment of a 
 Lender and upon payment to such replaced or repaid Lender of all amounts required to be paid under this 
 Section 2.23 , the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be authorized, without the need for 
 additional consent from such replaced Lender, to execute an Assignment and Assumption on behalf of 
 such replaced Lender, and any such Assignment and Assumption so executed by the Administrative 
 Agent or the Borrower and, to the extent required under Section 11.6 , the Borrower and each Issuing 
 Lender, shall be effective for purposes of this Section 2.23 and Section 11.6 . Notwithstanding anything to 
 the contrary in this Section 2.23 , in the event that a Lender which holds Loans or Commitments under 
 more than one Facility does not agree to a proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or 
 waiver which requires the consent of all Lenders under a particular Facility, the Borrower shall be 
 permitted to replace or repay the non-consenting Lender with respect to the affected Facility and may, but 
 shall not be required to, replace or repay such Lender with respect to any unaffected Facilities. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing and solely in connection with the Fifth Amendment, (A) the 
 Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall not be required to execute and deliver to the Administrative 
 Agent a duly completed Assignment and Assumption and or such other documentation with respect to a 
 Fifth Amendment Non-Consenting Lender to the Fifth Amendment (a Fifth Amendment Non- 
 Consenting Lender and (B) with respect to each consenting Lender, as determined by the Borrower and 
 the Administrative Agent (such Lender or Lenders, collectively the Fifth Amendment Reduced Lenders 
 and, together with, the Fifth Amendment Non-Consenting Lenders, the Fifth Amendment Replaced 

127 

Lenders with respect to all or a portion of such Fifth Amendment Reduced Lender s outstanding Initial 
 Term Loans, as determined by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (such Initial Term Loans, the 
 Fifth Amendment Reduced Term Loans and, together with all of the Fifth Amendment Non-Consenting 
 Lender s Initial Term Loans, collectively, the Fifth Amendment Replaced Term Loans ), the assignment 
 of any Fifth Amendment Replaced Lender s Fifth Amendment Replaced Term Loans pursuant to this 
 Section 2.23 and Section 11.16 shall become effective immediately upon receipt by (i) such Fifth 
 Amendment Replaced Lender of a notice that all such Fifth Amendment Replaced Lender s Fifth 
 Amendment Replaced Term Loans are being required to be assigned to such assignee, which notice shall 
 be signed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the applicable assignee and (ii) the 
 Administrative Agent (for the account of such Fifth Amendment Replaced Lender) of immediately 
 available funds (x) from such assignee in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Fifth 
 Amendment Replaced Lender s Fifth Amendment Replaced Term Loans and (y) from the Borrower in an 
 amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on such Fifth Amendment Replaced Lender s 
 Fifth Amendment Replaced Lenders Term Loans to, but excluding, the date of such payment and all other 
 amounts required by this Section 2.23 .

 the Administrative Agent), the Borrower (or, where applicable and requested, the UK Borrower) shall 
 execute and deliver to such Lender (and or, if applicable and if so specified in such notice, to any Person 
 who is an assignee of such Lender pursuant to Section 11.6 (promptly after the Borrower s receipt of 
 such notice) a Note or Notes to evidence such Lender s Loans.

 Subject to the terms of this Section 2.25 
 (a) The Borrower may (including, on behalf of the UK Borrower in connection with 
 an Additional Revolving Commitment and or Revolving Commitment Increase), at any time or from time 
 to time after the Closing Date, by notice from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (whereupon the 
 Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) and the Person appointed by 
 the Borrower to arrange an Incremental Facility (such Person (who (i) may be the Administrative Agent, 
 if it so agrees, or (ii) any other Person appointed by the Borrower after consultation with the 
 Administrative Agent, the Incremental Arranger )), request one or more additional tranches of term 
 loans and or one or more increases to the amount of any Class of Term Loans then outstanding (the

 Commitments, any such Revolving Commitment Increase and any such Incremental Term Loans, the 
 aggregate amount of such Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments, Revolving Commitment 
 Increases and Incremental Term Loans shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Ratio- 
 Based Incremental Amount (any Incurrence under this clause (x) , a Ratio-Based Incremental Facility ), 
 plus (y) the Prepayment-Based Incremental Amount (any Incurrence under this clause (y) , a 
 Prepayment-Based Incremental Facility ), plus (z) the Cash-Capped Incremental Amount (any 

128 

Incurrence under this clause (z) , a Cash-Capped Incremental Facility provided that, for the avoidance 
 of doubt, the amount available to the Borrower pursuant to the Prepayment-Based Incremental Facility 
 and the Cash-Capped Incremental Facility shall be available at all times and shall not be subject to the 
 ratio test in the Ratio-Based Incremental Facility. Unless the Borrower elects otherwise, any Incremental 
 Term Loans, Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments or Revolving Commitment Increase shall 
 be deemed Incurred first under the Ratio-Based Incremental Facility, with the balance Incurred next under 
 the Prepayment-Based Incremental Facility and then under the Cash-Capped Incremental Facility. The 
 Borrower may designate any Incremental Arranger of any Incremental Facility with such titles under the 
 Incremental Facility as Borrower may deem appropriate 
 (ii) as determined by the Borrower, (A) the Incremental Revolving Loans 
 shall rank pari passu in right of payment and of security and (B) the Incremental Term Loans shall rank 
 pari passu in right of payment (or be subordinated if agreed by the Lenders providing such Incremental 
 Term Loans) and of security (or on a junior lien or unsecured basis, to the extent agreed by the Lenders 
 providing such Incremental Term Loans), and shall, if not pari passu in right of payment or security, be 
 provided as a separate facility and, if secured, be subject to an Intercreditor Agreement

 a customary bridge facility) shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity no shorter than the Weighted 
 Average Life to Maturity of the Term Loans (without giving effect to any prepayments that would 
 otherwise modify the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term Loans) 
 (v) (x) the All-In Yield (and, in the case of any Incremental Term Loan, 
 subject to clauses (iii) and (iv) above, the amortization schedule) applicable to any such Incremental Term 
 Loans or Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments shall be determined by the Borrower and the 
 applicable Incremental Term Lenders or Incremental Revolving Lenders, as the case may be, and (y) any 
 such Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments or Revolving Commitment Increase shall not 
 have amortization or scheduled mandatory commitment reductions prior to the Revolving Termination 
 Date 
 (vi) (A) the representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all 
 material respects as of the applicable Incremental Facility Closing Date (or, in connection with a Limited 
 Condition Transaction, the Specified Representations shall be true and correct in all material respects) 
 and (B) no Default or Event of Default (or, in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, no 
 Default or Specified Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) or 9.1(g) shall exist on the Incremental

 (and after giving effect to any Incremental Term Loans and or Incremental Revolving Loans made 
 thereunder) 
 (vii) with respect to any Incremental Term Loans that are denominated in 
 Dollars that are secured on a pari passu basis with the Obligations and are made if on or prior to the date 
 that is twelve six months after the Closing Seventh Amendment Effective Date, if the All-In Yield with 
 respect to the any Incremental Term Loans made thereunder paid by the Borrower (as determined by the 
 Borrower and the applicable Incremental Term Lenders) with respect to the Incremental Term Loans 
 made thereunder borrowed hereunder exceeds the then applicable All-In Yield paid by the Borrower with 

129 

respect to the Initial Term Loans that are denominated in the same currency as such Incremental Term 
 Loans , as the case may be, after giving effect to any increase or repricing thereof that has theretofore 
 become effective (it being understood that (i) if any such repricing was effected as a refinancing tranche, 
 the OID applicable to the refinancing loans shall be taken into account in lieu of the OID applicable to the 
 Refinanced loans and (ii) such All-In Yield calculated immediate prior to the time of the addition of such 
 Incremental Term Loans), on the Term Loans outstanding on the Seventh Amendment Effective Date (the 
 Existing Term Loans at such time by more than 50 basis points (the amount of such excess above 
 50 basis points being referred to herein as the Incremental Yield Differential , then, upon the 
 effectiveness of and such Incremental Amendment Term Loans meet the following conditions (a) are

 denominated in Dollars, (d) provide for the payment of interest at a floating rate, (e) are broadly

 time (provided that any Existing Term Loans held by any Defaulting Lender shall be excluded for 
 purposes of making such determination) have not waived the provisions of this clause (f) (such 
 provisions, the MFN Protection and (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Term Loans 
 that would be subject to the adjustment provided for in this sentence (after giving effect to all other carve- 
 outs thereto) but for this clause (2) exceeds the greater of 574,050,000 and 75.0 of TTM Consolidated 
 EBITDA , the Applicable Margin Rate then in effect for such Initial the Existing Term Loans denominated 
 in the same currency shall automatically be increased by the Incremental Yield Differential provided that 
 (1) if the (it being agreed that any increase in the Effective Yield of such Existing Term Loans required 
 solely due to the application of a Term SOFR floor or an ABR floor on any Incremental Term Loans 
 include an interest-rate floor greater than the interest rate shall be effected solely through an increase in (or 
 implementation of, as applicable) any Term SOFR floor or ABR floor applicable to such Initial Term 
 Loans, the differential between such interest rate floors shall be equated to the interest rate margins for 
 purposes of determining whether an increase to the Applicable Margin shall be required, but only to the 
 extent an increase in the interest rate floor applicable to such Initial Term Loans would cause an increase 
 in the Applicable Margin, and in such case the interest rate floor (but not the Applicable Margin) 
 applicable to such Initial Term Loans shall be increased to the extent of such differential between interest 
 rate floors and (2) any Incremental Term Loans that constitute fixed-rate Indebtedness shall be swapped 
 to a floating rate on a customary matched-maturity basis Existing Term Loans). 
 (viii) the Incremental Term Loans, Additional Replacement Revolving 
 Commitments and Revolving Commitment Increases may be denominated in Dollars or any other 
 Alternative Currency and

 Collateral and no Incremental Term Loans and Revolving Commitment Increases shall be guaranteed by 
 any person other than the Loan Parties. 
 All or any portion of Indebtedness originally designated as Incurred under the Cash- 
 Capped Incremental Facility or the Prepayment-Based Incremental Facility will automatically be 
 reclassified as having been Incurred under the Ratio-Based Incremental Facility so long as, at the time of 
 such reclassification (without giving effect to any amounts previously Incurred under the Cash-Capped 
 Incremental Facility or the Prepayment-Based Incremental Facility that are not being reclassified), the 

130 

Borrower would be permitted to Incur the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness being so 
 reclassified under the Ratio-Based Incremental Facility (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall have the 
 effect of increasing availability under the Cash-Capped Incremental Facility or Prepayment-Based 
 Incremental Facility, as applicable, by the amount of such reclassified Indebtedness). 
 (b) Incremental Term Loans may provide for the ability to participate on a pro rata , 
 greater than pro rata or less than pro rata basis in any voluntary prepayments of Term Loans or any 
 mandatory prepayments of Term Loans with the proceeds of Other Term Loans and on a pro rata or less 
 than pro rata basis with any other prepayment of Term Loans (except for any permitted amortization 
 schedule and any earlier maturing debt, which in any event shall be permitted). Additional Replacement 
 Revolving Commitments may participate in the payment, borrowing, participation and commitment 
 reduction provisions herein on a pro rata basis with any then outstanding Revolving Loans and Revolving 
 Commitments, except that the Borrower shall be permitted to permanently repay and terminate 
 commitments of any such Class on a better than a pro rata basis as compared to any other Class with a 
 later maturity date than such Class. Incremental Revolving Lenders may agree to a less than pro rata 
 share of any prepayment Incremental Term Loans, Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments and 
 Revolving Commitment Increases may benefit from the same Guarantees applicable to then outstanding 
 Term Loans and Revolving Commitments. The Revolving Commitment Increases shall be on the exact 
 same terms and pursuant to the exact same documentation, be treated substantially the same as the 
 Revolving Commitments being increased, and shall be considered to be part of the Class of Revolving 
 Facility being increased (it being understood that, if required to consummate the provision of Revolving 
 Commitment Increases, the pricing, interest rate margins, rate floors and commitment fees on the Class of 
 Revolving Commitments being increased may be increased and additional upfront or similar fees may be 
 payable to the lenders providing the Revolving Commitment Increase (without any requirement to pay 
 such fees to any existing Revolving Lenders)). Each notice from the Borrower to the Administrative 
 Agent and the Incremental Arranger pursuant to Section 2.25(a) shall set forth the requested amount and 
 proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Term Loans, Additional Replacement Revolving 
 Commitments or Revolving Commitment Increase. 
 (c) Incremental Term Loans may be made, and Additional Replacement Revolving 
 Commitments and Revolving Commitment Increases may be provided by any existing Lender or any 
 Additional Lender provided that no existing Lender shall be obligated to provide any portion of any 
 Incremental Facility), in each case on terms permitted in this Section 2.25 , and, to the extent not permitted 
 in this Section 2.25 , all terms and documentation with respect to any Incremental Term Loan, Additional 
 Replacement Revolving Commitments or Revolving Commitment Increase shall be reasonably 
 satisfactory to the Administrative Agent provided that terms that (i) are more restrictive on the Group 
 Members, taken as a whole, than those with respect to the Term Loans and Revolving Commitments 
 made on the Closing Date (but excluding (1) any terms applicable after the Latest Maturity Date and (2) 
 are more favorable to the existing Lenders than the comparable terms in the existing Loan Documents, in 
 which case such terms may be incorporated into this Agreement (or any other applicable Loan Document) 
 pursuant to an amendment executed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower for the benefit of all 
 existing Lenders (to the extent applicable to such Lender) without further amendment or consent 
 requirements) or (ii) relate to provisions of a mechanical (including with respect to the Collateral and 
 currency mechanics) or administrative nature, shall in each case be reasonably satisfactory to the 
 Administrative Agent provided that if a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower shall have 
 been delivered to the Administrative Agent for posting to the Lenders at least five (5) Business Days prior 
 to the incurrence of such Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments, Revolving Commitment 
 Increases and or Incremental Term Loans, together with a reasonably detailed description of the material 
 covenants and events of default of such Indebtedness or drafts of the documentation relating thereto, 

131 

stating that the Borrower has determined in good faith that such terms and conditions satisfy the 
 requirement of this clause (i) or (ii) and the Required Lenders shall not have notified the Borrower and the 
 Administrative Agent that they disagree with such determination (including a statement of the basis upon 
 which each such Lender disagrees) within such five (5) Business Day period, then such certificate shall be 
 conclusive evidence that such material covenants and events of default satisfy such requirement 
 provided , further , that (A) (x) the Administrative Agent shall have consented (such consent not to be 
 unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such Lender s making such Additional Replacement 
 Revolving Commitments or Revolving Commitment Increases if such consent would be required under 
 Section 11.6(b) for an assignment of Loans or Revolving Commitments, as applicable, to such Lender or 
 Additional Lender and each Issuing Lender shall have consented (such consent not to be unreasonably 
 withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such Lender s making such Additional Replacement Revolving 
 Commitments or Revolving Commitment Increases and (B) the Administrative Agent shall not be 
 required to execute, accept or acknowledge any Incremental Amendment (as defined below) or related 
 documentation which contains (by express language or omission) any material deviation from the terms 
 of this Section 2.25 (as determined in the Administrative Agent s reasonable discretion). Commitments 
 in respect of Incremental Term Loans, Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments and Revolving 
 Commitment Increases shall become Commitments (or in the case of a Revolving Commitment Increase 
 to be provided by an existing Revolving Lender, an increase in such Lender s applicable Revolving 
 Commitment) under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an Incremental Amendment to this 
 Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative 
 Agent and each Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, and each Additional Lender, if any. 
 The Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to 
 this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable 
 opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Incremental Arranger and the Borrower, to effect the provisions 
 of this Section 2.25 (including any amendments that are not adverse to the interests of any Lender that are 
 made to effectuate changes necessary to enable any Incremental Term Loans that are intended to be 
 fungible with an existing Class of Term Loans to be fungible with such Term Loans, which shall include 
 any amendments to Section 2.3 that do not reduce the ratable amortization received by each Lender 
 thereunder). The effectiveness of any Incremental Amendment and the occurrence of any credit event 
 (including the making (but not the conversion or continuation) of a Loan and the issuance, increase in the 
 amount, or extension of a Letter of Credit thereunder) pursuant to such Incremental Amendment shall be 
 subject to the satisfaction of such conditions as the parties thereto shall agree (the effective date of any 
 such Incremental Amendment, an Incremental Facility Closing Date ). The Borrower will use the 
 proceeds of the Incremental Term Loans, Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments and 
 Revolving Commitment Increases for any purpose not prohibited by this Agreement. No Lender shall be 
 obligated to provide any Incremental Term Loans, Additional Replacement Revolving Commitments or 
 Revolving Commitment Increases, unless it so agrees. 
 (d) Upon each Revolving Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section 2.25 , each 
 Revolving Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be 
 deemed to have assigned to each Lender providing a portion of the Revolving Commitment Increase 
 (each a Revolving Commitment Increase Lender in respect of such increase, and each such Revolving 
 Commitment Increase Lender will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed, a 
 portion of such Revolving Lender s participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit such that, 
 after giving effect to each such deemed assignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of 
 the aggregate outstanding participations hereunder in Letters of Credit will equal the percentage of the 
 aggregate Revolving Commitments of all Revolving Lenders represented by such Revolving Lender s 
 Revolving Commitment and if, on the date of such increase, there are any Revolving Loans outstanding, 
 such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Revolving Commitment Increase 

132 

either be prepaid from the proceeds of additional Revolving Loans made hereunder or assigned to a 
 Revolving Commitment Increase Lender (in each case, reflecting such increase in Revolving 
 Commitments, such that Revolving Loans are held ratably in accordance with each Revolving Lender s 
 Pro Rata Share, after giving effect to such increase), which prepayment or assignment shall be 
 accompanied by accrued interest on the Revolving Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any 
 Lender in accordance with Section 2.21 (it being understood that the foregoing provisions shall apply 
 only to an increase in the amount of the Revolving Commitments of any Class and not to any additional 
 tranches of Revolving Loans). The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum 
 borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement 
 shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. For the 
 avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.25(d) shall apply only to such Class of Revolving Commitments that 
 are the same Class as the Incremental Revolving Loans and shall not apply to any other Class of 
 Revolving Loans. 
 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 2.25 shall 
 supersede any provisions in Sections 2.17 or 11.1 to the contrary and Section 2.17 shall be deemed to be 
 amended to implement any Incremental Amendment. 
 (f) If the Incremental Arranger is not the Administrative Agent, the actions 
 authorized to be taken by the Incremental Arranger herein shall be done in consultation with the 
 Administrative Agent and, with respect to the preparation of any documentation necessary or appropriate 
 to carry out the provisions of this Section 2.25 (including amendments to this Agreement and the other 
 Loan Documents), any comments to such documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative 
 Agent shall be reflected therein. 
 2.26 Refinancing Amendments . 
 (a) At any time after the Closing Date, the Borrower may obtain, from any Lender or 
 any Additional Lender, Permitted Credit Agreement Refinancing Debt in respect of (1) all or any portion 
 of the Term Loans then outstanding under this Agreement (which for purposes of this clause (1) will be 
 deemed to include any then outstanding Other Term Loans) or (2) all or any portion of the Revolving 
 Loans (or unused Revolving Commitments) under this Agreement (which for purposes of this clause (2) 
 will be deemed to include any then outstanding Other Revolving Loans and Other Revolving 
 Commitments), in the form of (x) Other Term Loans or Other Term Commitments or (y) Other Revolving 
 Loans or Other Revolving Commitments, as the case may be, in each case pursuant to a Refinancing 
 Amendment provided that such Permitted Credit Agreement Refinancing Debt 
 (i) shall not be permitted to rank senior in right of payment or security to the 
 Loans and Commitments hereunder 
 (ii) will have such pricing, fees and amortization (subject to clause (iii) 
 below), call protection and prepayment premiums as may be agreed by the Borrower and the Lenders 
 thereof 
 (iii) (x) with respect to any Other Revolving Loans or Other Revolving 
 Commitments, will have a maturity date that is not prior to the maturity date of Revolving Loans (or 
 unused Revolving Commitments) being Refinanced and (y) with respect to any Other Term Loans or 
 Other Term Commitments, will have a maturity date that is not prior to the maturity date of, and will have 
 a Weighted Average Life to Maturity that is not shorter than, the Term Loans being Refinanced 

133 

(iv) Other than with respect to (A) clause (ii) above, (B) covenants and other 
 provisions applicable only to periods after the Latest Maturity Date that is in effect and (C) optional 
 prepayment and redemption terms and, in each case, subject to the proviso below, will have terms and 
 conditions that are either (x) consistent with, or, taken as a whole, less favorable to the Lenders or 
 Additional Lenders providing such Permitted Credit Agreement Refinancing Debt than the Refinanced 
 Debt or (y) or approved by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion 
 (v) the proceeds of such Permitted Credit Agreement Refinancing Debt shall 
 be applied, substantially concurrently with the Incurrence thereof, to the prepayment of outstanding Term 
 Loans or reduction of Revolving Commitments being so Refinanced (and repayment of Revolving Loans 
 outstanding thereunder) and 
 (vi) shall not be secured by any assets other than the Collateral, shall not be 
 guaranteed by any person other than the Guarantors 
 provided , further , that the terms and conditions applicable to such Permitted Credit Agreement 
 Refinancing Debt may provide for any additional or different financial or other covenants or other 
 provisions that are agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders thereof and applicable only during 
 periods after the Latest Maturity Date that is in effect on the date such Permitted Credit Agreement 
 Refinancing Debt is issued, Incurred or obtained or added to the Loan Documents for the benefit of the 
 applicable Lenders pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment provided , further that if a certificate of a 
 Responsible Officer of the Borrower shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent for posting to 
 the Lenders at least five (5) Business Days prior to the incurrence of such Permitted Credit Agreement 
 Refinancing Debt, together with a reasonably detailed description of the material terms and conditions of 
 such Permitted Credit Agreement Refinancing Debt or drafts of the documentation relating thereto, 
 stating that the Borrower has determined in good faith that such terms and conditions satisfy the 
 requirements of this Section 2.26(a) , and the Required Lenders shall not have notified the Borrower and 
 the Administrative Agent that they disagree with such determination (including a statement of the basis 
 upon which each such Lender disagrees) within such five (5) Business Day period, then such certificate 
 shall be conclusive evidence that such terms and conditions satisfy the requirements of this Section 
 2.26(a) . The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date 
 thereof of (i) to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the 
 Administrative Agent of board resolutions, officers certificates and or reaffirmation agreements 
 consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date and (ii) such conditions as the Borrower and 
 providers of said Permitted Credit Agreement Refinancing Debt shall agree. Any Refinancing 
 Amendment may provide for the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower or any 
 Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to any Other Revolving Commitments established thereby, in each case 
 on terms substantially equivalent to the terms applicable to Letters of Credit under the Revolving 
 Commitments subject to the approval of the Issuing Lenders. 
 (b) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the 
 effectiveness of each Refinancing Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the 
 effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent 
 (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Permitted Credit Agreement 
 Refinancing Debt Incurred pursuant thereto (including any amendments necessary to treat the Loans and 
 Commitments subject thereto as Other Term Loans, Other Revolving Loans, Other Revolving 
 Commitments and or Other Term Commitments). 

134 

(c) Any Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, 
 effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or 
 appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Refinancing Arranger and the 
 Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.26 . In addition, if so provided in the relevant 
 Refinancing Amendment and with the consent of each Issuing Lender, participations in Letters of Credit 
 expiring on or after the Revolving Termination Date shall be reallocated from Lenders holding Revolving 
 Commitments to Lenders holding Extended Revolving Commitments in accordance with the terms of 
 such Refinancing Amendment provided , however , that such participation interests shall, upon receipt 
 thereof by the relevant Lenders holding revolving commitments, be deemed to be participation interests in 
 respect of such revolving commitments and the terms of such participation interests (including the 
 commission applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly. 
 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section 2.26 
 shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.17 or 11.1 to the contrary and the Borrower and the 
 Administrative Agent may amend Section 2.17 to implement any Refinancing Amendment. 
 (e) If the Refinancing Arranger is not the Administrative Agent, the actions 
 authorized to be taken by the Incremental Arranger herein shall be done in consultation with the 
 Refinancing Arranger and, with respect to the preparation of any documentation necessary or appropriate 
 to carry out the provisions of this Section 2.26 (including amendments to this Agreement and the other 
 Loan Documents), any comments to such documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative 
 Agent shall be reflected therein. 
 2.27 Defaulting Lenders . 
 (a) Adjustments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
 Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer 
 a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law 
 (i) Waivers and Amendments . Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or 
 disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as 
 provided for in the definitions of Required Lenders , Majority Revolving Lenders and Majority Term 
 Lenders and otherwise as set forth in Section 11.1 . 
 (ii) Reallocation of Payments . Any payment of principal, interest, fees or 
 other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether 
 voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 9 or otherwise, and including any amounts made 
 available to the Administrative Agent by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.8 ), shall be 
 applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows first , to the 
 payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder 
 second , in the case of a Revolving Lender, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by 
 such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lenders hereunder third , as the Borrower may request (so long as 
 no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting 
 Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the 
 Administrative Agent fourth , in the case of a Revolving Lender, if so determined by the Administrative 
 Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to 
 satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement fifth , to the payment 
 of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of 
 competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, such Issuing Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a 

135 

result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement sixth , so long as no 
 Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of 
 any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting 
 Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement and 
 seventh , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction provided 
 that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L C Advances and such Lender 
 is a Defaulting Lender under clause (a) of the definition thereof, such payment shall be applied solely to 
 pay the relevant Loans of, and L C Advances owed to, the relevant non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata 
 basis prior to being applied pursuant to Section 3.2(b) . Any payments, prepayments or other amounts 
 paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting 
 Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 3.2(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by 
 such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
 (iii) Certain Fees . Such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive or 
 accrue Letter of Credit fees or any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.8(a) for any period during which 
 that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that 
 otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender). 
 (iv) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure . 
 During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the 
 obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, Refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit 
 pursuant to Section 3.4 , the Pro Rata Share of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without 
 giving effect to the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender provided that the aggregate 
 obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, Refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit 
 shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Revolving Commitment of such non-Defaulting 
 Lender minus (2) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans of such Lender. In the event 
 non-Defaulting Lenders obligations to acquire, Refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit are 
 increased as a result of a Defaulting Lender, then all Letter of Credit fees that would have been paid to 
 such Defaulting Lender shall be paid to such non-Defaulting Lenders ratably in accordance with such 
 increase of such non-Defaulting Lender s obligations to acquire, Refinance or fund participations in 
 Letters of Credit. Subject to Section 11.16 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release 
 of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become 
 a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting 
 Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 (b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each 
 Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting 
 Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date 
 specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements 
 with respect to any cash collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of 
 outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may 
 determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit 
 to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share (without giving 
 effect to Section 2.27(a)(iv) ), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender provided that 
 no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf 
 of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender provided , further , that except to the extent 
 otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties and subject to Section 11.16 , no change hereunder from 
 Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder 
 arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 

136 

(c) No Release . Subject to Section 11.16 , the provisions hereof attributable to 
 Defaulting Lenders shall not release or excuse any Defaulting Lender from failure to perform its 
 obligations hereunder. 
 2.28 Loan Modification Offers .

 Agreement (a Loan Modification Agreement executed and delivered by the Borrower, the 
 Administrative Agent, each applicable Accepting Lender and the Loan Modification Agent. The Loan 
 Modification Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Loan Modification 
 Agreement. Each Loan Modification Agreement may, without the consent of any Lender other than the 
 applicable Accepting Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
 as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Loan Modification Agent and the Borrower, to 
 give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.28 , including any amendments necessary to treat the 
 applicable Loans and or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders as a new Class of loans and or 
 commitments hereunder provided that (x) no Loan Modification Agreement may provide for (i) any 
 Specified Class to be secured by any Collateral or other assets of any Group Member that does not also 
 secure the Loans and (ii) so long as any Loans are outstanding, any mandatory or voluntary prepayment 
 provisions that do not also apply to the Loans on a pro rata basis or greater than pro rata basis (or, with 
 respect to voluntary prepayments and prepayments made with proceeds of Permitted Credit Agreement 
 Refinancing Debt, on a pro rata basis, less than pro rata basis or greater than pro rata basis), (y) in the case

 may be agreed by the Borrower and the Accepting Lenders, (2) customary market terms at the time of 
 Incurrence (as determined by the Borrower in good faith) or approved by the Administrative Agent in its 
 reasonable discretion, (3) any terms that are conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents for the benefit

 of the material terms and conditions thereof or drafts of the documentation relating thereto, stating that 
 the Borrower has determined in good faith that such terms and conditions satisfy the requirements of this 
 Section 2.28(b) , and the Required Lenders shall not have notified the Borrower and the Administrative 
 Agent that they disagree with such determination (including a statement of the basis upon which each 
 such Lender disagrees) within such five (5) Business Day period, then such certificate shall be conclusive 
 evidence that such terms and conditions satisfy the requirements of this Section 2.28(b) .

 shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.17 or 11.1 to the contrary and the Borrower and the 
 Administrative Agent may amend Section 2.17 to implement any Loan Modification Agreement.

 authorized to be taken by the Loan Modification Agent herein shall be done in consultation with the 
 Administrative Agent and, with respect to the preparation of any documentation necessary or appropriate

 the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a) , agrees to issue standby letters 

138 

of credit and, to the extent agreed to by an Issuing Lender, bank guarantees and commercial letters of 
 credit providing for the payment of cash upon the honoring of a presentation thereunder (collectively, 
 Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower or the account of any of the Restricted Subsidiaries 
 provided that the Borrower shall be an applicant, shall be the primary obligor thereunder, and be fully 
 and unconditionally liable, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Restricted 
 Subsidiary that is not the Borrower) on any Business Day prior to the date that is thirty (30) days prior to 
 the Revolving Termination Date in such form as may be approved from time to time by the applicable 
 Issuing Lender provided that no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, 
 after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L C Obligations would exceed the L C Commitment, (ii) the 
 aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero or (iii) the L C 
 Obligation of such Issuing Lender would exceed its L C Sublimit. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be 
 denominated in Dollars or any Alternative Currency, (ii) have a stated amount acceptable to the relevant 
 Issuing Lender, (iii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance or 
 such longer period as is reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Lender, and (y) the date that is five (5) 
 Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date or such longer period as is reasonably acceptable 
 to the Issuing Lender, provided that any Letter of Credit with the consent of the applicable Issuing Lender 
 may provide for the renewal or extension thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event 
 extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above, except to the extent the L C Obligations under 
 such Letter of Credit have been Cash Collateralized) provided , further , that the Issuing Lenders shall not 
 renew or extend any such Letter of Credit if it has received written notice (or otherwise has knowledge) 
 that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 
 are not satisfied prior to the date of the decision to renew or extend such Letter of Credit and (iv) be 
 otherwise reasonably acceptable in all respects to the Issuing Lenders. Unless otherwise directed by the 
 Issuing Lenders, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to an Issuing Lender for 
 any such extension. Once any Letter of Credit has been issued that may be extended automatically 
 pursuant to the foregoing, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not 
 require) the Issuing Lenders to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit, including to the date that is 
 five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date. 
 (b) The Issuing Lenders shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of 
 Credit (i) if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lenders or any L C Participant to 
 exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii) if any order, judgment or decree 
 of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing 
 Lenders from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to the Issuing Lender 
 or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority 
 with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lenders shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Lenders refrain from, 
 the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the 
 Issuing Lenders with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for 
 which an Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or 
 shall impose upon each Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable 
 on the Closing Date and which each Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it or (iii) as otherwise 
 provided in Section 3.2(b) below. 
 3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit . 
 (a) The Borrower may from time to time on any Business Day occurring from (or, in 
 the case of any Letter of Credit permitted to be issued on the Closing Date, prior to) the Closing Date 
 until the Revolving Termination Date request that an Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering 
 to the relevant Issuing Lender, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, at its address for notices 

139 

specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such 
 other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may request. 
 Promptly upon receipt of any Application, the relevant Issuing Lender will confirm with the 
 Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of the Application, and if not, 
 will furnish the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless such Issuing Lender has received 
 written notice from the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to the 
 requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more of the 
 conditions contained in Section 5 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions 
 hereof, such Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other 
 papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary 
 procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall any 
 Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit (a) earlier than (i) three (3) Business Days, in the 
 case of standby Letters of Credit or similar agreements or (ii) to the extent an Issuing Lender agrees to 
 issue bank guarantees or commercial Letters of Credit, or similar agreements, such period of time as is 
 acceptable to such Issuing Lender, or (b) later than ten (10) Business Days (or in each case such shorter 
 period as may be agreed to by an Issuing Lender in any particular instance) after its receipt of the 
 Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating 
 thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be 
 agreed to by the Issuing Lenders and the Borrower. Each Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such 
 Letter of Credit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly following the issuance thereof. 
 The Administrative Agent shall promptly furnish notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including 
 the amount thereof) to the Revolving Lenders. 
 (b) Cash Collateral . (i) If an Issuing Lender has honored any full or partial drawing 
 request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L C Borrowing and the conditions 
 set forth in Section 5.2 to a Revolving Borrowing cannot then be met, (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit 
 Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly 
 undrawn, (iii) if any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the 
 Required Lenders, as applicable, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L C Obligations pursuant 
 to Section 9.2 or (iv) an Event of Default set forth under Section 9.1(g) occurs and is continuing, then the 
 Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations (in an amount 
 equal to 102 of such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such L C Borrowing or the 
 Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be), and shall do so not later than 2 00 p.m. (New York 
 City time) on (x) in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (iii) , (1) if the Borrower 
 receives notice thereof prior to 11 00 a.m. (New York City time), on any Business Day, on the Business 
 Day immediately following receipt of such notice or (2) if the Borrower receives notice thereof after 
 11 00 a.m. (New York City time), on any Business Day, on the second Business Day immediately 
 following receipt of such notice (y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (iv) , the Business Day 
 on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 9.1(g) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, 
 the Business Day immediately succeeding such day. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting 
 Lender, if any Defaulting Lender Fronting Exposure remains outstanding (after giving effect to 
 Section 2.27(a)(iv) ), then promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or each Issuing Lender, 
 the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Defaulting Lender Fronting Exposure and deliver to the 
 Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover such Defaulting Lender Fronting 
 Exposure (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender) provided that if 
 any Defaulting Lender Fronting Exposure is not Cash Collateralized in accordance with the foregoing to 
 the reasonable satisfaction of the Issuing Lenders, the Issuing Lenders shall have no obligation to issue 
 new Letters of Credit or to extend, renew or amend existing Letters of Credit to the extent Letter of Credit 
 exposure would exceed the commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders. For purposes hereof, Cash 

140 

Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of 
 the relevant Issuing Lender and the Lenders, as collateral for the L C Obligations, Cash Collateral 
 pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Lender 
 (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding 
 meanings. The Borrower hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lenders 
 and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all 
 proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in a Cash Collateral Account and may be 
 invested in readily available Cash Equivalents. If at any time the Administrative Agent reasonably 
 determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other 
 than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is 
 less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations (or in the case of Cash Collateral 
 provided with regard to Defaulting Lender Fronting Exposure, such amount of Defaulting Lender 
 Fronting Exposure, in each case that is required to be Cash Collateralized pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) ), 
 the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, 
 as additional funds to be deposited and held in a Cash Collateral Account as aforesaid, an amount equal to 
 the excess of (a) such aggregate Outstanding Amount (and or such aggregate Defaulting Lender Fronting 
 Exposure, as applicable) over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the 
 Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the 
 drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be 
 applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant Issuing Lender. To the 
 extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of such L C Obligations 
 or the Defaulting Lender Fronting Exposure, as applicable, and so long as no Event of Default has 
 occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. 
 3.3 Fees and Other Charges . 
 (a) The Borrower will pay a fee on the actual aggregate daily undrawn and unexpired 
 amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in 
 effect with respect to Term Benchmark Loans under the Revolving Facility, shared ratably among the 
 Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each applicable Fee Payment Date after the 
 issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting 
 fee of 0.125 per annum (or such lower fee as the Issuing Lenders may agree) on the actual aggregate 
 daily undrawn and unexpired amount of all such Issuing Lender s Letters of Credit outstanding during the 
 applicable period, payable quarterly in arrears on each applicable Fee Payment Date after the issuance 
 date. 
 (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse such 
 Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by the 
 Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any 
 Letter of Credit. Such costs and expenses shall be due and payable within three (3) Business Days of 
 demand and nonrefundable. 
 3.4 L C Participations . 
 (a) The Issuing Lenders irrevocably agree to grant and hereby grant to each L C 
 Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit, each L C Participant irrevocably 
 agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lenders, on the terms 
 and conditions set forth below, for such L C Participant s own account and risk an undivided interest 
 equal to such L C Participant s Revolving Percentage in the Issuing Lenders obligations and rights under 

141 

and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by an Issuing Lender thereunder. 
 Each L C Participant agrees with the Issuing Lenders that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for 
 which an Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this 
 Agreement, such L C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender s 
 address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L C Participant s Revolving Percentage of 
 the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L C Participant s obligation 
 to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, 
 including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L C Participant may 
 have against any Issuing Lender, the Borrower, any other Group Member or any other Person for any 
 reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to 
 satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5 , (iii) any adverse change in the condition 
 (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries, (iv) any breach of this 
 Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L C 
 Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of 
 the foregoing. 
 (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L C Participant to the Issuing Lenders 
 pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing 
 Lenders under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing Lenders within three (3) Business Days after the 
 date such payment is due, such L C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lenders on demand an amount 
 equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily Federal Funds Rate during the period from and 
 including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available 
 to the Issuing Lenders, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse 
 during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any 
 L C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Lenders by such L C 
 Participant within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lenders shall be 
 entitled to recover from such L C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated 
 from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility. A 
 certificate of an Issuing Lender submitted to any L C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under 
 this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
 (c) Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment under any 
 Letter of Credit and has received from any L C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in 
 accordance with Section 3.4(a) , an Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit 
 (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such 
 Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such 
 L C Participant its pro rata share thereof provided , however , that in the event that any such payment 
 received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L C 
 Participant shall return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing 
 Lender to it. 
 3.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower . Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any 
 Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lenders shall promptly 
 notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. If any drawing is paid under any Letter of 
 Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lenders for the amount of (a) the drawing so paid and 
 (b) any fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lenders in connection with such 
 payment, not later than 12 00 noon (New York City time) on (x) if such notice of drawing is received 
 prior to 10 00 a.m. (New York City time), on the first Business Day following the date such drawing is 
 paid by the Issuing Lenders and (y) otherwise, the second Business Day following the date such drawing 

142 

is paid by the Issuing Lenders (the Honor Date ). Each such payment shall be made to an Issuing 
 Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in the currency in which the applicable Letter of Credit 
 is denominated and in immediately available funds. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such Issuing 
 Lender on the Honor Date (or if any such reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the 
 Borrower for any reason), then (A) if such payment relates to an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, 
 automatically and with no further action required, the Borrower s or such other Person s obligation to 
 reimburse the applicable L C Borrowing shall be permanently converted into an obligation to reimburse 
 in Dollars the Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the Exchange Rate on the Honor Date, of such L C 
 Borrowing and (B) in the case of each L C Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the 
 applicable Issuing Lender and each relevant Issuing Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the 
 unreimbursed drawing in Dollars (in the case of an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, using the 
 Exchange Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency in relation to Dollars in effect on the date of 
 determination) (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such relevant Issuing Lender s 
 Applicable Percentage thereof. In the event that the Borrower does not reimburse the Issuing Lender on 
 the Business Day following the date it receives notice of the Honor Date (or, if the Borrower shall have 
 received such notice later than 12 00 noon (New York City time) on any Business Day, on the second 
 succeeding Business Day), the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of 
 ABR Loans to be disbursed on such date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard 
 to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.5 for the principal amount of ABR Loans but subject 
 to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments, and subject to the conditions set 
 forth in Section 5.2 (other than the delivery of a Borrowing Notice). Any notice given by an Issuing 
 Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.5 may be given by telephone if 
 immediately confirmed in writing provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not 
 affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, if any drawing 
 occurs under a Letter of Credit and such drawing is not reimbursed on the same day, such drawing shall, 
 without duplication, accrue interest at the rate applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility until 
 the date of reimbursement. If the Borrower fails to reimburse an Issuing Lender on the Honor Date, 
 interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant drawing is paid until 
 payment in full at the rate set forth in (x) until the second Business Day next succeeding the date of the 
 relevant notice, Section 2.14(b) and (y) thereafter, Section 2.14(c). 
 3.6 Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute 
 and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense 
 to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lenders, any beneficiary of a 
 Letter of Credit or any other Person (it being understood that this provision shall not preclude the ability 
 of the Borrower to bring any claim for damages against any such Person who has acted with bad faith, 
 gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined in a final and non-appealable decision of a court of 
 competent jurisdiction). The Borrower also agree with the Issuing Lenders that the Issuing Lenders shall 
 not be responsible for, and the Borrower s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be 
 affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements 
 thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged or any dispute 
 between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which 
 such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any 
 beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee provided that the foregoing shall not be 
 construed to excuse an Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages 
 (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to 
 the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by an 
 Issuing Lender s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented 
 under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the 

143 

absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Lender (as finally 
 determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (that is not subject to appeal)), such Issuing Lender shall 
 be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. The Issuing Lenders shall not be liable for 
 any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, 
 however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a 
 final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross 
 negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lenders. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or 
 omitted by the Issuing Lenders under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or 
 documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct or, in the case of 
 determinations of whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the 
 terms thereof, if done in the absence of bad faith (in each case, as determined in a final and non- 
 appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction), shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not 
 result in any liability of the Issuing Lenders to the Borrower. 
 3.7 Letter of Credit Payments . If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter 
 of Credit, the Issuing Lenders shall promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The 
 responsibility of the Issuing Lenders to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment 
 under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such 
 Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such 
 Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit. 
 3.8 Applications . To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of 
 Credit, or any other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the 
 Issuing Lenders or any other Person relating to any Letter of Credit, is inconsistent with the provisions of 
 this Section 3 , the provisions of this Section 3 shall control. 
 3.9 Letter of Credit Amounts . Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of 
 Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time 
 provided , however , that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms (or the terms of any 
 applicable Application or other document, agreement or instrument entered into by the applicable Issuing 
 Lender and the Borrower (or Restricted Subsidiary, if applicable) or in favor of the applicable Issuing 
 Lender and relating to such Letter of Credit) provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated 
 amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of 
 such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount 
 is in effect at such time. 
 3.10 Existing Letters of Credit . Each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed a Letter of 
 Credit issued hereunder by the applicable Issuing Lender for all purposes under this Agreement without 
 need for further action by the Borrower or any other Person. 
 SECTION 4.

 (c) For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 7.2 , in the event that 
 an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria 
 of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred as Ratio Debt, the 
 Borrower shall, in its sole discretion, at the time of Incurrence, divide and or classify, or at any later time 
 redivide and or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any 

169 

portion thereof) in one or more of the categories (including in part in one category and in part in another 
 category set forth in this Section 7.2 (including Ratio Debt)). The Borrower will also be entitled to 
 divide, classify or reclassify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Permitted Debt 
 described in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 7.2 without giving pro forma effect to the Indebtedness, 
 Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) Incurred as part of the same transaction or 
 substantially concurrent series of related transactions pursuant to clause (a) or clause (b) of this 
 Section 7.2 when calculating the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any 
 portion thereof) that may be Incurred pursuant to this Section 7.2 . Other than with respect to 
 clauses (b)(i) of this Section 7.2 , if at any time that the Borrower would be entitled to have incurred any 
 then-outstanding item of Indebtedness as Ratio Debt or pursuant to clause (b)(vi)(x) of this Section 7.2 , 
 such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness incurred as 
 Ratio Debt or pursuant to clause (b)(vi)(x) of this Section 7.2 . For the avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness 
 Incurred under clauses (b)(i) of this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to have been Incurred solely pursuant to 
 such clause (even if such Indebtedness has been refinanced pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(xvi) and shall not 
 be permitted to be reclassified and shall be deemed to have been Incurred solely pursuant to such specific 
 subclause and shall not be permitted to be reclassified as Indebtedness Incurred under the other subclause 
 thereof. For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 7.2 , with respect to Indebtedness 
 Incurred, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to cash sweep provisions or any similar 
 provisions that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically) shall 
 only be deemed for purposes of this Section 7.2 to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was 
 first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. Accrual of interest, the 
 accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form 
 of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or 
 Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same 
 class, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding 
 solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence 
 of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this Section 7.2 (and, for the 
 avoidance of doubt, no such amounts count against any basket amount under this Section 7.2) . For the 
 avoidance of doubt, the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only 
 once. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that is 
 otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in 
 the determination of such amount of Indebtedness, provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness 
 represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this 
 Section 7.2 . 
 (d) For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction 
 on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated 
 in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date 
 such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever 
 yields the lower Dollar-equivalent amount), in the case of revolving credit debt provided that if such 
 Indebtedness is Incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such 
 refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the 
 relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated 
 restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing 
 Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being Refinanced plus the 

170 

aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in 
 connection with such refinancing. 
 (e) The accrual of interest and the accretion of accreted value and the payment of 
 interest in the form of additional Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for 
 purposes of this Section 7.2 or incurrence of a Lien pursuant to Section 7.7. The principal amount of any 
 non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be 
 the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Borrower dated such date 
 prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 the criteria of more than one of the categories set forth above, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion , at 
 the time of such Restricted Payment is made, divide, classify or reclassify, or at any later time divide, 
 classify, or reclassify, such Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with

 conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other person at any time of any

 respect of all or any part of the Guarantor Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee 
 therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. The Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be 
 binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantors and the successors and

 and assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement there may be no 
 Guarantor Obligations outstanding.

 automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the

 performance by it of its Guarantee, whether by subrogation, right of contribution or otherwise, against the 
 Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, or any other Guarantor of any of the Guarantor Obligations 
 or any security for any of the Guarantor Obligations. 
 8.5 Remedies . Each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees that, as between the Guarantors 
 and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower and the UK Borrower, as applicable, under this 
 Agreement and the Notes, if any, may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in 

190

 provided in Section 9 for purposes of Section 8.1 , notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other 
 prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and 
 payable) as against the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, or any Guarantor and that, in the 
 event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and 
 payable, or the circumstances occurring where Section 9 provides that such obligations shall become due

 federal, state, provincial or territorial, corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company law, or 
 any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the 
 rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 8.1 would otherwise be 
 held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any 
 other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 8.1 , then, notwithstanding any other 
 provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability of such Guarantor shall, without any further action 
 by such Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the 
 highest amount (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 8.10 that is valid 
 and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or 
 proceeding. To effectuate the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably 
 agree that the Guarantor Obligations of each Guarantor in respect of the Guarantee at any time shall be 
 limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Guarantor Obligations of such Guarantor with respect 
 thereto hereof not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance after giving full effect to the liability 
 under such Guarantee and its related contribution rights but before taking into account any liabilities 
 under any other guarantee by such Guarantor. For purposes of the foregoing, all guarantees of such 
 Guarantor other than its Guarantee will be deemed to be enforceable and payable after the Guarantee. To 
 the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this Section 8.8 shall be for the benefit solely of creditors 
 and representatives of creditors of each Guarantor and not for the benefit of such Guarantor or the holders 
 of any Equity Interest in such Guarantor. 
 8.9 Release of Guarantors . A Guarantor (including the UK Borrower) shall be automatically 
 released from its obligations hereunder in the event that such Guarantor shall become an Excluded 
 Subsidiary or that all the Capital Stock of such Guarantor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed 
 of to a Person other than a Loan Party, in each case in a transaction permitted by this Agreement 
 provided that the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Documents solely as a 
 result of such Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary of the type described in clause (i) of the 
 definition thereof shall only be permitted if such Guarantor becomes such an Excluded Subsidiary 
 pursuant to a transaction with a third party that is not otherwise an Affiliate of the Borrower and such 
 transaction was not for the primary purpose of release the Guarantee of such Guarantor. In connection 
 with any such release of a Guarantor provided that the Borrower shall have provided the Administrative 
 Agent with such confirmation or documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request), the 
 Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to the Borrower, at the Borrower s expense, all UCC 
 termination statements and other documents that the Borrower shall reasonably request to evidence such 
 release.

 shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall 
 be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not 
 paid its proportionate share of such payment, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive 
 contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of 
 such payment. Each Guarantor s right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of

 in respect of the UK Borrower Obligations would constitute unlawful financial assistance, then, to the 
 extent necessary to give effect to the foregoing paragraphs (and only to the extent legally effective in the

 the obligations under the Loan Documents. The Tranche 2 obligations will be excluded from the relevant 
 UK Borrower Obligations.

 amounts of L C Obligations, whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters of Credit 
 shall have presented the documents required thereunder) shall automatically immediately become due and 

195 

payable, and (y) if any other Event of Default (other than under Section 9.1(g)(i) or (ii) in respect of the

 Revolving Lenders terminate the Revolving Commitments and accelerate all Obligations in respect of the 
 Revolving Commitments provided , however , that the Required Lenders may not take such actions if

 Collateral Account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under 
 such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or 
 been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other Obligations of the Borrower hereunder and 
 under the other Loan Documents. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn 

196

 Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall have been paid in full (other than (i)

 above in this Section 9.2 , presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby 
 expressly waived by the Borrower. 
 (e) Further, notwithstanding any other provisions herein or in the other Loan 
 Documents to the contrary, (x) no Event of Default shall be treated as having occurred, no representation 
 shall be treated as being untrue or inaccurate and no undertaking shall be treated as having been breached 
 if the relevant Event of Default, untruth or inaccuracy or breach would not have occurred but for any 
 fluctuation in exchange rates (in the case of any permitted Indebtedness and Liens that contain a 
 limitation expressed in dollars and that, as a result of changes in exchange rates, is so exceeded, such debt 
 will be permitted to be refinanced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing, such 
 excess shall continue) and (y) any Default or Event of Default (including any Default or Event of Default 
 (or similar term) resulting from a failure to provide notice of a Default or Event of Default) shall be 
 deemed not to exist or be continuing if (i) with respect to any Default or Event of Default that occurs 
 due to a failure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action (including taking any action 
 by a specified time), the Borrower or such Subsidiary takes such action, or (ii) with respect to any Default 
 or Event of Default that occurs due to the taking of any action by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries 
 that is not then permitted, on the earlier to occur of (A) the date such action would not be prohibited to be 
 taken pursuant to an applicable amendment or waiver permitting such action, or otherwise, and (B) the 
 date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised 
 action to be non-prohibited at such time (including after giving effect to any amendments or waivers) 
 provided that any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice of Default or 
 Event of Default shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of 
 Default giving rise to such notice requirement shall have ceased to exist and or be cured provided, 
 further, that the ability to cure pursuant to this clause (e) shall not apply with respect to any Default or 
 Event of Default if the Borrower or such Subsidiary had knowledge of such Default or Event of Default 
 and failed to give timely notice thereof to the Administrative Agent in breach of its obligations under the 
 Facilities Documentation. 
 9.3 Right to Cure . 
 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9 , in the event that 
 the Borrower fails (or, but for the operation of this Section 9.3 , would fail) to comply with the

 quarter and or from the date of delivery of a Notice of Intent to Cure with respect to the fiscal quarter

 Right ), and upon the receipt by the Borrower of such cash (the Cure Amount pursuant to the exercise 
 by the Borrower of such Cure Right, the Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio shall be recalculated by 

197

 Basis by an amount equal to the Cure Amount (x) solely for the purpose of measuring the Total First Lien 
 Net Leverage Ratio and not for any other purpose under this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
 (including for purposes of determining pricing, mandatory prepayments and the availability or amount 
 permitted pursuant to any covenant under Section 7 for the quarter with respect to which such Cure Right 
 was exercised and (y) there shall be no reduction in Indebtedness in connection with any Cure Amounts 
 for determining compliance with Section 7.1 and no Cure Amounts will reduce (or count towards) the 
 Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio 
 for purposes of any calculation thereof for the fiscal quarter with respect to which such Cure Right was 
 exercised unless the proceeds are actually applied to prepay Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.11 . 
 (b) If, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the Borrower shall then be 
 in compliance with the requirements of Section 7.1 , then the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied 
 the requirements of Section 7.1 as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though 
 there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of 
 Section 7.1 that had occurred shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement. 
 (c) To the extent a fiscal quarter ended for which the Total First Lien Net Leverage 
 Ratio was initially recalculated as a result of a Cure Right and such fiscal quarter is included in the 
 calculation of the Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio in a subsequent fiscal quarter, the Cure Amount 
 shall be included in Consolidated EBITDA of such initial fiscal quarter.

 period there shall be at least two fiscal quarters in which the Cure Right is not exercised, (ii) for purposes 
 of this Section 9.3 , the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount required for purposes of 
 complying with the Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, determined at the time the Cure Right is 
 exercised with respect to the fiscal quarter ended for which the Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio was 
 initially recalculated as a result of a Cure Right, (iii) the Cure Amount shall be disregarded for all other 
 purposes of this Agreement, including, determining any baskets with respect to the covenants contained in 
 Section 7 , and shall not result in any adjustment to any amounts other than the amount of Consolidated 
 EBITDA as described in clause (a) above, (iv) there shall be no pro forma reduction in Indebtedness with 
 the proceeds of any Cure Amount for the fiscal quarter in respect of which the Cure Right is exercised for 
 purposes of determining compliance with Section 7.1 provided that such Cure Amount shall reduce 
 Indebtedness in future fiscal quarters to the extent used to prepay any applicable Indebtedness, (v) the 
 Borrower shall not exercise the Cure Right in excess of five instances over the term of this Agreement 
 and (vi) no Revolving Lender or Issuing Lender shall be required to make any Revolving Loans or issue, 
 amend, modify, renew or extend any Letter of Credit hereunder if a violation of Section 7.1 has occurred 
 and is continuing until the expiration of the 10 Business Day period during which the Borrower may 
 exercise a Cure Right, unless and until the Cure Amount is actually received.

 performance thereof by such Incremental Arranger, Refinancing Arranger or Loan Modification Agent 
 shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent or such Incremental Arranger, 
 Refinancing Arranger or Loan Modification Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 10 and of 

208 

Section 11.5 (obligating the Borrower to pay the Administrative Agent s expenses and to indemnify the 
 Administrative Agent) that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of the 
 Administrative Agent and such Incremental Arranger, Refinancing Arranger or Loan Modification Agent 
 and all references therein to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the 
 Administrative Agent and or such Incremental Arranger, Refinancing Arranger or Loan Modification 
 Agent, as the context may require. Each Lender and Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably appoints any 
 Incremental Arranger, Refinancing Arranger or Loan Modification Agent to act on its behalf hereunder 
 and under the other Loan Documents pursuant to (and subject to) Sections 2.25 , 2.26 and 2.28 , as 
 applicable, and designates and authorizes such Incremental Arranger, Refinancing Arranger or Loan 
 Modification Agent to take such actions on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each 
 other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to 
 such Incremental Arranger, Refinancing Arranger or Loan Modification Agent by the terms of this 
 Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably 
 incidental thereto. 
 10.15 Credit Bidding. The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative 
 Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations 
 (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations 
 pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or 
 through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof 
 conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of 
 the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or 
 (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the 
 consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in 
 accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations 
 owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent at 
 the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or 
 unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest 
 upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent 
 claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the 
 equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection 
 with such purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to 
 form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle 
 or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall 
 be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for 
 the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents 
 providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the 
 Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the 
 assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing 
 documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees 
 under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or 
 vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect 
 to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 11.1 of this Agreement ), (iv) 
 the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to 
 each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, 
 interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in 
 any such acquisition vehicle and or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the 
 need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that 
 Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as 

209 

a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the 
 acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), 
 such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their original 
 interest in such Obligations and the equity interests and or debt instruments issued by any acquisition 
 vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured 
 Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. In the event of a foreclosure by the 
 Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or a sale of any of the 
 Collateral pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or an equivalent process in any foreign 
 jurisdiction), the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such 
 Collateral at any such sale and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Lenders 
 (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders 
 shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, with the consent or at the direction of the Required 
 Lenders, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any 
 portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on 
 account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale. 
 Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to 
 the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such 
 documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and or any designee of the Secured 
 Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the 
 Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, 
 the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by 
 such credit bid. 
 10.16 Acknowledgements of Lenders and Issuing Banks . 
 (i) Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such 
 Lender that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such

 erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to such Lender), and demands the return of

 Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as 
 to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each

 compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender 
 shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or 
 right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative 
 Agent for the return of any Payments received, including without limitation any defense based on 
 discharge for value or any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender under 
 this Section 10.16 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (ii) Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the 
 Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date 
 from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with 
 respect to such Payment (a Payment Notice or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment 
 Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment. 
 Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion 

210 

thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such 
 occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than 
 one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or 
 portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in 
 respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such 
 Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds 
 Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on 
 interbank compensation from time to time in effect. 
 (iii) The Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that (x) in the event an 
 erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) are not recovered from any Lender that has received such 
 Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights 
 of such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, 
 discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party. 
 (iv) Each party s obligations under this Section 10.16 shall survive the resignation or 
 replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, 
 a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all 
 Obligations under any Loan Document. 
 (v) Each Lender represents and warrants that in participating as a Lender, it is 
 engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and in providing other facilities set forth 
 herein as may be applicable to such Lender, in each case in the ordinary course of business, and not for 
 the purpose of investing in the general performance or operations of the Borrower, or for the purpose of 
 purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument such as a security (and each 
 Lender agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing, such as a claim under the federal or 
 state securities laws).

 determination (i) derivative contracts with respect to the Loans and Commitments and such contracts that 
 are the functional equivalent thereof shall be counted at the notional amount thereof in Dollars,

 Definitions (collectively, the ISDA CDS Definitions shall be deemed to create a short position with 
 respect to the Loans and or Commitments if such Lender is a protection buyer or the equivalent thereof 

215 

for such derivative transaction and (x) the Loans or the Commitments are a Reference Obligation under 
 the terms of such derivative transaction (whether specified by name in the related documentation, 
 included as a Standard Reference Obligation on the most recent list published by Markit, if Standard 
 Reference Obligation is specified as applicable in the relevant documentation or in any other manner), 
 (y) the Loans or the Commitments would be a Deliverable Obligation under the terms of such 
 derivative transaction or (z) any of the Borrower or other Loan Parties (or its successor) is designated as a 
 Reference Entity under the terms of such derivative transactions, and (v) credit derivative transactions 
 or other derivatives transactions not documented using the ISDA CDS Definitions shall be deemed to 
 create a short position with respect to the Loans and or Commitments if such transactions are functionally 
 equivalent to a transaction that offers the Lender protection in respect of the Loans or the Commitments, 
 or as to the credit quality of any of the Borrower or other Loan Parties other than, in each case, as part of 
 an index so long as (x) such index is not created, designed, administered or requested by such Lender and 
 (y) the Borrower and other Loan Parties and any instrument issued or guaranteed by any of the Borrower 
 or other Loan Parties, collectively, shall represent less than 5 of the components of such index. In 
 connection with any such determination, each Lender (other than (x) any Lender that is a Regulated Bank 
 and (y) any Revolving Lender as of the Closing Date) shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in 
 writing that it is a Net Short Lender, or shall otherwise be deemed to have represented and warranted to 
 the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not a Net Short Lender (it being understood and 
 agreed that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on each such representation and deemed 
 representation and shall have no duty to (x) inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any such 
 representation or deemed representation or (y) otherwise ascertain or monitor whether any Lender, 
 Eligible Assignee or Participant or prospective Lender, Eligible Assignee or Participant is a Net Short 
 Lender or make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any derivative contracts 
 and or net short positions). Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (A) be 
 responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, 
 compliance with the provisions hereof relating to the Net Short Lenders or (B) have any liability with

 Commitments and the Loans owing to it) provided that (A) such Lender s obligations under this 
 Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties 
 hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
 Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in 
 connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to 
 which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to 
 enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this 

226 

Agreement provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of

 between the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries and the Lenders, whether now existing or 
 hereafter arising and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or 
 event whatsoever, whether by acceleration of maturity hereof or otherwise, shall the amount paid or 
 agreed to be paid in the aggregate to the Lenders as interest (whether or not designated as interest, and 
 including any amount otherwise designated but deemed to constitute interest by a court of competent 
 jurisdiction) hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or in any other agreement given to secure the 
 Indebtedness evidenced hereby or other Obligations of the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, 
 or in any other document evidencing, securing or pertaining to the Indebtedness evidenced hereby, exceed 
 the maximum amount permissible under applicable usury or such other laws (the Maximum Amount ). 
 If under any circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any provision hereof, or any of the other Loan 
 Documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the 
 Maximum Amount, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the Maximum 
 Amount. For the purposes of calculating the actual amount of interest paid and or payable hereunder in 
 respect of laws pertaining to usury or such other laws, all sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder

 shall control and supersede every other provision of all agreements between the Borrower or the UK 
 Borrower, as applicable, or any endorser of the Loans and the Lenders. 
 (b) If under any circumstances any Lender shall ever receive an amount which would 
 exceed the Maximum Amount, such amount shall be deemed a payment in reduction of the principal 
 amount of the Loans and shall be treated as a voluntary prepayment under Section 2.10 and shall be so 
 applied in accordance with Section 2.17 or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of the 
 Loans and any other Indebtedness of the Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable, in favor of such 
 Lender, the excess shall be deemed to have been a payment made by mistake and shall be refunded to the 
 Borrower or the UK Borrower, as applicable. 
 11.21 Lender Action . Each Lender agrees that it shall not take or institute any actions or 
 proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any right or remedy against any Loan Party or any other obligor

 banker s lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help), or institute any actions or proceedings, or 
 otherwise commence any remedial procedures, with respect to any Collateral or any other property of any 
 such Loan Party, unless expressly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, without the prior 

233 

written consent of the Administrative Agent. The provisions of this Section 11.21 are for the sole benefit 
 of the Lenders and shall not afford any right to, or constitute a defense available to, any Loan Party. 
 11.22 No Fiduciary Duty . Each of the Lender-Related Parties may have economic interests that 
 conflict with those of the Loan Parties, their stockholders and or their Affiliates. Each Loan Party agrees

 agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender-Related Party, on the one 
 hand, and such Loan Party, its stockholders or its Affiliates, on the other, except as otherwise explicitly 
 provided herein. The Loan Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the 
 Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm s- 
 length commercial transactions between the Lender-Related Parties, on the one hand, and the Loan 
 Parties, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender- 
 Related Party has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Loan Party, its 
 stockholders or its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of 
 rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any 
 Lender-Related Party has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Loan Party, its stockholders or 
 its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Loan Party except the obligations expressly 
 set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender-Related Party is acting solely as principal and not as 
 the agent or fiduciary of any Loan Party, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person, 
 except as otherwise explicitly provided herein. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that it has 
 consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible 
 for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading 
 thereto. Each Loan Party agrees that it will not claim that any Lender-Related Party has rendered 
 advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Loan Party, in 
 connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 
 11.23 Acknowledgments Regarding any Supported QFCs . 
 To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or 
 otherwise, for Swap Obligations or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, QFC 
 Credit Support and each such QFC, a Supported QFC ), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows 
 with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal 
 Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
 (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes in respect 
 of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding 
 that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the 
 State of New York and or of the United States or any other state of the United States) 
 In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a Covered Party 
 becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported 
 QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such 
 Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC 
 or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer 
 would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit 
 Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United 
 States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered 
 Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the 
 Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may 
 be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such 

234 

Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and 
 the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. 
 Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties 
 with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to 
 a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. 
 11.24 Joint and Several Liability of the Borrower and the UK Borrower . To the fullest extent 
 permitted by law, the Borrower and the UK Borrower shall be jointly and severally liable for the

 Revolving Facility. Such liabilities shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, without regard to 
 (i) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the obligations 
 hereunder or thereunder or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with 
 respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Borrower or the UK Borrower, (ii) any 
 defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance hereunder provided 
 that no Borrower hereby waives any suit for breach of a contractual provision of any of the Loan 
 Documents) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by such other applicable Borrower or 
 (iii) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of such other applicable 
 Borrower or such Borrower) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal 
 discharge of such other applicable Borrower for the obligations hereunder or under any other Loan 
 Document, or of such Borrower under this Section 11.24 , in bankruptcy or in any other instance. 
 11.25 Appointment of the Borrower
