Comparable sales decreased 9.3 in the third quarter of 2024 and 6.4 year to date 2024. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channel by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes all store and digital sales, except sales from stores open less than twelve months, stores that have been closed, and stores that have been relocated where square footage has changed by more than 10 . 
 Digital sales decreased 7 in the third quarter of 2024 and 5 year to date 2024. Digital penetration represented 26 of net sales in the third quarter and year to date 2024, compared to 26 in the third quarter of 2023 and 25 year to date 2023. We measure the change in digital sales by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores. We measure digital penetration as digital sales over net sales. These amounts do not take into consideration fulfillment node, digital returns processed in stores, and coupon behaviors. 
 Comparable sales and digital penetration measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation and digital penetration may not be consistent with the similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 Other revenue includes revenue from credit card operations, third-party advertising on our website, unused gift cards and merchandise return cards (breakage), and other non-merchandise revenue. 
 Other revenue decreased 8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 30 million year to date 2024. The decrease in both periods was driven by our credit business, which declined in line with Net sales. Additionally, year to date the decrease was driven by increasing credit loss rates within our credit business. 
 As it relates to our credit business and recent regulatory developments, on March 5, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a final rule reducing the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees and eliminating the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount. This rule could adversely impact Kohl s credit card revenues, particularly if our mitigation efforts are not successful and/or if consumer behavior changes in response to our mitigation strategies or the rule itself. 
 While the rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024 industry organizations challenged the rule, and on May 10, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted a preliminary injunction, staying implementation of the rule. As of November 2, 2024, this injunction remains in effect. The ultimate outcome of this legal challenge, including its impact on the rule s effectiveness and implementation, remains uncertain. 
 We are actively pursuing various mitigation strategies should the rule become effective, including scaling our recently launched co-brand card and implementing other initiatives with Capital One, our credit partner. We continue to closely monitor developments on the issue and assess the potential impacts of the rule on our business.

Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping expenses for digital sales; and terms cash discount. Our cost of merchandise sold may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center and buying costs in selling, general, and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. 
 Gross margin is calculated as net sales less cost of merchandise sold. For the third quarter of 2024, gross margin was 39.1 of net sales, an increase of 20 basis points to last year. Year to date 2024, gross margin was 39.4 of net sales, an increase of 42 basis points to last year. In both the third quarter and year to date 2024, the increase was driven by strong inventory management resulting in fewer clearance markdowns as our inventory was down 3 to last year at the end of the third quarter as well as lower freight costs. Partially offsetting the increase in the third quarter was higher digital penetration and increased promotional activity. Year to date, the increase was partially offset by elevated shrink levels.

SG A includes compensation and benefit costs (including stores, corporate, buying, and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution, and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities other than expenses to fulfill digital sales; marketing expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; expenses related to our credit card operations; and other administrative revenues and expenses. We do not include depreciation and amortization in SG A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. 
 Many of our expenses, including store payroll and distribution costs, are variable in nature. These costs generally increase as sales increase and decrease as sales decrease. We measure our expenses as a percentage of revenue and changes in this percentage compared to the prior year. If the expense as a percent of revenue decreased from the prior year, the expense "leveraged". If the expense as a percent of revenue increased over the prior year, the expense "deleveraged".

The decreases in SG A expenses for the third quarter and year to date 2024 were due to tightly managing expenses across the organization, especially in corporate and store-related expenses. Partially offsetting the year to date decrease were investments in marketing and technology to support new growth initiatives.

The decrease in Depreciation and amortization in the third quarter and year to date 2024 was primarily driven by reduced capital spending in technology. Partially offsetting the decrease in both periods were increased store investments, including Sephora shops. 
 Net interest expense decreased in the third quarter and year to date 2024 due to a lower average outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and reduced outstanding unsecured senior debt. Year to date 2024, decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a 5 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in connection with a voluntary redemption of the remaining 113 million of outstanding 9.50 notes due May 15, 2025 completed in June 2024.

The third quarter and year to date 2024 and 2023 rates reflect the recognition of favorable tax items in both years. Due to lower pre-tax income, the favorable discrete items had a greater impact in 2024. 
 Seasonality and Inflation 
 Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences. Sales and income are typically higher during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 
 We expect that our operations will continue to be influenced by general economic conditions, including food, fuel and energy prices, employment rates, wage inflation, and costs to source our merchandise, including tariffs. There can be no assurances that such factors will not impact our business in the future.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capital Allocation 
 Our capital allocation strategy is to invest to maximize our overall long-term return and maintain a strong balance sheet, with a long-term objective of achieving an investment grade rating. We follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities: first we invest in our business to drive long-term profitable growth; second we pay a quarterly dividend; third we will complete debt reduction transactions, when appropriate; and fourth we return excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. 
 We will continue to invest in the business, as we plan to invest approximately 500 million in 2024, which includes the investment in 140 small format Sephora shop openings, 350 impulse queuing lines, the launch of 200 Babies R Us shops, and six new store openings, including one relocation. We remain committed to the dividend, and on November 13, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.50 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 24, 2024 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11, 2024. In June 2024, we completed a voluntary redemption of the remaining 113 million of outstanding 9.50 notes due May 15, 2025. We are not planning any share repurchases during the current year. 
 Our period-end Cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to 174 million from 190 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our Cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of 7 million and 11 million as of November 2, 2024, and October 28, 2023, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. 
 The following table presents our primary uses and sources of cash:

Operating Activities 
 Our operating cash outflows generally consist of payments to our employees for wages, salaries and other employee benefits, payments to our merchandise vendors for inventory (net of vendor allowances), payments to our shipping carriers, and payments to our landlords for rent. Operating cash outflows also include payments for income taxes and interest payments on our debt borrowings.

Table of Contents 

 Operating activities generated 52 million of cash year to date 2024 compared to 379 year to date 2023. Operating cash flow decreased primarily due to lower net income and the timing of payments year over year. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing cash outflows include payments for capital expenditures, including investments in new and existing stores, improvements to supply chain, and technology costs. Our investing cash inflows are generally from proceeds from sales of property, equipment, and real estate. 
 Investing activities used 363 million of cash year to date 2024 and 491 million year to date 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by fewer Sephora shop openings and other investments, consistent with our reduced capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2024. 
 At the end of the quarter, we had a Sephora presence in over 1,000 of our stores, including 862 full size 2,500 square foot shops and 190 small format Sephora shops. In 2024, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 500 million, which includes the investment in 140 small format Sephora shop openings, 350 impulse queuing lines, the launch of 200 Babies R Us shops, and six new store openings, including one relocation. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing strategy is to ensure adequate liquidity and access to capital markets. We also strive to maintain a balanced portfolio of debt maturities, while minimizing our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the public debt market has provided us with adequate sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. 
 During the first half of 2024, Fitch downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB- to BB and revised their outlook to stable. While Moody's reaffirmed our credit rating, they also revised their outlook to stable. 
 As of November 2, 2024, our senior unsecured credit ratings and outlook were as follows:

The majority of our financing activities generally include proceeds and/or repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, dividend payments, and repurchases of common stock. Financing cash outflows also include payments to our landlords for leases classified as financing leases and financing obligations. 
 Financing activities generated 302 million of cash year to date 2024 and 149 million of cash year to date 2023. 
 Year to date 2024, we drew 657 million on our 1.5 billion credit facility compared to 540 million drawn year to date 2023. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility, recorded as short-term debt, had 749 million outstanding as of November 2, 2024, and had 625 million outstanding as of October 28, 2023. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we completed a voluntary redemption of the remaining 113 million of outstanding 9.50 notes due May 15, 2025. In February 2023, 164 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.25 notes matured and was repaid. 
 There was no cash used for treasury stock purchases year to date 2024 or 2023. Share repurchases are discretionary in nature. The timing and amount of repurchases are based upon available cash balances, our stock price, and other factors. As previously noted, we are not planning any share repurchases during the current year.

Working capital

Current ratio 
 1.05 
 1.14 

Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season. 
 The decrease in our working capital and current ratio are driven by increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility and additional long-term debt due within the next year. Additionally, the decrease is driven by a decrease in inventory due to inventory management as our receipts were down 7 versus the prior year. We placed a lower percentage of our overall receipts in the early part of the buying cycle to allow for additional flexibility to chase receipts based on trending sales, establish a better flow of goods to our stores, and maintain better in-stock positions, with the goal of minimizing the impact of future markdowns and out-of-stock positions. 
 Debt Covenant Compliance 
 Our senior secured, asset based revolving credit facility contains customary events of default and financial, affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to, a springing financial covenant relating to our fixed charge coverage ratio and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, asset dispositions, and restricted payments. As of November 2, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Aside from the voluntary redemption of the remaining 113 million of outstanding 9.50 notes due May 15, 2025 and the change in borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which have been disclosed in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, there have been no significant changes in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not provided any financial guarantees arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons as of November 2, 2024. 
 We have not created, and are not a party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt, or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, or capital resources. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of its estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (the Evaluation at a reasonable assurance level as of the last day of the period covered by this report. 
 Based upon the Evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
