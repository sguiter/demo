 Based on current facts and circumstances, the Company believes the unrealized losses presented in the September 30, 2024 securities in a gross unrealized loss position tables above are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities, but rather are primarily attributable to changes in risk-free interest rates. In reaching this determination, the Company considered the volatility in risk-free rates and credit spreads as well as the fact that its unrealized losses are concentrated in investment grade issuers. Additionally, the Company has no current intent to sell securities with unrealized losses, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost; accordingly, the Company has determined that there are no additional impairment losses to be recorded as of September 30, 2024.

 billion of net A EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of billion. The billion of claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to NICO was net of billion of ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under existing third-party reinsurance contracts. The NICO LPT aggregate reinsurance limit also covers credit risk on the existing third-party reinsurance related to these liabilities. The Company paid NICO a reinsurance premium of billion and transferred to NICO billed third-party reinsurance receivables related to A EP claims with a net book value of million, resulting in total consideration of billion. 
 In years subsequent to the effective date of the LPT, the Company recognized adverse prior year development on its A EP reserves resulting in additional amounts ceded under the LPT. As a result, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT have exceeded the billion consideration paid, resulting in the NICO LPT moving into a gain position, requiring retroactive reinsurance accounting. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, this gain is deferred and only recognized in earnings in proportion to actual paid recoveries under the LPT. Over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses incurred are within the limit of the LPT. In a period in which the Company recognizes a change in the estimate of A EP reserves that increases or decreases the amounts ceded under the LPT, the proportion of actual paid recoveries to total ceded losses is affected and the change in the deferred gain is recognized in earnings as if the revised estimate of ceded losses was available at the effective date of the LPT. The effect of the deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit is recorded in Insurance claims and policyholders' benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The impact of the LPT on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was the recognition of a retroactive reinsurance benefit of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT were billion. The unrecognized deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is included within Other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 NICO established a collateral trust account as security for its obligations to the Company. The fair value of the collateral trust account was billion as of September 30, 2024. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. guaranteed the payment obligations of NICO up to the aggregate reinsurance limit as well as certain of NICO s performance obligations under the trust agreement. NICO is responsible for claims handling and billing and collection from third-party reinsurers related to the majority of the Company s A EP claims.

 business segments: Specialty, Commercial and International. These segments are collectively referred to as Property Casualty Operations. The Company's operations outside of Property Casualty Operations are managed and reported in segments: Life Group and Corporate Other. 
 The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements within CNAF's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company manages most of its assets on a legal entity basis, while segment operations are generally conducted across legal entities. As such, only Insurance and Reinsurance receivables, Insurance reserves, Deferred acquisition costs, Goodwill and Deferred non-insurance warranty acquisition expense and revenue are readily identifiable for individual segments. Distinct investment portfolios are not maintained for every individual segment; accordingly, allocation of assets to each segment is not performed. Therefore, a significant portion of Net investment income is allocated primarily based on each segment's net carried insurance reserves, as adjusted. All significant intersegment income and expense have been eliminated. Income taxes have been allocated on the basis of the taxable income of the segments. 
 In the following tables, certain financial measures are presented to provide information used by management to monitor the Company's operating performance. Management utilizes these financial measures to monitor the Company's insurance operations and investment portfolio. 
 The performance of the Company's insurance operations is monitored by management through core income (loss), which is derived from certain income statement amounts. The Company's investment portfolio is monitored by management through analysis of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities, portfolio duration and exposure to market and credit risk. 
 Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of net investment gains or losses and gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions. Net investment gains or losses are excluded from the calculation of core income (loss) because they are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of the Company's primary operations. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions as they result from decisions regarding the Company's defined benefit pension plans which are unrelated to the Company's primary operations.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD A) of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 The following discussion highlights significant factors affecting the Company. References to we, our, us or like terms refer to the business of CNA. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Item 1A Risk Factors and Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We utilize the core income (loss) financial measure to monitor our operations. Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of net investment gains or losses and gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions. Net investment gains or losses are excluded from the calculation of core income (loss) because they are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of our primary operations. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions as they result from decisions regarding our defined benefit pension plans which are unrelated to our primary operations. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure and management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate our primary operations. See further discussion regarding how we manage our business in Note J to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1. For reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and other information, please refer herein and/or to CNA's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 In evaluating the results of our Specialty, Commercial and International segments, we utilize the loss ratio, the underlying loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio, the combined ratio and the underlying combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The underlying loss ratio excludes the impact of catastrophe losses and development-related items from the loss ratio. Development-related items represents net prior year loss reserve and premium development, and includes the effects of interest accretion and change in allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and deductible amounts. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders' dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. The underlying combined ratio is the sum of the underlying loss ratio, the expense ratio and the dividend ratio. The underlying loss ratio and the underlying combined ratio are deemed to be non-GAAP financial measures, and management believes some investors may find these ratios useful to evaluate our underwriting performance since they remove the impact of catastrophe losses which are unpredictable as to timing and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of our current year underwriting performance. 
 Changes in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year loss reserve development within this MD A. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. Net prior year loss reserve development does not include the effect of any related acquisition expenses. Further information on our reserves is provided in Note E to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1. 
 In addition, we also utilize renewal premium change, rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. Exposure represents the measure of risk used in the pricing of the insurance product. The change in exposure represents the change in premium dollars on policies that renew as a result of the change in risk of the policy. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed, excluding rate and exposure changes, in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers. Gross written premiums, excluding third-party captives, excludes business which is ceded to third-party captives, including business related to large warranty programs.

 We use underwriting gain (loss), calculated using GAAP financial results, to monitor our insurance operations. Underwriting gain (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP measure and is calculated pretax as net earned premiums less total insurance expenses, which includes insurance claims and policyholders' benefits, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other insurance related expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate the profitability, before tax, derived from our underwriting activities which are managed separately from our investing activities. Underlying underwriting gain (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP measure that represents pretax underwriting gain (loss) excluding catastrophe losses and development-related items. Management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate profitability, before tax, of our underwriting activities, excluding the impact of catastrophe losses which are unpredictable as to timing and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of our current year underwriting performance.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the amount of revenues and expenses reported during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. 
 The accounting estimates discussed below are considered by us to be critical to an understanding of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment: 
 Insurance Reserves 
 Long-Term Care Reserves 
 Reinsurance and Insurance Receivables 
 Valuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities 
 Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, equity, business, and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information.

 Three Month Comparison 
 Core income increased 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023. Core income for our Property Casualty Operations decreased 5 million primarily driven by the largely offsetting impacts of higher catastrophe losses and higher net investment income. Core loss for our Life Group segment improved 20 million, while core loss for our Corporate Other segment increased 11 million. 
 Catastrophe losses were 143 million and 94 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily related to severe weather related events. Catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 55 million for Hurricane Helene. Unfavorable net prior year loss reserve development of 17 million and 13 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to our Specialty, Commercial, International and Corporate Other segments.

 Three Month Comparison 
 Gross written premiums, excluding third-party captives, for Specialty increased 33 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023 driven by retention and higher new business. Net written premiums for Specialty increased 37 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023. The increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums. 
 Core income decreased 7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower underlying underwriting results and higher claim costs in our non-insurance auto warranty business, partially offset by higher net investment income. 
 The combined ratio of 93.0 increased 2.9 points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 2.1 point increase in the loss ratio and a 0.9 point increase in the expense ratio. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to an increase in the underlying loss ratio primarily driven by continued pricing pressure in management liability lines over the last several quarters. There was no net prior year loss reserve development recorded for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to favorable net prior year loss reserve development of 5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily driven by higher employee related costs. There were no catastrophe losses for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Three Month Comparison 
 Core loss improved 20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher net investment income. Both periods are inclusive of assumption updates as a result of the annual reserve reviews completed in the third quarter of each year. 
 The cash flow assumption updates from the annual reserve review for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted in a pretax increase in long-term care reserves of 15 million and 8 million. 
 The annual structured settlement reserve review resulted in a pretax reduction in claim reserves of 9 million and 6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Nine Month Comparison 
 Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were generally consistent with the three month summary above. 
 Future Policy Benefit Reserves 
 Annually in the third quarter, an actuarial analysis is performed on policyholder morbidity, persistency, premium rate increases and expense experience. This analysis, combined with judgment, informs the setting of updated cash flow assumptions used to estimate the liability for future policyholder benefits (LFPB). See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements within CNAF's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information on the long-term care reserving process. 
 The table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on our results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to our LFPB reserve assumptions. We have assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each long-term care product. The impact of each sensitivity is discrete and does not reflect the impact one factor may have on another or the mitigating impact from management actions, which may include additional future premium rate increases. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized below. The estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of any net premium ratio impacts.

 As part of the annual reserve review, statutory long term care reserve adequacy is evaluated via premium deficiency testing, by comparing carried statutory reserves with our best estimate reserves, which incorporates best estimate discount rate and liability assumptions in its determination. Statutory margin is the excess of carried reserves over best estimate reserves. As of September 30, 2024, statutory long term care margin increased to 1.4 billion from 1.3 billion, primarily driven by a more favorable interest rate environment resulting in a higher yielding investment portfolio.

 Duration 
 A primary objective in the management of the investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to the corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. Our views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions as well as domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. We also continually monitor exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on our views of a specific issuer or industry sector. 
 A further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long-term in nature, we segregate investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long-term care and structured settlement liabilities in the Life Group segment. 
 The effective durations of fixed income securities and short-term investments are presented in the following table. Amounts presented are net of payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions) Estimated Fair Value Effective Duration (In years) Estimated Fair Value Effective Duration (In years) Life Group 15,753 10.1 15,137 10.2 Property Casualty and Corporate Other 29,118 4.4 27,981 4.5 Total 44,871 6.4 43,118 6.5 
 The investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related price risk. Certain securities have duration characteristics that are variable based on market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that may drive variability in the amount and timing of cash flows. Additionally, we periodically review the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is included in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included under Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Our primary operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income. Our primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses, including interest expense on corporate debt. Additionally, cash may be paid or received for income taxes. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 1,868 million as compared with 1,765 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase in premiums collected and higher earnings from fixed income securities, partially offset by an increase in net claim payments and higher operating expenses. 
 Cash flows from investing activities include the purchase and disposition of financial instruments, excluding those held as trading, and may include the purchase and sale of businesses, equipment and other assets not generally held for resale. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by investing activities was 762 million as compared with 1,537 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash used or provided by investing activities is primarily driven by cash available from operations and by other factors, such as financing activities. 
 Cash flows from financing activities may include proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, and outflows for stockholder dividends, repayment of debt and purchases of our common stock. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by financing activities was 998 million as compared with 218 million for the same period in 2023. Financing activities for the periods presented include: 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we repaid the 550 million outstanding aggregate principal balance of our 3.95 senior notes which came due May 15, 2024. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we issued 500 million of 5.125 notes due February 15, 2034. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid dividends of 906 million and repurchased 450,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 20 million. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we issued 400 million of 5.50 senior notes due June 15, 2033, and in the third quarter of 2023, we issued an additional 100 million of 5.50 senior notes due June 15, 2033. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid dividends of 673 million and repurchased 550,000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 24 million.

 Common Stock Dividends 
 Cash dividends of 3.32 per share on our common stock, including a special cash dividend of 2.00 per share, were declared and paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On November 1, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.44 per share, payable December 5, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2024. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, financial condition, business needs and regulatory constraints. 
 
 Liquidity 
 We believe that our present cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are sufficient to fund our current and expected working capital and debt obligation needs and we do not expect this to change in the near term. There are currently no amounts outstanding under our 250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and no borrowings outstanding through our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLBC). 
 Dividends from Continental Casualty Company (CCC) are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance, are determined based on the greater of the prior year's statutory net income or 10 of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of September 30, 2024 CCC was in a positive earned surplus position. CCC paid dividends of 635 million and 770 million to CNAF during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company. 
 We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may publicly issue an unspecified amount of debt, equity or hybrid securities from time to time.

 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 
 For a discussion of Accounting Standards, see Note A to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1. 
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains a number of forward-looking statements which relate to anticipated future events rather than actual present conditions or historical events. These statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and generally include words such as believes, expects, intends, anticipates, estimates and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this report include any and all statements regarding expected developments in our insurance business, including losses and loss reserves (note that loss reserves for long-term care, A EP and other mass tort claims are more uncertain, and therefore more difficult to estimate than loss reserves respecting traditional property and casualty exposures); the impact of routine ongoing insurance reserve reviews we conduct; our expectations concerning our revenues, earnings, expenses and investment activities; volatility in investment returns; and our proposed actions in response to trends in our business. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to a variety of inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results projected in the forward-looking statements. We cannot control many of these risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following as well as those risks contained in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K: 
 Company-Specific Factors 
 the risks and uncertainties associated with our insurance reserves, as outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates sections of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and this report, and the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sufficiency of the reserves and the possibility for future increases, which would be reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustment is determined; 
 the risk that the other parties to the transactions in which, subject to certain limitations, we ceded our legacy A EP and excess workers' compensation (EWC) liabilities, respectively, will not fully perform their respective obligations to CNA, the uncertainty in estimating loss reserves for A EP and EWC liabilities and the possible continued exposure of CNA to liabilities for A EP and EWC claims that are not covered under the terms of the respective transactions; and 
 the performance of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts with us. 
 Industry and General Market Factors 
 general economic and business conditions, including recessionary conditions that may decrease the size and number of our insurance customers and create losses to our lines of business and inflationary pressures on medical care costs, construction costs and other economic sectors; 
 the effects of social inflation, including frequency of nuclear verdicts and increased litigation activity, on the severity of claims; 
 the effects on the frequency of claims of reviver statutes that extend, or eliminate, the statute of limitations for the reporting of claims, including statutes passed in certain states with respect to sexual molestation and sexual abuse; 
 the impact of competitive products, policies and pricing and the competitive environment in which we operate, including changes in our book of business; 
 product and policy availability and demand and market responses, including the level of ability to obtain rate increases; 
 the COVID-19 pandemic, including new or emerging variants, other potential pandemics and related measures to mitigate the spread of the foregoing may continue to result in increased claims and related litigation risk across our enterprise; 
 conditions in the capital and credit markets, including uncertainty and instability in these markets, as well as the overall economy, and their impact on the returns, types, liquidity and valuation of our investments; 
 conditions in the capital and credit markets that may limit our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms; and 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 the possibility of changes in our ratings by ratings agencies, including the inability to access certain markets or distribution channels and the required collateralization of future payment obligations as a result of such changes, and changes in rating agency policies and practices. 
 Regulatory, Legal and Operational Factors 
 regulatory and legal initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements, which are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, sometimes conflict, and could expose us to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions, including regulations related to cybersecurity protocols (which continue to evolve in breadth, sophistication and maturity in response to an ever-evolving threat landscape), legal inquiries by state authorities, judicial interpretations within the regulatory framework, including interpretation of policy provisions, decisions regarding coverage and theories of liability, legislative actions that increase claimant activity, including those revising applicability of statutes of limitations, trends in litigation and the outcome of any litigation involving us and rulings and changes in tax laws and regulations; 
 regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions upon us, including with respect to our ability to increase premium rates, and the effects of assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds and second-injury funds, other mandatory pooling arrangements and future assessments levied on insurance companies; 
 regulatory limitations and restrictions, including limitations upon our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, imposed by regulatory authorities, including regulatory capital adequacy standards; 
 breaches of our or our vendors' data security infrastructure resulting in unauthorized access to systems and information, and/or interruption of operations; and 
 regulatory and legal implications relating to the sophisticated cyber incident sustained by the Company in March 2021 that may arise. 
 Impact of Natural and Man-Made Disasters and Mass Tort Claims 
 weather and other natural physical events, including the severity and frequency of storms, hail, snowfall and other winter conditions, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados and earthquakes, as well as climate change, including effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, wildfires, rain, hail and snow; 
 regulatory requirements imposed by coastal state regulators in the wake of hurricanes or other natural disasters, including limitations on the ability to exit markets or to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies, as well as mandatory assessments to fund any shortfalls arising from the inability of quasi-governmental insurers to pay claims; 
 man-made disasters, including the possible occurrence of terrorist attacks, the unpredictability of the nature, targets, severity or frequency of such events, and the effect of the absence or insufficiency of applicable terrorism legislation on coverages; 
 the occurrence of epidemics and pandemics; and 
 mass tort claims, including those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances such as glyphosate, lead paint, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and opioids; sexual abuse and molestation claims; and claims arising from changes that repeal or weaken tort reforms. 
 Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statement, even if our expectations or any related events or circumstances change.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There were no material changes in our market risk components for the three months ended September 30, 2024. See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information. Additional information related to portfolio duration is discussed in the Investments section of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part I, Item 2. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), including this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
