Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Our disclosure and analysis in this report concerning our operations, cash flows and financial position, including, in particular, the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from our backlog, include forward-looking statements. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or that include words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Although these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described more fully herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and in Part I under the heading "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements", as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks include our ability to successfully realize the expected benefits of the business combination; our ability to operate in existing markets or expand into new jurisdictions; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to continue to operate in states where we have obtained the requisite licenses to the extent that the laws and regulations of such states clearly indicate that a license is required or where state regulators have advised us that we need a license to operate; our ability to manage regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency industry and maintain positive relationships with federal and state regulators; our dependence on key business relationships with certain key suppliers of Bitcoin; our dependence on, and ability to maintain, key business relationships with store locations for our kiosks and franchise locations, and related supplies, programs, and technologies for our business on acceptable terms; the negative impact on our future results of operations of the unknown potential growth rate and demand for Bitcoin kiosks and by the slow adoption of cryptocurrency; our heavy dependency on our ability to win, maintain and renew contracts with store location partners; unfavorable macroeconomic conditions or decreased discretionary spending due to other factors such as increased interest rates, increased inflation, high fuel rates, recessions, epidemics or other public health issues, terrorist activity or threat thereof, civil unrest or other economic or political uncertainties, that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions; and our ability to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness on satisfactory terms, liquidity and trading of our public securities. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that we will achieve the results anticipated or implied by our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

 million, including cash and cash equivalents of million, current liabilities of million, total stockholders (deficit) of million and an accumulated deficit of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized net income of million, generated positive cash flows from operations of million and had cash flows used in financing activities of million, primarily due to the issuance of notes payable, distributions and payments on finance leases. The Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operations, to be sufficient to fund its operations for a period of 12 months from the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. (d) Risks and Uncertainties The operations of Bitcoin Depot are subject to various regulatory challenges and uncertainties. The Company's ability to operate and expand its cryptocurrency kiosk services in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is a significant risk that may impact its financial performance and overall business prospects. The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies, including the operation of crypto kiosks, is rapidly evolving and can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. The impact of heightened regulatory oversight is not yet known. For example, recent legislation in California regulates digital financial asset transaction kiosks crypto kiosks by imposing (i) a limit of per day on the amount of funds the kiosk operator can accept from or dispense at its crypto kiosks; (ii) a limit on the direct and indirect charges an operator may collect from a customer for a single transaction to the greater of

Table of Contents

 or of the dollar equivalent of the digital assets involved in the transaction; (iii) requirements that specific information (including the amount of fees, expenses and charges, as well as any spread between the dollar price of the digital asset charged to the customer and the dollar price for that asset listed by a digital asset exchange) be disclosed both prior to a transaction and on transaction receipts printed by crypto kiosks following the transaction; and (iv) requiring operators to provide the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation with a list of all locations of the crypto kiosks that the operator owns, operates or manages in California. Other state agencies may propose and adopt new regulations (or interpret existing regulations) in ways that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, regardless of whether these or other new laws are adopted. The Company's financial performance and ability to achieve its business objectives may be significantly impacted by the outcome of ongoing regulatory discussions and potential changes in the regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies in California and in other states that have passed, or may pass, similar legislation. These uncertainties have resulted in lower revenue and may continue to result in lower revenue and margin, increased compliance costs, operational restrictions, or limitations on the Company's ability to expand its services or enter new markets. Compliance with current and proposed legislation that has not yet been published may be more challenging and costly than anticipated. In addition, the Company's ability to obtain and maintain the necessary licenses, permits, and approvals from state regulatory authorities is subject to various factors beyond its control, including changes in laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in penalties, fines, or even the suspension or termination of the Company's operations in the state.

 non-economic, super voting shares of Class V common stock in Bitcoin Depot. The Class V common stock held by BT Assets corresponds to units held by BT Assets in BT HoldCo and represents non-controlling interests in the Company, as described in Note 11. Following the closing of the Merger, the Company is organized under an Up-C structure in which the business of the Company is operated by BT HoldCo and its subsidiaries, and Bitcoin Depot s only material direct asset consists of equity interests in BT HoldCo. At June 30, 2023, the Company had issued and outstanding common units, Series A Preferred Units and warrants in BT HoldCo. Also at June 30, 2023, BT Assets owned common units, Founder Preferred Units, Class 1 Earnout Units, Class 2 Earnout Units and Class 3 Earnout Units in BT HoldCo. Notwithstanding the legal form of the Merger pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. The Merger was accounted for as a common control transaction and reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), as BT Assets controls BT OpCo both before and after the transactions. Legacy Bitcoin Depot is determined to be the predecessor and represents a continuation of BT OpCo s balance sheet and consolidated statement of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income, reflective of the recapitalization of the Merger. As a result of the reverse capitalization accounting, the assets and liabilities of Legacy Bitcoin Depot are reflected by the Company at their historical cost with no additional goodwill or intangible assets recorded, accompanied by a recapitalization of the equity structure. In connection with the Merger, the Company s Class A common stock is now listed on the National Association of Securities of Dealers Automated Quotations Nasdaq under the symbol BTM and the Warrants to purchase the Class A common stock are listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol BTMWW in lieu of the GSRM Ordinary Shares and GSRM s warrants, respectively. GSRM s units automatically separated into the GSRM s Ordinary Shares and GSRM s warrants and ceased trading separately on the Nasdaq following the Closing Date. Prior to the Merger, GSRM neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. Until the Merger, based on GSRM s business activities, it was a shell company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Merger reflect those of Legacy Bitcoin Depot, which represents the predecessor of the Company. All such references to the Company for periods prior to the Merger refer to the activity of Lux Vending, LLC. In connection with the Merger, the Company became the sole managing member of BT HoldCo, which holds all of the Company s operating subsidiaries, and has the sole authority to make the key operating decisions on behalf of BT HoldCo. As such, the Company determined that BT HoldCo is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of BT HoldCo.

 and shares of Series A Preferred Stock, respectively were converted to shares of Class A common stock. Warrants There are warrants outstanding of which Public Warrants were issued by GSRM at the time of its IPO and Private Warrants and together the Warrants were issued by GSRM to GSR II Meteora Sponsor LLC Sponsor ). As a result of the Merger, these Warrants became Bitcoin Depot Warrants. Each whole Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase share of Class A common stock at a price of per share. A holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants at a price of per share if the closing price of the Company s Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within a -trading day period. The Private Warrants cannot be redeemed, even if sold or transferred to a non-affiliate. The Warrants will expire after the Closing Date, June 30, 2028, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company also has the ability to redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of per Public Warrant, provided that the last reported sale price of Class A common stock for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders equals or exceeds per share and provided certain other conditions are met. The Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants, except the Private Warrants are not subject to redemption, and do not become subject to redemption after transfer to a non-affiliate (a distinction from other private placement warrants issued in connection with GSRM transactions). The Warrants are accounted for as freestanding equity contracts and are classified in equity under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. In connection with the Merger, the Warrants were recorded in connection with the reverse recapitalization accounting as part of the adjustment to accumulated deficit on the consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders (Deficit) Equity. Earnouts In connection with the Merger, the Sponsor received the Sponsor Earnout Shares, divided into three classes of Class E common stock: E-1, E-2, and E-3, respectively. All classes of Class E common stock are held by a single party. Upon achieving certain milestones (described below), each share of Class E common stock is automatically converted into shares of the Company s Class A common stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Class E common stock shares do not have any voting or economic rights, and they represent the right to receive shares of Class A common stock. In addition to the Sponsor Earnout Shares described above, BT HoldCo also issued earnout units BT HoldCo Earnout Units ), of which were issued to the Company and were issued to BT Assets, Inc. The BT HoldCo Earnout Units issued by BT HoldCo are subject to the same vesting conditions as the Sponsor Earnout Shares. Upon vesting, these units will be automatically exchanged into common units of BT HoldCo. BT HoldCo Earnout Units held by the Company mirror the Sponsor Earnout Shares arrangement as they are intended to maintain the UP-C corporation structure of the consolidated reporting group (i.e., for every share of Class A common stock outstanding, the Company will own a corresponding common unit in BT HoldCo). BT HoldCo Earnout Units issued to BT Assets, will impact the non-controlling interest recognized by the Company when they vest. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the market price of the Company's Class A common stock did not exceed the required price per share. Additionally, in accordance with the earnout provisions, the market price of the Company's Class A common stock did not exceed per share for any trading days within any consecutive trading day period after the Merger to achieve the 1st vesting hurdle. Share repurchase program On September 22, 2023, the Company announced that its Board has authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to million of outstanding shares of its Class A common stock through and including September 30, 2024. The Company made an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of purchases or sales of securities, including purchases of its own shares as part of the share repurchase program, as of the trade date.

 shares at a total cost of million with an average cost per share of . shares were repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. shares were repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024. From the date of authorization through September 30, 2024, shares of the Company's Class A common stock had been repurchased with a total cost of million. As of September 30, 2024, the program had expired. Redemptions of LLC Interests The BT HoldCo Operating Agreement provides that holders of LLC Interests may, from time to time, require the Company to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Interests for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. In connection with any redemption or exchange, the Company receives a corresponding number of LLC Interests, increasing its total ownership interest in BT HoldCo. Simultaneously, and in connection with a redemption, the corresponding number of shares of Class V common shares and Common BT HoldCo units are surrendered and cancelled. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BT Assets exchanged and Class V shares. This exchange in the second quarter of 2024 resulted in a transfer of ownership interest in BT HoldCo from BT Assets to the Company. and . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized income tax (expense) benefit of million and million, respectively, on its share of pre-tax book income (loss), of which million and million was attributed to non-controlling interest. BitAccess Inc. and Express Vending, Inc. are taxed as Canadian corporations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, there was activity for Mintz Assets, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC and Digital Gold. As such, there were federal income taxes for these entities. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate of 21.0 primarily due to the income or loss not being taxed due to the income and loss flowing through to its partners, and differences related to the foreign operations, and valuation allowance adjustments for the Company s outside basis in BT HoldCo. As of September 30, 2024, management determined based on applicable accounting standards and the weight of all available evidence, it was not more likely than not MLTN that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets for the difference in tax basis in excess of the financial reporting value for its investment in BT HoldCo. Consequently, the Company has established a full valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax asset related to its investment in BT HoldCo, as of September 30, 2024. In the event that management subsequently determines that it is MLTN that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future over the recorded amount, a decrease to the valuation allowance will be made, which will reduce the provision for income taxes. Additionally, the Company has an uncertain tax position of million due to state tax filings. The Company plans to settle open filings during 2024. Tax Receivable Agreement Upon the completion of the Merger, Bitcoin Depot is party to the Tax Receivable Agreement TRA ). Under the terms of that agreement, Bitcoin Depot generally will be required to pay BT Assets of the tax savings, if any, that Bitcoin Depot Inc. realizes, or in certain circumstances is deemed to realize, as a result of certain tax attributes that are created as part of and after the Merger. The payment of cash consideration to BT Assets in connection with the transaction will result in aggregate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. This amount does not take into account any future exchanges of BT HoldCo Common Units by BT Assets pursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement. The future amounts payable, as well as the timing of any payments, under the Tax Receivable Agreement are dependent upon significant future events, including (but not limited to) the timing of the exchanges of BT HoldCo Common Units and

Pursuant to the Company's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of BT HoldCo when units are redeemed or exchanged by the other members of BT HoldCo. The Company plans to make an election under Section 754 of the Code for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of BT HoldCo units occurs. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of BT HoldCo units as direct purchases of the units for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that would otherwise be paid in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. On April 24, 2024, the Company acquired an aggregate of million units in connection with an exchange with BT HoldCo (see Note 14), which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of its investment in BT HoldCo subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Company also recorded an additional liability of million for the TRA Payments due to the redeeming members, representing of the aggregate tax benefits the Company expects to realize from the tax basis increases related to the exchange of units, after concluding it was probable that such TRA Payments would be paid based on estimates of future taxable income. No payments were made to the members of BT HoldCo pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.

million in damages equivalent to the fees alleged to be payable for breach of contract that would have been owed upon the closing of a transaction to acquire control, the sale of substantially all the Company s assets, or a merger transaction pursuant to the previously terminated engagement letter for advisory services. Canaccord proposes that the amount of fees would be calculated on the total transaction value of the business combination that Canaccord now values at million.. The claim also seeks an award for legal and other costs relating to the proceeding. On October 25, 2023, Canaccord amended their complaint to increase the amount of the claim by million to roughly million and to add Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC as a defendant to account for the name change following the closing of the merger. The increase in the claim is the result of Canaccord changing the estimated transaction value from to million. Bitcoin Depot does not believe the allegations made against it are valid and intends to vigorously defend against them. The range of potential loss related to the identified claim is between and million, the amount of damages that Canaccord is seeking in the lawsuit. The additional costs mentioned in the claim are not able to be estimated at this time. The discovery phase of the litigation involving documentary productions and oral examinations is largely completed. A mediation of the dispute will be held at the end of fourth quarter of 2024.

Item 2. 	 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information which Bitcoin Depot s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of consolidated results of operations and financial condition. You should read the following discussion and analysis of Bitcoin Depot s financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Certain information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to plans and strategy for Bitcoin Depot s business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements Safe Harbor Statement, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to we, us, our, the Company or Bitcoin Depot refer to Bitcoin Depot Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 Business Overview 
 Bitcoin Depot owns and operates the largest network of Bitcoin ATMs BTMs across North America where customers can buy and sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin Depot helps power the digital economy for users of cash. 
 Our mission is to bring Crypto to the Masses . Digital means and systems dominate the way that consumers send money, make purchases, and invest; however, we believe that many people utilize cash as their primary means of initiating a transaction, either as a necessity or as a preference. These individuals have largely been excluded from the digital financial system and associated technological advancements in our global and digitally interconnected society. Bitcoin Depot s simple and convenient process to convert cash into Bitcoin via our BTMs and feature-rich mobile app enables not only these users, but also the broader public, to access the digital financial system. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our offerings included approximately 8,304 BTMs in retail locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, our BDCheckout product, which is accepted at approximately 7,723 retail locations, and our mobile app. We maintain a leading position among cash-to-Bitcoin BTM operators in the U.S. and Canada. 
 Kiosk Network and Retailer Relationships 
 Bitcoin Depot operates a network of kiosks that allow users to purchase Bitcoin with cash. Upon using a Bitcoin Depot kiosk for the first time, users will be prompted to provide certain information for account creation and verification. Users are required to select from three ranges of cash amounts to be inserted in the kiosk for purchasing Bitcoin. The user then provides the address of his or her digital wallet by scanning a QR code or manually inputting his or her unique wallet address; the user can create and use a Bitcoin Depot-branded wallet (un-hosted and non-custodial), or his or her own other existing digital wallet. Cash is then inserted by the user into the kiosk, and the kiosk will confirm the dollar amount and other details of the transaction, including quantity of Bitcoin being purchased. Once the transaction is complete, the Bitcoin is electronically delivered to the user s digital wallet and the user is provided with a physical receipt as well as a receipt via SMS text. 
 Bitcoin Depot s largest BTM deployment as of September 30, 2024 is with Circle K, a convenience store chain of over 9,000 stores in North America and over 4,800 stores in Europe and other international markets. We are the exclusive provider and operator of BTMs for Circle K in the U.S. and Canada, and as of September 30, 2024 we have installed our BTMs in approximately 1,200 Circle K stores. We also have kiosks deployed in other convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, and shopping malls. 
 Cryptocurrencies 
 Our revenues, 436.9 and 540.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, have not been correlated to the price of Bitcoin historically, even in light of volatile Bitcoin prices. For example, our revenue during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 declined by 15.2 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, while the market price of Bitcoin increased by 127 during the same period. Based on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our products and services for non-speculative purposes, including money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others. 
 We use a sophisticated Bitcoin management process to reduce our exposure to volatility in Bitcoin prices by maintaining a relatively low balance (typically less than 0.6 million) of Bitcoin at any given time, which we believe differentiates us from our competition. Our typical practice is to purchase Bitcoin through a liquidity provider such as Cumberland DRW or Abra. We replenish our Bitcoin only through purchases from leading Bitcoin liquidity providers and do not engage in any mining of Bitcoin ourselves. Our 
 - 40 -

sophisticated replenishment process enables us to satisfy our users Bitcoin purchases with our own Bitcoin holdings yet maintain relatively small balances of Bitcoin to effectively manage our principal risk related to our operations. There are two main components of the working capital required in our operations. On the Bitcoin side, we maintain Bitcoin in our hot wallets to fulfill orders from users while we are automatically placing orders with liquidity providers and exchanges to replenish the Bitcoin we have sold to users. The second component to working capital is the cash that accumulates in the BTM kiosks. As users insert cash into the BTM kiosks, cash accumulates until armored carriers collect the cash and process it back to our bank accounts. We typically maintain a variable level of cash in the BTM kiosks at all times. Cash in BTM kiosks as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 24.2 of average monthly revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In June 2024, the Company announced plans to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held approximately 0.7 million of Bitcoin allocated to its treasury strategy.

 We operate internationally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, on October 13, 2023, Governor Newsom signed the California Digital Financial Assets Law and Senate Bill 401, which together will regulate virtual currency activities within the state when the laws become fully effective on July 1, 2025. Some of the

provisions became effective January 1, 2024. These provisions aim to regulate digital financial asset transaction kiosks crypto kiosks by imposing a daily limit of 1,000 on the amount of funds that the operator can accept from, or dispense to a California resident at its crypto kiosks, which has negatively impacted the Company s revenue in California. 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We monitor and evaluate the following key business metrics to measure performance, identify trends, develop and refine growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics and measures are useful to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business, and to facilitate comparisons of our performance to that of our competitors. 
 Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics internationally. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment and we regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance.

(1) BDCheckout was launched in the second quarter of 2022. 

(2) Includes kiosks held with our logistics providers, the manufacturer, or kiosks that are in-transit to new locations, which we believe will result in higher transaction volume and revenue per kiosk once deployed. 

(3) During the first quarter of 2023, one of our retail partners discontinued all BDCheckout and cryptocurrency transactions in its stores. 

Installed Kiosks 
 This metric provides an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our potential future business opportunities. We define installed kiosks as the number of kiosks installed at the end of the quarter in a retail location that are connected to our network. We monitor transaction volume at our kiosks on a continuous basis to maximize transaction volumes from each kiosk. Based on these monitoring activities, we may re-deploy certain of our kiosks, using third-party logistics providers, to new locations (e.g., those available with our new retail partners) that we believe will maximize transaction volumes and revenues. 
 Returning User Transaction Count 
 This metric provides an indicator of user retention and our competitive advantage relative to our peers, as well as the trajectory of cryptocurrency adoption, and allows us to make strategic decisions. We define returning user transaction count as the average number of aggregate transactions completed at any kiosk in the four quarters trailing the quarter in which a given user s first transaction occurred, measured only for users who complete more than one transaction. For example, as of September 30, 2024, users who first transacted at one of our kiosks during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and who subsequently completed a second transaction completed an average of 7.3 transactions over the twelve months following their initial transaction. 
 Median Kiosk Transaction Size 
 This metric provides information to analyze user behavior as well as evaluate our performance and formulate financial projections. We calculate median kiosk transaction size based on the dollar value of all purchases and sales of Bitcoin at our kiosks, including transaction fees, during the rolling twelve month period. 
 BDCheckout Locations 
 This metric provides an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our potential future business opportunities. We calculate BDCheckout locations as the number of locations where BDCheckout is available at the end of the quarter. We are currently in discussion with other retail partners to expand our BDCheckout offering into additional locations.

Segment Reporting 
 Our financial reporting is organized into one segment. We make specific disclosures concerning our products and services because such disclosure facilitates our discussion of trends and operational initiatives within our business and industry. Our products and services are aggregated and viewed by management as one reportable segment due to the similarity in the nature of the customers and overall economic characteristics, the nature of the products and services provided and the applicable regulatory environment. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from the cash paid by customers to purchase Bitcoin from our kiosks. For example, approximately 99.9 of our revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was derived from the sale of our cryptocurrency, including the markup at which we sell cryptocurrency to users (which can vary between BDCheckout and BTM kiosks) and a separate flat transaction fee. These user-initiated transactions are governed by terms and conditions agreed to at the time of each point-of-sale transaction and do not extend beyond the transaction. 
 For the periods presented, the markup percentage for BTM kiosk transactions ranged between 15 and 42 , of the USD amount of the transaction with such markup rates historically having been, and continuing to be, subject to fluctuation as a result of our ongoing price strategy testing. The markup percentage for BDCheckout transactions has been 15 since the rollout of this type of transaction in 2022. Finally, the Company receives a commission as a percentage for our website transactions which was 12.0 through September 30, 2024. Markup percentages are determined by examining user transaction patterns in various geographic locations, based on ongoing markup rate testing, with the ultimate aim of optimizing profitability, growth and user base. 
 For each Bitcoin transaction on our kiosks and within BDCheckout, the cryptocurrency price displayed to users includes the exchange rate at which we sell Bitcoin to users as well as a separate flat transaction fee. As of September 30, 2024, we charge (i) a flat 3.00 fee on all transactions at BTM kiosks, which generally corresponds to the costs underlying such transactions and (ii) a flat 3.50 fee on BDCheckout transactions, which is what InComm charges us to facilitate transactions using InComm s network. 
 We support the sale of Bitcoin by users at only 34 kiosks, or less than 1.0 of our total kiosks as of September 30, 2024, and currently do not have plans to expand the ability of our users to sell Bitcoin to us in exchange for cash. We charge the same fees on Bitcoin we purchase from users via our kiosks as we do for Bitcoin we sell to users at our kiosks. 
 Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 Our cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization), which is primarily driven by transaction volume, consists primarily of direct costs related to selling Bitcoin and operating our network of kiosks. Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of Bitcoin, fees paid to obtain Bitcoin, impairment of cryptocurrencies, gains on sales of Bitcoin on an exchange, fees paid to operate the software on the BTMs, rent paid for floorspace for BTMs, fees paid to transfer Bitcoin to users, cost of BTM repair and maintenance, and the cost of armored trucks to collect and transport cash deposited into the BTMs. 
 
 Our costs associated with a BDCheckout transaction are lower than costs associated with a BTM transaction, primarily due to significantly greater operating expenses associated with the BTMs, including cash collection fees and short-term lease payments to the retail locations where the kiosks are placed. However, the profitability of the two services is similar because of the higher markup that Bitcoin Depot applies to BTM transactions to support the higher costs associated therewith. 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our customer support, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, operations, human resources, and administrative personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services. 
 Depreciation and amortization include depreciation on computer hardware and software, BTMs (including both BTMs owned by us and those subject to finance leases), office furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets. 

Other income (expense)

Table of Contents 

Other income (expense) includes interest expense, the impact of lease modifications, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. 
 Interest expense consists primarily of the interest expense on our borrowings and our finance leases and loss on extinguishment of debt.

Revenue 
 Revenue decreased by 44.2 million, or 24.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in kiosk transaction revenue which was related to decreases in the number of transactions offset slightly by higher average transaction sizes. Additionally, regulatory changes limiting the transaction size in California resulted in lower kiosk revenue in California. In the last quarter of 2023, we uninstalled approximately 1,000 BTMs, which were subsequently reinstalled during the later part of February and March 2024 during our kiosk optimization plan, leading to lower revenue compared to the prior period. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company activated approximately 1,000 additional kiosks. Revenue was impacted by the significant number of kiosk reinstallations in the second quarter of 2024 due to the Kiosk optimization plan described above. Typically, the Company experiences customer adoption and growth in revenue in future periods from a kiosk relocation.

Cost of Cryptocurrency includes impairment losses recognized on cryptocurrencies net of any gains recognized from sales of cryptocurrencies on an exchange. Impairment of 2.4 million and 1.8 million were recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We did not have any gains from the sale of cryptocurrency during the quarter. 
 Cost of Cryptocurrency BTM Kiosks 
 Our cost of cryptocurrency decreased by 41.1 million, or 29.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of lower transaction volume in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Floorspace Leases 
 Our floorspace lease expenses increased by 1.4 million, or 17.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was related to the increase in installed kiosks and the total overall rent paid to store owners and distributors under floorspace leases as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Kiosk Operations 
 Our kiosk operations costs increased by 0.1 million or 1.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our kiosk operations consisted of armored cash collection, bank fees, software costs, insurance and repair and maintenance. These costs were higher during the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to installment costs as a result of activating additional kiosks. 
 Operating expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.5 million, or 9.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by lower professional fees, as a result of going public expenses incurred in 2023, that did not recur in 2024. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, these costs were partially offset by increases due to higher payroll costs due to headcount increasing from 115 at September 30, 2023 to 130 at September 30, 2024 to support our operations. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by 1.0 million or 31.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to the change in useful life of assets, 0.8 million, and leases maturing, 0.5 million, offset by 0.3 million due to new kiosks. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other expenses decreased by approximately 3.3 million or 53.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 2.7 million expenses associated with the PIPE Financing for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which did not reoccur in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Kiosk Transaction 
 Our kiosk transaction revenue decreased by 103.7 million, or 19.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in kiosk transaction revenue primarily related to a decreased number of users and transaction volume as a result of relocating kiosks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that did not not occur in the same magnitude in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Also impacting our revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are the daily transaction limits set in California, which accounted for approximately 20 of the decrease in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, revenue was impacted by the significant number of new kiosk installations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had approximately 16 more kiosks on average in service as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Our cost of cryptocurrency decreased by 91.6 million, or 21.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of lower transaction volume in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period.

 Software Processing Fees 
 Our software processing fees decreased by 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in software processing fees was a direct result of completing the migration of our BTMs to the BitAccess platform in the first quarter of 2023, which reduced the costs we incurred from a third-party service provider for software processing fees based on kiosk transaction volume. 
 Mining Fees 
 Our mining fees increased by 0.3 million, or 160.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher blockchain network fees due to additional traffic on the blockchain.

Operating expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.8 million, or 1.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs increased primarily due to higher payroll costs due to headcount increasing from 115 at September 30, 2023 to 130 at September 30, 2024 to support our operations. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other expenses decreased by approximately 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the recognition of PIPE expenses in the three and nine ended September 30, 2023, which did not recur in 2024. Interest expense increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of an increase to the amount of principal under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The increase of debt principal balance was considered an extinguishment of our prior debt agreement under US GAAP. This change resulted in the write-off of prior capitalized debt issuance costs of 2.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which did not occur in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to Legacy Bitcoin Depot unit holders 
 Prior to the close of the Merger, net income was allocated to the Legacy Bitcoin Depot unit holders. After the close of the Merger on June 30, 2023, the Legacy Bitcoin Depot unit holders no longer receive any income allocation as they are owners of BT HoldCo. 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 
 Prior to the close of the Merger, the non-controlling interest reflected Bitcoin Depot s ownership in BitAccess. Subsequent to the close of the Merger, the non-controlling interest reflect both Bitcoin Depot's ownership in BitAccess and BT HoldCo. After the close of the Merger, up to 29.0 million of the net income from BT OpCo will be allocated to BT HoldCo as a result of the preferred return to BT Assets related to their preferred interest in BT HoldCo. If net income exceeds 29.0 million, such excess income will be allocated to Bitcoin Depot and BT HoldCo based on their pro rata economic ownership interest in BT OpCo. Additionally, when losses are incurred, BT HoldCo allocates the losses based on the economic ownership. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net Loss of BT OpCo was allocated to BT HoldCo and Bitcoin Depot Inc utilizing the HLBV methodology. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net Loss was allocated to Bitcoin Depot Inc from BT HoldCo.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On September 30, 2024, we had negative working capital of approximately (4.3) million, which included cash and cash equivalents and other current assets of approximately 41.4 million, offset by accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately 45.6 million. We reported net income of approximately 2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On December 31, 2023, we had negative working capital of approximately (8.8) million, which included cash and cash equivalents and other current assets of approximately 37.3 million, offset by accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately 46.0 million. We reported net income of approximately 1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 For each of the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, approximately 99.9 of our total transaction volume was attributable to transactions in Bitcoin and, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, transactions in Bitcoin account for 100 of our transaction volumes. We purchase Bitcoin through liquidity providers on a just-in-time basis based on expected transaction volumes in order to maintain a balance at a specified amount. Our ability to dynamically rebalance the levels of Bitcoin we hold at any given time based on transaction volumes and the market price of Bitcoin means that there are limited working capital requirements related to our Bitcoin management activities. There are two main components of the working capital required in our operations. We maintain Bitcoin (currently in an amount which, at any given time, is typically less than 0.6 million) in our hot wallets to fulfill orders from users while we are automatically placing orders with liquidity providers and exchanges to replenish the Bitcoin we have sold to users. The second component of working capital is cash and cash equivalents generated from sales at our BTM kiosks. As users insert cash into the BTM kiosks, cash accumulates until armored carriers collect the cash and process it back to our bank accounts. While not required, we typically maintain a variable level of cash in the BTM kiosks at all times. As of September 
 - 50 - 

Table of Contents 

30, 2024, cash in the BTM kiosks was approximately 24.2 of average monthly revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts and the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to purchase additional kiosks and invest in the expansion of our products and services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. 
 Share repurchase program 
 On September 22, 2023, the Company announced that its Board has authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 10.0 million of outstanding shares of its Class A common stock beginning immediately and continuing through and including September 30, 2024. The Company made an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of purchases or sales of securities, including purchases of its own shares as part of the share repurchase program, as of the trade date. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 69,976 shares at a total cost of 0.2 million with an average cost per share of 2.26. No shares were repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024. From the date of authorization through September 30, 2024, 190,620 shares of the Company's Class A common stock had been repurchased with a total cost of 0.4 million. The program was not renewed upon expiration. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Gross Profit 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measurement used internally by management to measure the efficiency of our business. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion. You should review the reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income before interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, PIPE related expenses, share-based compensation, and miscellaneous cost adjustments. 
 These items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measurement used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. The presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion. You should review the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

 Commitments and Contingencies 
 We assess legal contingencies in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies and determines whether a legal contingency is probable, reasonably possible or remote. When contingencies become probable and can be reasonably estimated, we record an estimate of the probable loss. When contingencies are considered probable or reasonably possible but cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the contingency when the probable or reasonably possible loss could be material. 
 Litigation 
 From time to time in the regular course of our business, we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters. Except as noted below, there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by us to be contemplated to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject to. 
 
 We believe that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable. These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. We do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

The Company is still assessing the impacts to its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08 " Intangibles Goodwill and Other Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets ". ASU 2023-08 will require entities to measure crypto assets that meet the scope criteria at fair value and to reflect changes in fair value in net income each reporting period. The amendments in ASU 2023-08 will also require entities to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value measurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets on the income statement. The amendments in the ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is still assessing the impacts to its consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 3. 	 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The exposure to these risks is managed through normal operating and financing activities. 
 Item 4. 	 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 With the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, solely as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting below. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 In connection with the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses had not been remediated as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified related to (i) the fact that the Company did not have formalized system of internal control over financial reporting in place to ensure that risks are properly assessed, controls are properly designed and implemented and internal controls are properly monitored and functioning, (ii) the Company s reliance on IT systems and the use of service organizations to initiate, process, and record transactions, for which it did not evaluate or test the respective control objectives and data provided by the service organizations, and did not maintain a sufficient complement of formally documented general IT controls over access, segregation of duties, security, and change management, (iii) the Company s lack of technical accounting resources to analyze and apply technical accounting considerations, (iv) the Company having insufficient controls in place to prevent potential unauthorized activity related to cryptocurrencies, and (v) ineffective reconciliation controls over cash in transit. Management has concluded that these material weaknesses arose because, as a private company (prior to the closing of the Merger), the Company did not have the necessary business processes, personnel and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company. 
 Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud, and material weaknesses could limit the ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements. To address the material weaknesses, the Company will need to add personnel as well as implement additional financial reporting processes and related internal controls. Management intends to continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above through hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel, further enhancing their accounting processes and risk assessment, and by designing, implementing and monitoring the respective controls. Management will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and the controls have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects or that the actions that management may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or detect potential future material weaknesses. The Company s current controls and any new controls that management develops may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in the business and weaknesses in disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm the operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet the reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of the Company s financial statements for prior periods. 
 Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting required to be included in Bitcoin Depot s periodic reports that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in Bitcoin Depot s reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of the Class A common stock. In addition, we would not be able to continue to be listed on Nasdaq, which could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of your investment. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 	 Legal Proceedings 
 On January 13, 2023, Canaccord Genuity Corp. Canaccord commenced proceedings against the Company by filing a claim with the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto, Ontario which named Lux Vending, LLC and Bitcoin Depot LLC as the defendants. Canaccord is a financial services firm in Canada that the Company previously had hired to perform advisory services related to a potential initial public offering or sales transaction. The claim asserts that Lux Vending, LLC breached the contract by terminating the contract to avoid paying fees for their services and that Canaccord is entitled to approximately 22.3 million in damages equivalent to the fees alleged to be payable for breach of contract that would have been owed upon the closing of a transaction to acquire control, the sale of substantially all the Company s assets, or a merger transaction pursuant to the previously terminated engagement letter for advisory services. Canaccord proposes that the amount of fees would be calculated on the total transaction value of the business combination that Canaccord now values at 655 million. The claim also seeks an award for legal and other costs relating to the proceeding. On October 25, 2023, Canaccord amended their complaint to increase the amount of the claim by 0.7 million to roughly 23 million and to add Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC as a defendant to account for the name change following the closing of the merger. The increase in the claim is the result of Canaccord changing the estimated transaction value from 615 to 655 million. 
 Bitcoin Depot does not believe the allegations made against it are valid and intends to vigorously defend against them. The range of potential loss related to the identified claim is between 0 and 23.0 million, the amount of damages that Canaccord is seeking in the lawsuit. The additional costs mentioned in the claim are not able to be estimated at this time. The discovery phase of the litigation involving documentary productions and oral examinations is largely completed. A mediation of the dispute will be held at the end of fourth quarter of 2024. 
 We are also party to various other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business. We believe these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 Item 1A. 	Risk Factors 
 For a complete discussion of the Company s risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 If the following risk occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the market price of our class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 Further reductions in mining rewards of Bitcoin, including due to block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific period of time (the most recent of which occurred on April 19, 2024) that reduce the block reward earned by miners who validate Bitcoin transactions, or increases in the costs associated with Bitcoin mining, including increases in electricity costs and hardware and software used in mining, or new or enhanced regulation or taxation of Bitcoin mining, which could further increase the costs associated with Bitcoin mining, any of which may cause a decline in support for the Bitcoin network.
