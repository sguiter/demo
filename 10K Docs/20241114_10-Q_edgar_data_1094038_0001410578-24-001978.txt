The following should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Company Overview We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company specializing in the development and commercialization of novel T cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumor indications. Harnessing millions of years of immunologic evolution, Marker s multi tumor associated antigen multiTAA )-specific T cell technology is designed to recognize and kill highly heterogeneous tumors without the need for genetic modifications. This approach selectively expands natural tumor-specific T cells from a patient s/donor s blood that are capable of recognizing a broad range of tumor associated antigens, or TAAs. Unlike other T cell therapies, multiTAA-specific T cells are able to recognize hundreds of different epitopes within up to six tumor-specific antigens to produce broad spectrum anti-tumor activity. Targeting multiple antigens simultaneously exploits the natural capacity of T cells to recognize and kill tumor targets via native T cell receptors TCR ), while limiting tumor adaptation/escape by antigen-negative selection or antigen down-regulation. When infused into a patient with cancer, the multiTAA-specific T cells are designed to kill cancer cells expressing the TAA and potentially recruit the patient s immune system to participate in the cancer killing process. We licensed the underlying technology for multiTAA-specific T cell therapy from Baylor College of Medicine, or BCM, in March 2018. BCM had utilized the therapy in seven exploratory clinical trials. In these studies, BCM treated over 150 patients suffering from a variety of cancers including lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and various sarcomas. In those studies, BCM saw evidence of clinical benefit, expansion of infused cells, and decreased toxicity compared to other cellular therapies. We are advancing two product candidates for 3 clinical indications as part of our multiTAA-specific T cell program for: Autologous multiTAA product for the treatment of lymphoma and pancreatic cancer (MT-601) Off-the-Shelf (OTS) product in various indications (e.g., MT-401-OTS)

 We do not genetically engineer our multiTAA-specific T cell therapies and we believe that our product candidates are superior to T cells engineered with chimeric antigen receptors, or CAR-T, for several reasons including: Multiple targets enhanced tumoricidal effect minimized tumor immune escape Clinical safety no treatment-related side effects, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or other severe adverse effects (SAEs), were attributed to the use of multiTAA-specific T cell therapies to date Non-genetically engineered T cell products selective expansion of tumor-specific T cells from a patient s or donor s blood capable of recognizing a broad range of tumor antigens no risk of mutagenesis and reduced manufacturing complexity lower cost 
 For these reasons, we believe our endogenous T cell receptor-based therapies may provide meaningful clinical benefit and safety to patients with both hematological and solid tumors. We believe that the simplicity of our manufacturing process allows additional modifications to expand multiTAA-specific T cell recognition of cancer targets. For example, we are assessing the potential of combining multiTAA-specific T cell products with other products. On April 8, 2024, we issued a press release announcing that Geoffrey Shouse, D.O., Ph.D., the Principal Investigator at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, CA, was invited to present his clinical experience from the APOLLO study at the 11th Global Summit on Hematologic Malignancies in Whistler, BC, Canada (April 2-7, 2024). Dr. Shouse provided an overview on the clinical observations obtained at City of Hope on Saturday, April 6, 2024, and reported that study participants tolerated initial dose level well and demonstrated durable objective responses after MT-601 treatment.

Net Loss from continuing operations The decrease in our net loss from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to cost reductions in our general and administrative expenses, and higher grant income. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the future as we continue to invest in research and development activities, including clinical development of our multiTAA T cell product candidates. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have not generated any revenues from the sales or licensing of our product candidates since inception and only have limited revenue associated with grants to fund research. We have financed our operations primarily through public and private offerings of our stock and debt including warrants and the exercise thereof, grants, and more recently through the cash proceeds received from the Cell Ready transaction and additional grants to fund research. Based on our clinical and research and development plans and our timing expectations related to the progress of our programs, we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, including drawdowns of available grant funds, will enable us to

Table of Contents 
 fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into October 2025. This estimate is subject to our ability to effectively manage our costs, raise additional capital, and utilize drawdowns of anticipated grant funds. Cash and Working Capital The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and working capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 9,000,000 15,111,000 Working capital 7,450,000 14,053,000 Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Continuing operations: Net cash used in operating activities (6,207,000) (8,036,000) Net cash provided by financing activities 95,000 1,100,000 Discontinued operations Net cash used in operating activities (6,036,000) Net cash provided by investing activities 18,664,000 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (6,112,000) 5,692,000 Continuing Operations Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.2 million. The use of cash primarily related to our net loss from continuing operations of 6.9 million offset by a 0.5 million increase from changes in assets and liabilities and a 0.2 million increase from stock-based compensation. Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.0 million. The changes in cash flow from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were due to 11.3 million of net losses from continuing operations, offset by a 2.6 million increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities and a 0.7 million increase from stock-based compensation. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million and 1.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the net proceeds from sale of common stock as well as the exercise of stock options. Discontinued Operations Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.0 million, which primarily related to our gain from discontinued operations of 5.9 million and stock-based compensation expense in discontinued operations of 0.7 million, offset by 12.6 million of changes in assets and liabilities in discontinued operations.

Table of Contents 
 Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 18.7 million, which related to the sale of assets in discontinued operations. Future Capital Requirements To date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of approved drug products, and we do not expect to generate substantial revenue for at least the next several years. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenue will be compromised. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our product candidates, and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts. In August 2021, the Company received notice of a Product Development Research award totaling approximately 13.1 million from the CPRIT to support the Company s clinical investigation of MT-401. Through the date of this filing, the Company has received 9.7 million of funds from the CPRIT grant. The Company recorded 0.9 million and 2.4 million of grant income related to the CPRIT grant as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.1 million of grant income receivable. On September 13, 2022, the Company received notice from the FDA that it had awarded the Company a 2.0 million grant from the FDA s Orphan Products Grant program to support the clinical investigation of MT-401 for the treatment of post-transplant AML. Through the date of this filing, the Company has received 1.0 million from the FDA grant. The Company recorded 0.02 million and 0.5 million of grant income related to the FDA grant as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.02 million of grant income receivable. In May 2023, the Company announced that it had received a 2.0 million grant from the National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research SBIR program to support the development and investigation of MT-401 for the treatment of AML patients following standard-of-care therapy with hypomethylating agents. Through the date of this filing, the Company has received 0.9 million from SBIR. The Company recorded 0.3 million and 0.7 million of grant income related to the SBIR grant as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.3 million of grant income receivable. The above funding agencies have agreed to continue their financial support and to shift funds to the MT-401-OTS program. In June 2024, the Company received notice of a 2.0 million grant over a 2-year period from the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute to support control over tumor immune escape in pancreatic cancer using a dual T cell product strategy. Through the date of this filing, the Company has received immaterial funds from this grant. In August 2024, the Company received notice of a 2.0 million grant from the National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research Program to support the clinical investigation of MT-601 in patients with non-Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL) who have relapsed following anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Through the date of this filing, the Company has received 0.7 million of funds from this grant. The Company recorded 0.7 million of grant income related to this grant as revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.3 million of grant income receivable. In August 2024, the Company received another 2.0 million grant from the National Institutes of Health SBIR Program to support the advancement of MT-601 in patients with pancreatic cancer. Through the date of this filing, the Company has not received any funds from this grant. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 7.4 million, compared to working capital of 14.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Operating expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.3 million and 11.6 million,

 respectively, compared to 3.5 million and 13.9 million during the equivalent prior year periods. Based on our clinical plans and our timing expectations related to the progress of our programs, we anticipate that, together with drawdowns of available grant funds, our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into October 2025. This estimate is subject to our ability to effectively manage our costs, raise additional capital, and utilize drawdowns of anticipated grant funds. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Furthermore, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned in order to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we may enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, as we: initiate or continue clinical trials of our product candidates; continue the research and development of our product candidates and seek to discover additional product candidates; seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates if they successfully complete clinical trials; continue development of our manufacturing capabilities and our manufacturing facility; establish sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any product candidates that may receive regulatory approval; evaluate strategic transactions we may undertake; and enhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates and, if a product candidate is approved, our commercialization efforts. 
 Because all of our product candidates are in the early stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings and collaboration arrangements. We plan to continue to fund our operations and capital funding needs through equity and/or debt financing. We may also consider new collaborations or selectively partner our technology. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders common stock. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us. We may also be required to pay damages or have liabilities associated with litigation or other legal proceedings involving our company. In addition to the foregoing, high inflation and concerns about an economic recession in the United States or other major markets have resulted in, among other things, volatility in the capital markets that may have the effect of reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction due to these factors could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. ATM Agreement In August 2021, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or the Sales Agents, pursuant to which we can offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion through the Sales Agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0 million. Any shares of our common stock sold will be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-258687), which the SEC 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 declared effective on August 19, 2021. However, our use of the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited for so long as we are subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, which limits the amounts that we may sell under the registration statement and in accordance with the ATM agreement. The Sales Agents will be entitled to compensation under the Sales Agreement at a commission rate equal to 3.0 of the gross sales price per share sold under the ATM Agreement, and we have provided each of the Sales Agents with indemnification and contribution rights. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 8,178 shares of its common stock under the ATM Agreement resulting in net proceeds of approximately 37,000, after deducting agent commissions. On June 10, 2024, the Company provided notice of its termination of the ATM Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC. The Company is not subject to any termination penalties related to the termination of the ATM Agreement. The Company is currently considering more effective ways to improve market access to its equity. Stock Purchase Agreement On December 12, 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or Lincoln Park, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park up to 25,000,000 of shares of our common stock, or the Purchase Shares, from time to time over a 24-month term, at a variable price with certain market-based terms as defined in the agreement. The purchase agreement does not exhibit any of the characteristics for liability classification under ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In January 2023, Lincoln Park was issued 180,410 shares of stock as a commitment fee at a value of 0.5 million. On February 29, 2024, we terminated the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park effective March 1, 2024. Going Concern We have no sources of revenue, other than grant and related party services income, to provide incoming cash flows to sustain our future operations. As outlined above, our ability to pursue our long-term planned business activities is dependent upon our successful efforts to raise additional capital. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that we will continue to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Critical Accounting Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses in the periods presented. The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates include the valuation and attribution of stock-based compensation and grant income. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted (including modification of options) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with key assumptions including volatility, computed using the Company s historical stock price over its expected terms. With respect to grant income, the Company recognizes revenue when qualifying costs are incurred for the amount the Company is entitled to under the provisions of the contract. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described under Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
