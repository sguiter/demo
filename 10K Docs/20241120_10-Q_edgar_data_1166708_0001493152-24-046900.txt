NOTE
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

This
Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. Words such as, but not limited to, believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, 
 intend, plan, targets, likely, aim, will, would, 
 could, and similar expressions or phrases identify forward- looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements
largely on our current expectations and future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results
of operation, business strategy and financial needs. 

You
should read thoroughly this Quarterly Report with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what
we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on May 9, 2024, which risk factors could adversely impact our business and financial
performance. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can
we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist
after the date on which they are made, except as required by applicable law.

The Company elected the accounting policy to include both the lease and non-lease components of
its agreements as a single component and account for them as a lease. 

Operating
lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings
available to the Company. Operating lease right-of-use ROU assets are recognized based on the initial present value of
the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases. Operating lease ROU assets
are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets used in operations. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost
and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. 

When
the Company has the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease for the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased
asset, and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option, it considers these options in determining the classification
and measurement of the lease. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses
over the term of the lease. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, cash paid for operating lease liabilities was and ,
respectively.

. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of . Despite a working capital surplus of approximately
 , at September 30, 2024, the continued losses and cash used in operations raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability
to increase revenues, control expenses, raise capital and sustain adequate working capital to finance its operations. The failure to
achieve the necessary levels of profitability and cash flows would be detrimental to the Company. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Results
of Operations 

Net
Revenues, Costs of Net Revenues and Gross Profit 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
revenues increased 8.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result
of an increase in revenues in BLU3, SSI, and LWA. Net revenue for BLU3 SSI, and LWA increased 25.1 , 42.8 , and 12.5 , respectively.
The increase in BLU3 s revenue is due to the recovery from the recall that directly affected the previous period s revenues.
SSI s increase can be attributed to the continued momentum of the Company s newest product, HEED3 as well as increased demand
from international users of SSI s Spare Air product line. The increase in BLU3, SSI and LWA revenue was offset by decreased
revenues in BTL, and LBI. Net revenue for BTL, and LBI decreased 13.9 , and 50.9 , respectively, as a result of a loss of sales momentum
as well as a soft demand in many areas of BTL, and LBI s markets. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of net revenues was 55.3 as compared with the cost of net revenues of 67.7 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The cost decrease as a percentage of revenue, can be directly attributed to the cost of direct
labor, which accounted for a larger portion of costs and significantly impacted the profit margin. Included in cost of net revenues are
royalty expenses paid to Robert Carmichael which increased 1.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross
profit margin was 44.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to gross profit margin of 32.3 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross margin, is directly attributable to an increase in SSI s margin to 63.0 primarily
attributed to SSI s newest product, HEED3, and reduced manufacturing labor positively impacting gross margin. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
revenues increased 4.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result
of an increase in revenues in BLU3 and SSI. Net revenue for BLU3 and SSI increased 29.0 and 39.0 , respectively. The increase in BLU3 s
revenue is due to the recovery from the recall that directly affected the previous period s revenues. SSI s increase can
be attributed to the continued momentum of the Company s newest product, HEED3, and increased demand from international users of
SSI s Spare Air product line. The increase in BLU3 and SSI revenue was offset by decreased revenues in BTL, LWA, and LBI.
Net revenue for BTL, LWA, and LBI decreased 19.6 , 9.3 , and 47.3 , respectively, as a result of a loss of sales momentum as well as
a soft demand in many areas of BTL, LWA, and LBI s markets. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of net revenues was 59.5 as compared with the cost of net revenues of 70.4 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The cost decrease as a percentage of revenue, can be directly attributed to the cost of direct labor,
which accounted for a smaller portion of costs and significantly impacted the profit margin. Included in cost of net revenues are royalty
expenses paid to Robert Carmichael which decreased 8.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months
ended June 30, 2023. 

Gross
profit margin was 40.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to gross profit margin of 29.6 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross margin is directly attributable to increased margins for SSI, LWA and LBI primarily attributed
to SSI s newest product, HEED3, and reduced manufacturing labor positively impacting gross margin.

Stock Compensation expenses decreased by 100.0 and 51.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of vesting milestones based upon performance goals not

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase can be attributed

Advertising
expense decreased 35.6 and 18.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. This decrease is attributable to BLU3 s decrease in advertising online expenses. BLU3 s
decrease in advertising expenses was offset slightly by an increase in trade show expenses. 

Other
expenses increased 86.9 and 52.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due primarily to an increase in rent expenses.

expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 99.5 and 5.4 , compared to the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of a decrease in new product development activity. 

Other
Income/Expense

Going
Concern 

Our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period
following the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The report of our independent registered public accounting
firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes an explanatory paragraph stating
the Company has net losses and an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
If the Company is unable to raise additional funds when needed, or does not have sufficient cash flows from sales, it may be required
to scale back, delay or cease operations, liquidate assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. 

We
have a history of losses, and an accumulated deficit of 17,767,548 as of September 30, 2024. Despite a working capital surplus of 424,805
at September 30, 2024, the continued losses and cash used in operations raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability
to continue to increase revenues, control expenses, raise capital, and continue to sustain adequate working capital to finance its operations.
The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability and cash flows would be detrimental to the Company. We are continuing to
engage in discussions with potential sources for additional capital, however, our ability to raise capital is somewhat limited based
upon our revenue levels, net losses and limited market for our common stock. If we fail to raise additional funds when needed, or if
we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations, we may be required to scale back or cease certain of our operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition, valuation
of inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, and equity-based transactions. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve
the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 2 to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report. 

27 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

There
were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to have a material effect on the Company s
operations, financial position or cash flows. 

These
recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly
Report. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company and is not required to provide this information. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under Exchange Act. In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures
are met. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Based on their evaluations as of September 30, 2024, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in
our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that
a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

28 

Our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30,
2024 and based upon the such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date
due to the material weaknesses set forth below. 

Insufficient
 number and lack of qualified accounting department and administrative personnel and support; 

Insufficient
 written policies and procedures to ensure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to GAAP and
 SEC disclosure requirements; 

Insufficient
 segregation of duties, oversight of work performed and lack of controls in our finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel; 

Company s
 systems that impact financial information and disclosures have ineffective information technology controls; 

Inadequate
 controls surrounding revenue recognition, to ensure that all material transactions and developments impacting the financial statements
 are reflected and properly recorded; and 

Evaluation
 of disclosure controls and procedures was not sufficiently comprehensive due to limited personnel. 

Subject
to sufficient resources, management expects to remediate the material weaknesses identified above as follows: 

Management
 has leveraged and will continue to leverage experienced consultants to assist with ongoing GAAP and SEC compliance requirements.
 We intend to expand our finance department through the hiring of a certified public accountant to strengthen the segregation of duties,
 internal controls and enhance our current staff. 

Segregation
 of duties is being analyzed and adjusted Company-wide, where possible. The Company intends to hire additional personnel in the accounting
 department, as well as the documentation of controls and procedures. 

The
 Company plans on evaluating various accounting systems to enhance its system controls. 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are
committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. We do not,
however, expect that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls will be remediated until such time as we have added to our accounting
and administrative staff allowing improved internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
