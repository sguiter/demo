 How We Generate Revenues 
 Travelzoo 
 Revenues from the Travelzoo brand and business are generated primarily from three categories: Advertising, Membership Fees, and Other. 
 The "Advertising" category consists primarily of (a) advertising fees paid by travel companies for the publishing of their offers on Travelzoo s media properties, (b) commission generated from the sale of Getaways vouchers and bookings on our hotel platform, and (c) publishing fees from high-quality local businesses, sale of Local Deals vouchers and entertainment offers. Advertising fees may be based on audience reach, placement in email newsletters or on media properties, number of listings, number of clicks, and/or actual sales. We typically recognize advertising revenues upon delivery of emails or clicks, as tracked by our internal platform or third-party platforms, in the period of the applicable insertion orders, which are typically for periods between one month and twelve months and are not automatically renewed. For Getaways vouchers, we recognize a percentage of the face value of vouchers upon sale as commission, net of an allowance for future refunds. Merchant agreements for Getaways advertisers are typically for periods between twelve and twenty-four months and are not automatically renewed. Revenues generated from local business offers are based upon a percentage of the face value of the vouchers sold, commission on actual sales or a listing fee based on audience reach. We recognize revenue upon the sale of vouchers, upon notification of the amount of direct bookings or upon delivery of emails. For Local Deals vouchers, we recognize a percentage of the face value of vouchers upon the sale of the vouchers, net of an allowance for refunds. Insertion orders and merchant agreements for Local Deals are typically for periods between one and twelve months and are not automatically renewed. 
 In the second quarter of 2020, due to the global pandemic and various stay-at-home protocols, the Company expanded its voucher refund policy to fully refundable until the voucher expires or is redeemed by the customer. This refund policy was reverted in April 2022 to a 14-day refund period from date of purchase, with a newly introduced option to extend refund eligibility until voucher redemption or expiration, for a surcharge. The expiration dates of vouchers range between October 2024 through December 2025; provided, that these expiration dates may sometimes be extended on a case-by-case basis and final payment to merchants upon expiration may not be due for up to a year later. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 4.3 million and 5.2 million of unredeemed vouchers that had been sold, respectively, representing the Company s commission. The Company estimates a refund reserve using historical and current refund rates by product and by merchant location to calculate estimated future refunds. The Company estimated and recorded a refund reserve of 142,000 and 268,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for these unredeemed vouchers which is recorded as a reduction of revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, and accrued expense and other on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 27 

Merchant payables of 17.3 million as of September 30, 2024 related to unredeemed vouchers is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, representing amounts payable to merchants by the Company for vouchers sold but not redeemed. Certain merchant contracts, typically in foreign locations, allow the Company to retain the proceeds from unredeemed vouchers upon expiration. With these contracts, the Company estimates the value of vouchers that will ultimately not be redeemed and records the estimate as revenues in the same period. 
 The "Membership Fees" category consists of subscription fees paid by Travelzoo, Jack's Flight Club, and Travelzoo META members. Travelzoo membership has historically been free, however, on January 1, 2024, Travelzoo introduced an annual membership fee of 40 (or local equivalent) for new members in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Germany, with the 2024 annual fee waived for existing members as of December 31, 2023. Jack s Flight Club subscription options are quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the respective subscription periods. For Travelzoo META, a founding membership was launched in 2022 following a test-and-learn strategy. 
 The "Other" category consists of licensing fees from license agreements, as well as the retail business originally operated by MTE and acquired and maintained by the Company following the acquisition of MTE. 
 
 Trends in Our Business 
 Our ability to generate revenues in the future depends on numerous factors, including those relating to members, advertisers, competitors, the travel industry, the online advertising business, internal factors and external factors. 
 Factors relating to members include their willingness to purchase the deals we advertise, their demand for vouchers as a promotional format, and with the introduction of membership fees for new members in 2024 and existing members in 2025, our ability to enroll new paying members and transition existing members to paid membership, without adversely affecting our membership base and existing advertising revenue streams. 
 Factors relating to advertisers include our ability to sell more advertising to existing and new advertisers, our ability to enhance our audience reach and advertising rates, spending controls by travel intermediaries to focus on improving profitability, and advertiser shifts from one advertising service (e.g. Top 20 to another (e.g. Local Deals and Getaways ). Advertiser shifts between advertising services could result in no incremental revenue or less revenue than in previous periods, depending on amounts purchased, and in particular with Local Deals and Getaways , depending on how many vouchers are purchased by members. 
 Factors relating to competitors include the willingness of certain competitors to grow their business unprofitably. Factors relating to the travel industry include lingering effects of the global pandemic, geopolitical tensions affecting consumer travel to certain regions, and risk of future unforeseeable macro events that impact travel, while factors relating to the online advertising business include shifts in consumer use of different digital media formats such as from desktop to mobile, from mobile web to mobile app, and from email to push notifications and SMS text messaging. 
 Internal factors include risks relating to our ability to continue to service members without interruption, our ability to develop and launch new products members will utilize and advertisers will adopt, and hiring and relying on key employees for the continued maintenance and growth of our business. 
 External factors include the introduction of new methods of advertising, the relative condition of the economy, cybersecurity risks due to increased dependence on digital technologies, and climate change and related legislation, to the extent such legislation impacts the businesses of our advertisers such as airlines and cruise ship operators, which have come under increasing scrutiny for their carbon footprints. 
 Revenues from local business have been and may continue to decline over time due to market conditions driven by competition and declines in consumer demand. In the last several years, we have seen a decline in the number of vouchers sold and a decrease in the average commission rate earned by us from the merchants for vouchers sold. However, during the global pandemic, we saw an increase in demand by consumers for fully refundable travel options, which led to a slight reversal of this trend and an increase in the sale of Getaways hotel vouchers (although demand for restaurants and spas continued to be low). With the ending of the pandemic, the importance of fully refundable travel options has decreased (and we also shifted to offering a surcharge for full refundability), and the trend is therefore returning to pre-pandemic patterns. 
 
 28 

Our ability to continue generating revenues through advertising, commissions and subscriptions depends heavily upon our ability to maintain and grow an attractive audience for our publications. We monitor our membership base to assess our efforts to maintain and grow our audience reach. We obtain additional members and activity on our websites by acquiring traffic from Internet search and social media companies. The costs to grow our audience have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on our financial results and can vary from period to period. With the introduction of membership fees in 2024, we have been adjusting our user acquisition strategies whose timeframes to become effective are uncertain. While we are initially reducing our expenditures on acquiring traffic as we test new strategies for efficacy, in time we plan to increase these expenditures to maintain or grow our membership, audience and the reach of our publications. We continue to see a shift in users accessing our services through mobile devices and social media and, therefore, anticipate continuing to address this growing channel through additional investments in mobile app development. 
 We believe that an important factor for our advertising rates is the reach of our publications, however, we also believe that there are other important factors, such as the engagement of our membership base with our content. We do not know if we will be able to increase the reach of our publications, particularly with the introduction of membership fees in 2024. We do not know if by increasing the reach of our publications, we will also be able to increase engagement and other key metrics of importance to our advertisers. If we are able to increase the reach of our publications, we still may not be able to or want to increase rates given market conditions, including intense competition in our industry. Even if we increase our rates, the increased price may reduce the number of advertisers willing to advertise with us and could, therefore, decrease our revenue. We may need to decrease our rates based on competitive market conditions and the performance of our audience in order to maintain or grow our revenue. 
 We do not know what our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be in future periods. Our cost of revenues may change in relation to volume and terms with third-party partners of the Travelzoo network, the incurrence of merchant processing fees from the sale of vouchers for Local Deals and Getaways and payment of membership fees, changes in refund request trends and provisioning of customer service. We expect fluctuations in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from quarter to quarter. Some of the fluctuations may be significant and may have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 We do not know what our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods. Changes in the average cost per acquisition of new members impacts our advertising expenses and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, and are not readily predictable. With the introduction of membership fees in 2024, we expect the cost of acquiring new paying members to increase significantly, as compared with the cost of acquiring non-paying members prior to 2024. We are early in the development of new strategies to acquire paying members, so our test budgets have not yet fully scaled. However, as we test new strategies and gain more learnings as to acquiring paying members, our expenditures may increase significantly. We hope efficiencies we have gained through our testing will scale as well. In addition, there may be a significant number of members that cancel or we may cancel their memberships for various reasons, which may prompt us to spend more on member acquisition in order to replace lost members. 
 In addition to the type of membership offered, we believe the average cost per acquisition depends mainly on the advertising rates we pay for media buys, the quality of the members we acquire, our ability to manage our member acquisition efforts successfully, the regions we target to acquire new members and the relative costs for that region, and the degree of competition in our industry. All else equal, increased competition may require us to increase advertising for our brand and advertisers deals. 
 Beside member acquisition costs, we may see a unique opportunity for a brand marketing campaign, experience increases in the cost of retaining or sourcing new advertiser clients, or change the number of personnel or compensation structure for the Sales and marketing function, any of which would result in an increase in sales and marketing expenses. We expect fluctuations in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from year to year and from quarter to quarter. Some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations. We expect increased marketing expenses to spur continued growth in revenue in future periods; however, we cannot be assured of this due to the many factors that impact our growth. We expect to adjust the level of such incremental spending dynamically during any given quarter based upon market conditions, as well as our performance in each quarter. 
 We do not know what our product development expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods. We expect to increase investment in our products in connection with building out and refining the value proposition of the Travelzoo membership. There may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations. Product development changes may lead to reductions of revenue based on changes in receptivity of our offerings to our member audience and advertiser clients. We expect our efforts in developing products and services will continue to be a focus in the future, which may lead to increased product development expenses. Increases in expense may result from costs related to third-party technology service providers and software licenses, headcount and the use of professional services.

We do not know what our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods. There may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 We do not know what our income taxes will be in future periods. There may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations. Our income taxes are dependent on numerous factors such as the geographic mix of our taxable income, foreign, federal, state and local tax law and regulations, and changes thereto. Our income taxes are also dependent on the determination of whether valuation allowances for certain tax assets are required or not, any audits of prior years' tax returns that result in adjustments, resolution of uncertain tax positions and different treatments for certain items for tax versus book purposes. We expect fluctuations in our income taxes from year to year and from quarter to quarter, which may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 Due to the adverse effects of the global pandemic, the Company reduced expenditures in many areas, including but not limited to, marketing, technology and human resources. For example, in 2020, the Company ceased operations in Asia Pacific, conducted employee furloughs and restructured its operations significantly. The Company also renegotiated many of its outstanding contractual obligations with vendors and closed some ancillary office locations. We do not currently anticipate that additional cost-cutting measures will be necessary. In the foreseeable future, we anticipate relatively slow growth in fixed costs for our existing business, while investing in new initiatives where we see opportunities to expand our business, in aggregate, in-line with the trend of our revenues. 
 The key elements of our growth strategy include building our trusted travel, entertainment and local brands, refining and building out the value proposition of our membership and consequently increasing the value and engagement of our members, sourcing more exclusive and compelling offers from travel and entertainment partners, and innovating with new experiences and revenue streams. We expect to continue our efforts to grow; however, we may not grow or we may experience slower growth. 
 We believe that we can sell more advertising if the market for online advertising continues to grow and if we can maintain or increase our market share. We believe the market for advertising continues to shift from offline to online. We do not know if we will be able to maintain or increase our market share. We do not know if we will be able to increase the number of our advertisers in the future. We do not know if we will have market acceptance of our new products or whether the market will continue to accept our existing products.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 11.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which 7.5 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign operations. If this cash is distributed to the U.S., we may be subject to additional U.S. taxes in certain circumstances. We also had 675,000 in restricted cash held in the U.S. as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased 4.3 million from 16.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to 12.1 million as of September 30, 2024 primarily due to 16.6 million cash used to repurchase common stock, offset partially by 13.3 million cash provided by operating activities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had merchant payables of 17.3 million related to unredeemed vouchers. In the Company s financial statements presented in this 10-Q report, following U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), we classified all merchant payables as current. When all merchant payables are classified as current, there is negative net working capital (which is defined as current assets minus current liabilities) of 7.0 million . Payables to merchants are generally due upon redemption of vouchers. The vouchers expire between October 2024 through December 2025; however, these expiration dates may sometimes be extended on a case-by-case basis and final payment upon expiration may not be due for up to a year after expiration. Based on current projections of redemption activity, we expect that cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to provide for working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. 
 The following table provides a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:

 Cash paid for income tax, net of refunds received, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.5 million. Cash refunds for income tax, net of payment made, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 228,000. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 129,000 and 104,000, respectively. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was consisted of purchases of property and equipment. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily consisted of the 217,000 purchases of property and equipment, offset partially by 113,000 proceeds from repayment of the Japan loan. 
 Net cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.2 million which primarily consisted of the repurchase of common stock of 16.6 million and taxes paid for net share settlement of 592,000. Net cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 12.1 million which primarily consisted of the repurchase of common stock of 11.8 million and taxes paid for net share settlement of 299,000. 
 Consistent with our growth, we experienced fluctuations in our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, product development expenses and general and administrative expenses, and we anticipate that these increases will continue for the foreseeable future. We believe cash on hand will be sufficient to pay such costs for at least the next twelve months. In addition, we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses, products and technologies, the consummation of any of which would increase our capital requirements. 
 Although we currently believe we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months, unanticipated events and opportunities or a less favorable than expected development of our business with one or more advertising formats may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish credit facilities to raise capital in order to meet our capital requirements. 
 If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, such sale could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. If we issue debt securities or establish a new credit facility, our fixed obligations could increase and we may be required to agree to operating covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot be sure that any such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. 
 If the development of our business is less favorable than expected, we may decide to significantly reduce the size of our operations and marketing expenses in certain markets with the objective of reducing cash outflows. 
 The information set forth unde r Note 4 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 10 Leases to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. Litigation and claims against the Company may result in legal defense costs, settlements or judgments that could have a material impact on our financial condition. 
 We also have contingencies related to net unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of approximately 24.9 million as of September 30, 2024. See Note 5: Income Taxes to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies include income taxes. For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual

Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as updates in the current fiscal year provided in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Based on management s evaluation (with the participation of the Company s Global Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Accounting Officer (CAO), as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CAO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting noted below to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CAO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 However, after giving full consideration to the material weakness, management, including our CEO and CAO, that our condensed consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Material Weakness 
 We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to having sufficient resources for the accounting for certain non-routine, non-recurring, unusual or complex transactions within our financial statement closing and reporting process. Specifically, the Company did not have internal financial staff with sufficient specific expertise to ensure complete and timely financial reporting and disclosures related to technical and complex accounting transactions. 
 Remediation Plan 
 We have made progress towards remediation and continue to implement our remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above. Specifically, we realigned certain of our personnel (including promoting a Chief Accounting Officer and recruiting for additional headcount in Finance), improved reporting processes, and designed and implemented new controls in preparation for the next non-routine, non-recurring, unusual or complex transaction. We will engage sufficient outside subject matter experts and specialists to ensure the complete and timely accounting and financial reporting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions and technical matters, where appropriate. We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated as soon as possible. We will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 As outlined above, we are in the process of taking steps to remediate the material weakness previously reported related to non-routine, non-recurring, unusual or complex transactions. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we made no other changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
