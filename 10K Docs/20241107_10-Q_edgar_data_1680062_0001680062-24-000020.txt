 -class method, which allocates undistributed earnings to common stock and any participating securities according to dividend rights and participation rights on a proportionate basis. Under the -class method, basic net income per share of common stock is computed by dividing the sum of distributed and undistributed earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. ACM Research did not have any participating securities outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 ACM Research has been authorized to issue Class A and Class B common stock since redomesticating in Delaware in November 2016. The classes of common stock are substantially identical in all material respects, except for voting rights. Since ACM Research did not declare cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, the net income per share of common stock attributable to each class is the same under the -class method. As such, the classes of common stock have been presented on a combined basis in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and in the above computation of net income per share of common stock. 
 
 Diluted net income per share of common stock reflects the potential dilution from securities, such as stock options that could share in ACM Research s earnings. Certain potential dilutive securities were excluded from the net income per share calculation because the impact would be anti-dilutive. The number of potentially dilutive shares that were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share in the periods presented where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were and stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Risk Factors in our Annual Report, as well as those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the section titled Item 1A Risk Factors in Part II below. 

ACM Research, Inc., or ACM Research, is a Delaware corporation founded in California in 1998 to supply capital equipment developed for the global semiconductor industry. Since 2005, ACM Research has conducted its business operations principally through its subsidiary ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc., or ACM Shanghai, a limited liability corporation formed by ACM Research in the People s Republic of China, or mainland China, in 2005. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to our company, our, us, we and similar terms refer to ACM Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including ACM Shanghai, collectively. 
 
 Our principal corporate office is located in Fremont, California. We conduct a substantial majority of our product development, manufacturing, support and services in mainland China through ACM Shanghai. We perform, through a subsidiary of ACM Shanghai, additional product development and subsystem production in Korea, and we conduct, through ACM Research, sales and marketing activities focused on sales of ACM Shanghai products in North America, Europe and certain regions in Asia outside mainland China. 
 
 ACM Research is not a mainland China operating company, and we do not conduct our operations in mainland China through the use of a variable interest entity, or VIE, or any other structure designed for the purpose of avoiding mainland China legal restrictions on direct foreign investments in mainland China-based companies. ACM Research has a direct ownership interest in ACM Shanghai as the result of its holding 82.0 of the outstanding shares of ACM Shanghai. Stockholders of ACM Research may never directly own equity interests in ACM Shanghai. We do not believe that our corporate structure or any other matters relating to our business operations require that we obtain any permissions or approvals from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or any other mainland China central government authority in order to continue to list shares of Class A common stock of ACM Research on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. This determination was based on the facts aforementioned and mainland China Company Law, mainland China Securities Law, cybersecurity regulations and other relevant laws, regulations and regulatory requirements in mainland China currently in effect. However, if this determination proves to be incorrect, then it could have a material adverse effect on ACM Research. See Item IA. Risk Factors Risks Related to International Aspects of Our Business If any mainland China central government authority were to determine that existing mainland China laws or regulations require that ACM Shanghai obtain the authority s permission or approval to continue the listing of ACM Research s Class A common stock in the United States or if those existing mainland China laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, were to change to require such permission or approval, or if we inadvertently conclude that permissions or approvals are not required, ACM Shanghai may be unable to obtain the required permission or approval or may only be able to obtain such permission or approval on terms and conditions that impose material new restrictions and limitations on operation of ACM Shanghai, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects and on the trading price of ACM Research Class A common stock, which could decline in value or become worthless in our Annual Report. 
 
 The business of ACM Shanghai is subject to complex laws and regulations in mainland China that can change quickly with little or no advance notice. To date, beyond the COVID-19-related restrictions in 2022, we have not experienced such intervention or influence by mainland China central government authorities or a change in those authorities rules and regulations that have had a material impact on ACM Shanghai or ACM Research. 
 
 In addition, in the ordinary course of business, ACM Shanghai is required to obtain certain operating permits and licenses necessary for it to operate in mainland China, including business licenses, certifications relating to quality management standards, import and export-related qualifications from customs, as well as environmental and construction permits, licenses and approvals relating to construction projects. We believe ACM Shanghai has all such required permits and licenses. However, from time to time mainland China government issues new regulations, which may require additional actions on the part of ACM Shanghai to comply. If ACM Shanghai does not, or is unable to, obtain any such additional permits or licenses, ACM Shanghai may be subjected to restrictions and penalties imposed by the relevant mainland China

 regulatory authorities, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects and on the trading price of ACM Research Class A common stock, which could decline in value or become worthless. 
 The following chart depicts our corporate organization as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 A detailed description of how cash is transferred through our organization is set forth under Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. 
 
 The U.S. Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCA Act, requires that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, determine whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in any non-U.S. jurisdiction. Under current regulations, if ACM Research were to be included on the SEC's "Conclusive list of issuers identified under the HFCA Act" for two consecutive years due to our independent auditor being located in a jurisdiction that does not allow for PCAOB inspections, the SEC would prohibit trading in our securities and this ultimately could cause our securities to be delisted in the U.S., and their value may significantly decline or become worthless. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to International Aspects of Our Business We could be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with legislation and regulations regarding improved access to audit and other information and audit inspections of accounting firms, including registered public accounting firms, such as our prior and current audit firms, operating in mainland China in our Annual Report for more information. 
 
 In addition to the matters discussed above, we are also subject to a number of legal and operational risks associated with our corporate structure, including as the result of a substantial portion of our operations being conducted in mainland China. Consequences of any of those risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations or cause the value of ACM Research Class A common stock to significantly decline in value or become worthless. Please carefully read the information included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report, in particular the risk factors addressing the following issues: 
 If any mainland China central government authority were to determine that existing mainland China laws or regulations require that ACM Shanghai obtain the authority s permission or approval to continue the listing of ACM Research s Class A common stock in the United States or if those existing mainland China laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, were to change to require such permission or approval, or if we inadvertently conclude that permissions or approvals are not required, ACM Shanghai may be unable to obtain the required permission or approval or may only be able to obtain such permission or approval on terms and conditions that impose material new restrictions and limitations on operation of ACM Shanghai, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects and on the trading price of ACM Research Class A common stock, which could decline in value or become worthless.

 Mainland China central government authorities may intervene in, or influence, ACM Shanghai s mainland China-based operations at any time, and those authorities rules and regulations in mainland China can change quickly with little or no advance notice. 
 The mainland China central government may determine to exert additional control over offerings conducted overseas or foreign investment in mainland China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in operations of ACM Shanghai and cause significant declines in the value of ACM Research Class A common stock, or make them worthless. 
 
 Past statements and regulatory actions by mainland China central government authorities with respect to the use of VIEs and to data security and anti-monopoly concerns have not affected our ability to conduct our business operations in mainland China.

Overview 
 
 We supply advanced, innovative capital equipment developed for the global semiconductor industry. Fabricators of advanced integrated circuits, or chips, can use our wet-cleaning and other front-end processing tools in numerous steps to improve product yield, even at increasingly advanced process nodes. We have designed these tools for use in fabricating foundry, logic and memory chips, including dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, and 3D NAND-flash memory chips. We also develop, manufacture and sell a range of advanced packaging tools to wafer assembly and packaging customers. 
 
 Since 2009 we have delivered more than 1,025 tools to our customers, more than 840 of which we re repeat orders or acceptances upon contractual performance obligations having been met and thereby generated revenue to us. The balance of the delivered tools is subject to the customer's acceptance of the tool upon the tool's satisfaction of applicable contractual requirements or subject to the customer's subsequent discretionary commitment to purchase the tool. To date, substantially all of our sales of equipment for semiconductor-manufacturing have been to customers located in Asia, and we anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue from these products will continue to come from customers located in this region for the foreseeable future. We have begun to add to our efforts to further address customers in North America, Western Europe and Southeast Asia, by expanding our direct sales teams and increasing our global marketing activities. 

Recent Developments 
 ACM Shanghai Dividend 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, ACM Research's principal operating subsidiary, ACM Shanghai (SSEC: 688082.SS), paid a cash dividend for an aggregate total of approximately RMB 273.2 million 38.4 million) to the stockholders of ACM Shanghai, including ACM Research, which owns 82.0 of the outstanding shares of ACM Shanghai. ACM Research intends to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 ACM Shanghai Proposed Private Offering 
 
 In January 2024, ACM Research announced ACM Shanghai's intended plan to offer up to 43.6 million of its ordinary shares, subject to market conditions, the approval of ACM Shanghai s stockholders, completion of the review process by the Shanghai Stock Exchange, completion of the registration process by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and other factors, in a private offering to qualified buyers, in compliance with the requirements of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which would constitute up to 10 of ACM Shanghai s share capital prior to the transaction (the Private Offering ). 
 
 ACM Research estimates that if consummated in full, the proposed Private Offering would generate gross proceeds of up to RMB 4.5 billion 642.2 million) to ACM Shanghai, whose management would have broad discretion over the use of such proceeds. It is unlikely that any of such proceeds would be distributed to ACM Research. ACM Research's equity interest in ACM Shanghai, if the proposed Private Offering is consummated in full, would decline from 82.0 to approximately 74.6 . As of September 30, 2024 and the date of this report, the proposed Private Offering has not been completed.

O regon Clean Room Purchase 
 
 On July 30, 2024, ACM Research entered into an agreement to acquire a commercial facility, comprised of 39,500 square foot total floor space and which includes a 5,200 square foot functional clean room, for a price of 7.75 million. This facility is located in the City of Hillsboro in Oregon, and is intended to further expand ACM s R D and demonstration capability in the U.S. market. The purchase was completed on October 1, 2024. 
 
 Mainland China Government Research and Development Funding 
 
 Since 2008, ACM Shanghai has received various government grants for the development and commercialization of certain technologies, and the development of the R D and production center in the Lingang Special Area of Shanghai (note 13). The governmental grants contain certain operating conditions, in some cases require us to also invest certain amounts, and are subject to a government due-diligence review process upon completion of the project. The grants are recorded as long-term liabilities upon receipt, although we are not required to return any funds. Other subsidies are the subsidies received from government without further performance obligation. 
 Grant amounts are recognized in our statements of comprehensive income as follows: 
 Government subsidies are recorded as reductions of current expenses in the periods in which the qualified expenses are incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, government subsidies recognized as reductions of relevant expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income were 0.7 m illion and 1.5 million, respectively. 
 Other subsidies are recorded as other income in the periods as incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, related government subsidies recognized as other income in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income were 1.9 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 
 In 2019 ACM Shanghai sold a total number of shares representing 8.3 of its outstanding ACM Shanghai shares, after which ACM Research held the remaining 91.7 of ACM Shanghai s outstanding shares. In 2021 ACM Shanghai sold a total number of shares representing an additional 10 of its outstanding ACM Shanghai shares in its STAR IPO, after which ACM Research held the remaining 82.5 of ACM Shanghai s outstanding share s. However, in May 2023, ACM Research's ownership declined to 82.1 due to the exercise of 2,150,309 stock options related to ACM Shanghai shares. In June 2024, ACM Research's ownership further declined to 82.0 due to the exercise of 446,154 stock options related to ACM Shanghai sha res. As a result, we reflect the portion of our net income allocable to the minority holders of ACM Shanghai sha res as net income attributable to non-controlling interests. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates in applying our accounting policies that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements, and we therefore consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report and in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report, describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates included in our Annual Report.

 Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 v 2023 Absolute Change 2024 v 2023 (in thousands) Single wafer cleaning, Tahoe and semi-critical cleaning equipment 160,985 132,417 21.6 28,568 ECP (front-end and packaging), furnace and other technologies 34,600 25,508 35.6 9,092 Advanced packaging (excluding ECP), services spares 8,391 10,644 (21.2) (2,253) Total Revenue by Product Category 203,976 168,569 21.0 35,407 
 The increase in revenue for three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 reflects higher sales of single wafer cleaning, Tahoe and semi-critical cleaning equipment, and ECP (front-end and packaging), furnace and other technologies, partly offset by lower Advanced packaging (excluding ECP), services and spares. The increased demand is due in part to a longer term commitment by our mainland China-based customers to increase production capacity to achieve a greater share of the global semiconductor market. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 v 2023 Absolute Change 2024 v 2023 Cost of revenue 99,142 80,055 23.8 19,087 Gross profit 104,834 88,514 18.4 16,320 Gross margin 51.4 52.5 (1.1) (111)bps 
 Cost of revenue and gross profit increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 due to the increased sales volume, partly offset by a slight decrease in gross margin. The decrease in gross margin versus the prior-year period was primarily due to revenue mix between product categories, net of a favorable impact from fluctuations in the RMB to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Gross margin may vary from period to period, primarily related to the level of utilization and the timing and mix of revenue. We expect gross margin to be between 40.0 and 45.0 for the foreseeable future, with direct manufacturing costs approximating 50.0 to 55.0 of revenue and overhead costs totaling 5.0 of revenue.

 Sales and marketing expense decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 , reflecting a net decrease of 1.1 million due to costs for personnel, commissions, travel entertainment, outside service, professional services, and other expenses, offset by a 0.1 million increase in stock-based compensation. 
 
 Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of: 
 compensation of personnel associated with pre-sale and after-sale services and support and other sales and marketing activities, including stock-based compensation; 
 sales commissions paid to independent sales representatives; 
 fees paid to sales consultants; 
 cost of trade shows; 
 costs of tools built for promotional purposes for potential new customers; 
 travel and entertainment; and 
 allocated overhead for rent and utilities. 
 We expect that, for the foreseeable future, sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollars, as we incur additional costs associated with growing our customer base in mainland China and regions outside of mainland China. 
 Res earch and development expense increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, reflecting an increase of 2.7 million R D-related personnel and other costs, and 0.1 million in depreciation, outside services and other R D-related costs, offset by a 1.1 million decrease in costs of components for tools built for product development purposes. 
 Research and development expense represented 13.6 and 15.5 of our revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Without reduction by grant amounts received from mainland China governmental authorities (see Mainland China Government Research and Development Funding ), gross research and development expense totaled 27.9 million, or 13.7 of total revenue, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 26.4 million, or 15.7 of revenue, in the corresponding period in 2023. 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of: 
 compensation of personnel associated with our research and development activities, including stock based compensation;

General and administrative expense increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily reflecting a 1.4 million increase in stock based compensation, and a 2.7 million increase in allowance for credit losses, and a 0.6 million increase in personnel and other costs related to general and administrative costs. 
 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of: 
 compensation of executive, accounting and finance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation; 
 professional fees, including accounting and corporate legal and defense fees; 
 other corporate expenses including insurance; 
 allowance for credit losses; and 
 allocated overhead for rent and utilities. 
 We expect that, for the foreseeable future, general and administrative expenses will increase in dollars, as we incur additional costs associated with growing our business, operating ACM Research, as a public company in the United States and operating ACM Shanghai as a public company in mainland China.

 We recorded a realized gain from sale of short term inv estments of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.7 million in the prior-year period due to a sale of short-term investments (note 15). 
 We recorded an unrealized gain on short term investments of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an unrealized loss of 1.3 million for the same period in 2023, based on a change in market value of ACM Shanghai s short-term investments (note 15). 
 Income from equity investments was 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to loss from equity method investments of 0.2 million in the same period in 2023 due to an increase of net income from investments in affiliates (note 14). 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The following presents component s of income tax expense for the indicated periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Total income tax expense (4,007) (718) 
 
 We recognized a tax expense of 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a tax expense of 0.7 million for the prior year period. The tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from the tax effect of an increase in our effective income tax rate applied to an increase in operating profit for the period. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily due to an increase in capitalized R D expenses in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 Our effective tax rate differs from statutory rates of 21 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and 12.5 to 25 for mainland China income tax purposes due to the effects of the valuation allowance and certain permanent differences as it pertains to book-tax differences in the treatment of stock-based compensation and non-U.S. research expenses. Our four mainland China subsidiaries, ACM Shanghai, ACM Wuxi, ACM Beijing, and ACM Lingang, are liable for mainland China corporate income taxes at the rates of 15 , 25 , 25 , and 15 , respectively. Pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law of mainland China, our mainland China subsidiaries generally would be liable for mainland China corporate income taxes at a rate of 25 . According to Guoshuihan 2009 No. 203, an entity certified as an advanced and new technology enterprise is entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15 . ACM Shanghai was certified as an advanced and new technology enterprise in 2012 and again in 2016, 2018, and 2021, with an effective period of three years, and is expected to be re-certified for future years in 2024. In 2021, ACM Shanghai was certified as an eligible integrated circuit production enterprise and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 12.5 from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. Certain entities which meet requirements according to the Policy of the Lingang New area in China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15 . ACM Lingang was certified for this in 2021, and this

 preferential income tax rate is valid from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2024. We file income tax returns in the United States and state and foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 All tax returns will remain open for examination by the federal and state authorities for three and four years, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating loss or credits. Certain tax years are subject to foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities until the statute of limitations expire.

 The increase in revenue for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as co mpared to the same period in 2023 reflects higher sales of single wafer cleaning, Tahoe and semi-critical cleaning equipment, ECP (front-end and packaging), furnace and other technologies, and Advanced packaging (excluding ECP), services and spares. The increased demand from is due in part to a longer term commitment by our mainland China-based customers to increase production capacity to achieve a greater share of the global semiconductor market.

Table of Contents 

 versus the prior-year period was primarily due to revenue mix between product categories, net of a favorable impact from fluctuations in the RMB to U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
 Gross margin may vary from period to period, primarily related to the level of utilization and the timing and mix of revenue. We expect gross margin to be between 40.0 and 45.0 for the foreseeable future, with direct manufacturing costs approximating 50.0 to 55.0 of revenue and overhead costs totaling 5.0 of revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we funded our technology development and operations principally through our beginning global cash balances, including the cash balances at ACM Shanghai, borrowings by ACM Shanghai from local financial institutions, and our loan from China CITIC Bank, and cash flow from operations. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term time deposits and long-term time deposits were 369.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 304.5 million at December 31, 2023. The 64.6 million increase was primarily driven by 63.9 million of cash provided by operations, 78.6 million), excluding the change in net cash related to time deposits, used in investing activities, 77.0 million net cash provided by financing activities, and a 2.3 million increase from the effect of exchange rate on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and non-cash items. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits: Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 335,254 183,173 Short-term time deposits 20,304 80,524 Long-term time deposits 13,517 40,818 Total 369,075 304,515 
 Our future working capital needs beyond the next twelve months will depend on many factors, including the rate of our business and revenue growth, the payment schedules of our customers, the timing and magnitude of our capital expenditures, and the timing of investment in our research and development as well as sales and marketing. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term time deposits, our cash flow from operating activities, and bank borrowings by us and ACM Shanghai will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs within our longer term planning horizon. 
 ACM Shanghai has historically participated in certain mainland China government-sponsored grant and subsidy programs, as described under Mainland China Government Research and Development Funding and Contractual Obligations and we expect that ACM Shanghai will continue to take advantage of these programs when they are available and fit with our business strategy. ACM Shanghai generally applies for these grants and subsidies through the applicable mainland China government agency s defined processes. Periodically, the public relations department researches the availability of these grants and subsidies through mainland China government agencies with whom ACM Shanghai files business surveys and taxes. Management of ACM Shanghai then assesses which grants and subsidies for which ACM Shanghai may be eligible and submits the relevant application. The decision to award the grant to ACM Shanghai is made 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 by the relevant mainland China government agencies based on suitability and the merits of the application. Neither ACM Research, nor ACM Shanghai or any of our other subsidiaries, has any direct relationship with any mainland China government agency, and our anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months neither anticipate, nor require, receipt of any mainland China government grants or subsidies. 
 To the extent our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and short-term bank borrowings are insufficient to fund our future activities in accordance with our strategic plan, we may determine to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or additional bank credit arrangements. We also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses, technologies and products. If additional funding is necessary or desirable, we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or to obtain an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 Restrictions under mainland China laws and regulations as well as restrictions under ACM Shanghai s bank loan agreements, may significantly restrict ACM Shanghai s ability to transfer a portion of ACM Shanghai s net assets to ACM Research, other subsidiaries of ACM Research and to holders of ACM Research Class A common stock. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory Risks Mainland China's currency exchange control and government restrictions on investment repatriation may impact our ability to transfer funds outside of mainland China, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, otherwise fund and conduct our business, or pay dividends on our common stock in our Annual Report. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, with the exception of sales and services-related transfer-pricing payments in the ordinary course of business, and the dividend paid by ACM Shanghai to the stockholders of ACM Shanghai (including ACM Research), no transfers or distributions have been made between ACM Research, and its subsidiaries, including ACM Shanghai, or to holders of ACM Research Class A common stock. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were held for working capital purposes and other potential investments. ACM Shanghai, our only direct mainland China subsidiary, is, however, subject to mainland China restrictions on distributions to equity holders. The use of proceeds raised by the STAR Market IPO, without further approvals, are limited to specific usage. Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period, which affects our cash flow from operating activities. Fluctuations vary depending on cash collections, client mix, and the timing of shipment and acceptance of our tools. 
 ACM Research has never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock . AMC Research intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support the operation of and to finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The effect of exchange rate cash, and cash equivalents was 2.3 million during the first nine months ended September 30, 2024. The impact of fluctuations of the RMB to U.S. dollar currency exchange rate on a significant balance of these items held in RMB-denominated accounts (note 2) contributed to the change. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Grant Contract for State-owned Construction Land Use Right in Shanghai City 
 In 2020 ACM Shanghai, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ACM Lingang, entered into a Grant Contract for State-owned Construction Land Use Right in Shanghai City (Category of R D Headquarters and Industrial Projects), or the Grant Agreement, with the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone Lin-gang Special Area Administration, or the Grantor. ACM Lingang obtained rights to use approximately 43,000 square meters (10.6 acres) of land in the Lingang Heavy Equipment Industrial Zone of Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, or the Land Use Right, for a period of fifty years, commencing on the date of delivery of the land in July 2020, which we refer to as the Delivery Date. 
 In exchange for its land use rights, ACM Lingang paid aggregate grant fees of RMB 61.7 million 9.5 million), or the Grant Fees, and a performance deposit of RMB 12.3 million 1.9 million), which is equal to 20 of the aggregate grant fees, to secure its achievement of the following performance milestones: 
 the start of construction within 6 months after the Delivery Date (60 of the performance deposit), or Construction Start Milestone; 
 the completion of construction within 30 months after the Delivery Date (20 of the performance deposit), or Construction Completion Milestone; and 
 the start of production within 42 months after the Delivery Date (20 of the performance deposit), or Production Start Milestone. 
 Upon satisfaction of a milestone, the portion of the performance deposit attributable to that milestone will be repayable to ACM Lingang within ten business days. If the achievement of any of the above milestones is delayed or abandoned, ACM Lingang may be subject to additional penalties and may lose its rights to both the use of the granted land and any partially completed facilities on that land. 
 The status of the performance milestones for the period ended September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 ACM Lingang achieved the Construction Start Milestone and 60 of the performance deposit was refunded to ACM Shanghai in 2020. 
 The Construction Completion Milestone was required to be met by January 9, 2024 but was not achieved. However, ACM Lingang believes it will receive the refund without penalty based on its explanation to the respective regulatory authorities of logistics-related delays and expectations that it will meet the milestone in 2024. We cannot guarantee that ACM Lingang will achieve the missed milestone in 2024, or even if it does achieve the milestone in 2024, that it will be refunded some or all of the 20 portion of the performance deposit of RMB 2.5 million 0.4 million). 
 Contractual penalties in the case of a delay of Construction Completion Milestone : 
 If ACM Lingang fails to complete the construction pursuant to the date agreed under the Grant Agreement or any extended completion date approved by the Grantor, ACM Lingang shall pay 50 of the deposit for timely completion of construction as liquidated damages. 
 If ACM Lingang delays the completion for more than nine months beyond the date agreed under the Grant Agreement, or beyond any extended completion date approved by the Grantor, it shall pay the total deposit for timely completion of construction as liquidated damages. 
 If the delay is more than one year, the Grantor is entitled to terminate the Grant Agreement and take back the Land Use Right. In such case, the Grantor shall refund the Grant Fees for the remaining land use term after deducting the deposit agreed under the Grant Agreement and refund the deposit for timely commencement of production and relevant bank interests in full to ACM Lingang.

The Production Start Milestone is now required to be met by January 9, 2025. The Production Start Milestone was originally required to be met prior to January 9, 2024, but due to COVID-related delays, ACM filed multiple requests for extensions, the latest of which was granted on July 7, 2023. We cannot guarantee that ACM Lingang will meet any extended deadline or be refunded this 20 portion of the performance deposit. 
 Contractual penalties in the case of a delay of Production Start Milestone : 
 If ACM Lingang fails to commence production pursuant to the date agreed under the Grant Agreement or any extended commencement date approved by the Grantor, ACM Lingang shall pay the total deposit for timely commencement of production as liquidated damages; 
 If ACM Lingang fails to commence production pursuant to the extended commencement of production date (more than nine months beyond the extended p roduction start milestone), the Grantor is entitled to terminate the Grant Agreement and take back the Land Use Right. In such case, the Grantor shall refund the Grant Fees for the remaining land use term after deducting the deposit agreed under the Grant Agreement to ACM Lingang. 
 In addition to the milestones, covenants in the Grant Agreement require that, among other things, ACM Lingang will be required to pay liquidated damages in the event that within seven years after the Delivery Date, or prior to July 9, 2027, it does not (i) generate a minimum specified amount of annual sales of products manufactured on the granted land or (ii) pay at least RMB 157.6 million 22.2 million) in annual total taxes (including value-added taxes, corporate income tax, personal income taxes, urban maintenance and construction taxes, education surcharges, stamp taxes, and vehicle and shipping taxes) as a result of operations in connection with the granted land.

If the total tax revenue of the project fails to reach 80 of the standard agreed under the Grant Agreement within 1 month after the agreed date of reaching target production, the Grantor is entitled to terminate the Grant Agreement, take back the Land Use Right, and shall refund the Grant Fees for the remaining land use term to ACM Lingang. 
 If the Grant Agreement is terminated because of breach of any terms above, the Grantor shall take back the buildings, fixtures and auxiliary facilities on the land area and provide ACM Lingang with corresponding compensation according to the residual value of the buildings, fixtures and auxiliary facilities when they are taken back. The total cumulative investment of land, buildings and construction in progress related to ACM Lingang amoun ted to 153.5 million and 116.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 We present information below with respect to four measures of financial performance: 
 We define shipments of tools to include (a) a repeat shipment to a customer of a type of tool that the customer has previously accepted, for which we recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery, and (b) a first-time shipment of a first tool to a customer on an approval basis, for which we may recognize revenue in the future if contractual conditions are met, or if a purchase order is received. 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding interest expense (net), income tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization, unrealized (gain) loss on short-term investments, and stock-based compensation. We define adjusted EBITDA to also exclude restructuring costs, although we have not incurred any such costs to date. 
 We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (net of proceeds from disposals) and purchase of short-term and long-term investments. 
 We define adjusted operating income (loss) as our income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation. 
 These financial measures are not based on any standardized methodologies prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 We have presented shipments, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted operating income (loss) because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing our business. We believe that these financial measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and that the exclusion of property and equipment purchases from operating cash flow can provide a usual means to gauge our capability to generate cash. Accordingly, we believe that these financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. 
 Shipments, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted operating income (loss) are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Shipments 
 We consider shipments a key operating metric as it reflects the total value of products delivered to customers and prospective customers by our productive assets. 
 Shipments consist of two components: 
 a shipment to a customer of a type of tool that the customer has previously accepted, for which we recognize revenue when the tool is delivered; and 
 a shipment to a customer of a type of tool that the customer is receiving and evaluating for the first time, in each case a first tool, for which we may recognize revenue at a later date, subject to the customer s acceptance of the tool upon the tool s satisfaction of applicable contractual requirements or subject to the customer s subsequent discretionary commitment to purchase the tool. 
 First tool shipments can be made to either an existing customer that has not previously accepted that specific type of tool in the past for example, a delivery of a SAPS V tool to a customer that previously had received only SAPS II tools or to a new customer that has never purchased any tool from us. 
 Shipments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 709.7 million, as compared to 456.1 million for the same periods in 2023. Repeat tool shipments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 353.5 million, as compared to 232.1 million for same periods in 2023. First tool shipments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 356.2 million, as compared to 224.0 million for th e same periods in 2023. 
 The dollar amount attributed to a first tool shipment is equal to the consideration we expect to receive if any and all contractual requirements are satisfied and the customer accepts the tool, or if the customer subsequently determines in its discretion to purchase the tool. There are a number of limitations related to the use of shipments in evaluating our business, including that customers have significant, or in some cases total, discretion in determining whether to accept or purchase our tools after evaluation and their decision not to accept or purchase delivered tools is likely to result in our inability to recognize revenue from the delivered tools. First tool shipments reflect the value of incremental new products under evaluation delivered to our customers or prospective customers for a given period and is used as an internal key metric to reflect future potential revenue opportunity. The cumulative cost of first tool shipments under evaluation at customers which have not been accepted by the customer is carried at cost and reflected in finished goods inventory (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report). First tool shipments exclude deliveries to customers for which ACM Research does not have a basis to expect future revenue. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the nearest GAAP equivalent. Some of these limitations are: 
 adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future; 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 we exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), although (a) it has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy and (b) if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position; 
 the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense (benefit) or the cash requirements to pay taxes; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and 
 adjusted EBITDA includes expense reductions and non-operating other income attributable to mainland China governmental grants, which may mask the effect of underlying developments in net income, including trends in current expenses and interest expense, and free cash flow includes mainland China governmental grants, the amount and timing of which can be difficult to predict and are outside our control. 
 The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted EBITDA: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Change 2024 v 2023 Absolute Change 2024 v 2023 (in thousands) Adjusted EBITDA Data: Net Income 92,163 73,554 25.3 18,609 Interest expense (income), net (4,199) (4,299) -2.3 100 Income tax expense 17,712 11,235 57.7 6,477 Depreciation and amortization 7,073 6,021 17.5 1,052 Stock based compensation 40,792 14,666 178.1 26,126 Unrealized loss on short-term investments 1,151 4,428 -74.0 (3,277) Adjusted EBITDA 154,692 105,605 46.5 49,087 
 
 The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 reflects a 18.6 million increase in net income, a 26.1 million increase in stock based compensation, a 1.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a 6.5 million impact from a change in income tax expense, offset by a 3.3 million decrease in unrealized loss on short-term investment, and other items. 
 
 We do not exclude from adjusted EBITDA expense reductions and non-operating other income attributable to mainland China governmental grants because we consider and incorporate the expected amounts and timing of those grants in incurring expenses and capital expenditures. If we did not receive the grants, our cash expenses therefore would be lower, and our cash position would not be affected, to the extent we have accurately anticipated the amounts of the grants. For additional information regarding our mainland China grants, please see M ainland China Government Research and Development Funding.

 Free Cash Flow 
 The following table reconciles net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Change 2024 v 2023 Absolute Change 2024 v 2023 (in thousands) Free Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 63,855 (36,970) (272.7 100,825 Purchase of property and equipment (71,047) (49,535) 43.4 (21,512) Purchase of short-term and long-term investments (8,769) (6,488) 35.2 (2,281) Free cash flow (15,961) (92,993) (82.8 77,032 
 The improvement in free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 reflected the factors driving net cash used in operating activities, an increase of purchases of property and equipment, and long-term investment. Consistent with our methodology for calculating adjusted EBITDA, we do not adjust free cash flow for the effects of mainland China government subsidies, because we take those subsidies into account in incurring expenses and capital expenditures. We do not adjust free cash flow for the effects of time-deposits, which for our internal purposes are considered as largely similar to cash. 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 Adjusted operating income excludes stock-based compensation from income from operations. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments we utilize involves judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of our ongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors. Management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. The use of non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation has limitations, however. If we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher and our cash holdings would be

 less. The following tables reflect the exclusion of stock-based compensation, or SBC, from line items comprising income from operations: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Actual (GAAP) SBC Adjusted (Non- GAAP) Actual (GAAP) SBC Adjusted (Non-GAAP) (in thousands) Revenue 558,647 - 558,647 387,402 - 387,402 Cost of revenue (277,908) (2,020) (275,888) (190,263) (838) (189,425) Gross profit 280,739 (2,020) 282,759 197,139 (838) 197,977 Operating expenses: Sales and marketing (47,067) (8,645) (38,422) (37,579) (3,405) (34,174) Research and development (77,723) (12,082) (65,641) (60,244) (4,831) (55,413) General and administrative (48,940) (18,045) (30,895) (26,851) (5,592) (21,259) Income (loss) from operations 107,009 (40,792) 147,801 72,465 (14,666) 87,131 
 Adjusted operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 60.7 million, as compared with the same period in 2023, due to a 34.5 million increase in income from operations and a 2 6.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
 Our market risks and the ways we manage them are summarized in the section captioned Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report. There have been no material changes in the first nine months of 2024 to our market risks or to our management of such risks. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or may be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as set forth below, there were no material changes to the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I in our Annual Report. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider those risk factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future operating results. Those risk factors are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Regulatory Risks 
 
 The U.S. Government will implement an outbound investment review mechanism in early 2025, which may prevent us from taking advantage of investment opportunities outside the United States that could otherwise be advantageous to our stockholders 
 
 On October 28, 2024, the Office of Investment Security of the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a final rule to implement President Biden s August 2023 Executive Order on Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern (the EO). The EO provided for the establishment of a new and targeted national security regulatory framework directed at controlling outbound investment from the United States in certain sensitive industry sectors in the People s Republic of China (PRC) and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau (collectively, China). This rule is scheduled to be effective January 2, 2025. 
 
 As implemented by the final rule, the new framework would impose notification requirements and prohibitions on specified investments by U.S. persons in the semiconductor and microelectronics sector, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. 
 
 Within the semiconductor and microelectronics sector, prohibited investments will include certain covered investments in electronic design automation software; certain fabrication and advanced packaging tools; the design, fabrication, or packaging of certain advanced integrated circuits, and supercomputers. Notifiable investments will include any covered investments related to the design, fabrication, or packaging of integrated circuits not otherwise covered by the prohibition. 
 
 Given the breadth of the notification requirement as applicable within the semiconductor industry, we will likely be subject to increased regulatory burden to engage in certain investments in the PRC. Such a mechanism could negatively impact our ability to realize value from certain existing and future investments, including by limiting exit opportunities or causing us to favor buyers that may avoid complex notification requirements, even in circumstances where other buyers may offer better terms or more consideration. There can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain or proceed with investments on terms acceptable to us. It is possible that the outbound investment reporting requirements and prohibitions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , ACM Research issued, pursuant to the exercise of stock options at a per share exercise price of 0.50 per share, an aggregate of 621,186 shares of Class A common stock that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We believe the offer and sale of those shares were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) thereof (or Regulation D promulgated thereunder) because they did not involve a public offering. The recipients of the shares acquired the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends
