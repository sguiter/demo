 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, note receivable loan with a senior credit quality indicator met the definition of collateral-dependent and is collateralized by the membership interests in the borrowing entities and the associated land parcel. The Company used a market approach that uses quoted market prices to value the underlying collateral. The Company reviewed the borrower's financial statements, economic trends, industry projections for the market, and comparable sales capitalization rates, which represent significant inputs to the cash flow projections. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 in the fair value measurement hierarchy because they are unobservable inputs which are significant to the overall fair value. Based on the Company's analysis, the fair value of the collateral secures substantially all of the carrying value of the respective note receivable loan. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the collateral-dependent note receivable loan was million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and during the year ended December 31, 2023, the recoveries were primarily associated with cash collections pursuant to a settlement agreement with a borrower.

The Company provides certain services under its franchise and management agreements which result in direct and indirect reimbursements. The cost reimbursement revenues received from the franchisees are included in Hotel Franchising Management revenues and are offset by the related expenses in order to calculate Hotel Franchising Management operating income. The equity in the earnings or losses from the hotel franchising-related investment in affiliates is allocated to the Hotel Franchising Management reportable segment. 
 The Company evaluates its Hotel Franchising Management reportable segment based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, indirect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, interest income, and other gains and losses, all of which are included in the Corporate Other column in the tables presented below. The Corporate Other column also reflects the operations of the Company's owned hotels. 
 Intersegment Eliminations to revenues is the elimination of Hotel Franchising Management revenue which includes royalty fees, management and cost reimbursement fees charged to our owned hotels against the franchise and management fee expense that is recognized by our owned hotels in Corporate Other operating income (loss).

 Commitments 
 The Company had the following outstanding commitments as of September 30, 2024: 
 As part of the acquisition of Radisson Hotels Americas in August 2022, the Company entered into a long-term management arrangement, with an expiration date of July 31, 2031, to manage hotels owned by a third-party. As of September 30, 2024, the Company managed hotels pursuant to the long-term management arrangement. In conjunction with the management arrangement, the Company entered into a guarantee with the third-party to fund any shortfalls in the payment of the third-party owner s priority that is stipulated in the management agreement. The maximum guarantee under the agreement is million. The Company believes the future performance of the hotels is expected to be sufficient on both an annual basis and over the duration of the agreement. Accordingly, no liability was recognized as of September 30, 2024 in the consolidated balance sheets.

 million, if certain conditions are met. 
 The Company s franchise agreements require the payment of franchise fees, which include marketing and reservation system fees. In accordance with the terms of our franchise agreements, the Company is obligated to use the marketing and reservation system revenues it collects from the current franchisees to provide marketing and reservation services that are appropriate to support the operation of the overall system. To the extent the revenues collected exceed the expenditures incurred, the Company has a commitment to the franchisee system to make expenditures in future years. Conversely, to the extent the expenditures incurred exceed the revenues collected, the Company has the contractual enforceable right to assess and collect such amounts from the franchisees. 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into numerous agreements that contain standard indemnities whereby the Company indemnifies another party for breaches of representations and warranties. Such indemnifications are granted under various agreements, including those governing (i) purchases or sales of assets or businesses, (ii) leases of real estate, (iii) licensing of trademarks, (iv) access to credit facilities, (v) issuances of debt or equity securities, and (vi) certain operating agreements. The indemnifications issued are for the benefit of the (i) buyers in sale agreements and sellers in purchase agreements, (ii) landlords in lease contracts, (iii) franchisees in licensing agreements, (iv) financial institutions in credit facility arrangements, (v) underwriters in debt or equity security issuances, and (vi) parties under certain operating agreements. In addition, these parties are also generally indemnified against any third-party claim resulting from the transaction that is contemplated in the underlying agreement. While some of these indemnities extend only for the duration of the underlying agreement, many survive the expiration of the term of the agreement or extend into perpetuity (unless subject to a legal statute of limitations). There are no specific limitations on the maximum potential amount of the future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnities, nor is the Company able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of the future payments that could be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events are not subject to predictability. With respect to certain of the aforementioned indemnities, such as the indemnifications of the landlords against third-party claims for the use of real estate property leased by the Company, the Company maintains insurance coverage that mitigates any potential liability.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is intended to help the reader understand the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations of Choice Hotels International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Choice" or the "Company", "we", "us", or "our") contained in this report. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. 
 
 Overview 
 We are primarily a hotel franchisor operating in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 45 countries and territories. As of September 30, 2024, we had 7,515 hotels with 634,952 rooms open and operating, and 970 hotels with 110,380 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development, or committed to future franchise development on outstanding master development agreements (collectively, "pipeline") in our global system. Our brand names include Radisson Blu , Park Plaza , Cambria Hotels, Ascend Hotel Collection , Radisson RED , Radisson Individuals , Radisson , Radisson Collection , Clarion , Clarion Pointe , Comfort Inn , Comfort Suites , Country Inn Suites by Radisson, Radisson Inn Suites SM , Sleep Inn , Quality , Park Inn by Radisson , Everhome Suites , WoodSpring Suites , MainStay Suites , Suburban Studios , Econo Lodge , and Rodeway Inn . 
 The hotel franchising business represents the Company's primary operations. The Company's domestic operations are conducted through direct franchising relationships, the ownership of 12 open and operating hotels, and the management of 13 hotels (inclusive of four owned hotels), while its international franchise operations are conducted through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising relationships. Master franchising relationships are governed by master franchising agreements which generally provide the master franchisee with the right to use our brands and sub-license the use of our brands in a specific geographic region, usually for a fee. As a result of our master franchise relationships and international market conditions, our revenues are primarily concentrated in the United States. Therefore, our description of our business is primarily focused on the domestic operations, which encompasses the United States. 
 Our Company generates revenues, income, and cash flows primarily from our hotel franchising operations. Revenues are also generated from partnerships with qualified vendors and travel partners that provide value-added solutions to our platform of guests and hotels, hotel ownership, and other ancillary sources. Historically, the hotel industry has been seasonal in nature. For most hotels, demand is typically lower in November through February than during the remainder of the year. Our principal source of revenue is franchise fees, which is based on the gross room revenues or the number of rooms at our franchised properties. The Company s franchise and managed fees, as well as its owned hotels' revenues, normally reflect the industry s seasonality and historically have been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of the year. 
 Because our primary focus is hotel franchising, we benefit from the economies of scale inherent in the franchising business. The fee and cost structure of our franchising business provides opportunities to improve our operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms and the effective royalty rates in our franchise contracts resulting in increased initial franchise fees, ongoing royalty and licensing fees, and platform and procurement services fees. In addition, our operating results can also be improved through our company-wide efforts related to improving property-level performance and expanding the number of partnerships with travel-related and other companies with products and services that appeal to our guests. 
 The primary factors that affect the Company s results are: the number and relative mix of hotel rooms in the various hotel lodging price categories, growth in the number of hotel rooms owned and under franchise, occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels in our system, the effective royalty rate achieved in our franchise agreements, the level of franchise sales and relicensing activity, the number of qualified vendor arrangements and partnerships and the level of engagement with these partners by our franchisees and guests, and our ability to manage costs. The number of rooms in our hotel system and the occupancy and room rates at those hotel properties significantly affect the Company s results because our fees are based upon room revenues or the number of rooms at owned and franchised hotels. The key industry standard for measuring hotel-operating performance is revenue per available room ("RevPAR"), which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate ("ADR") realized. Our variable overhead costs associated with the franchise system growth of our established brands have historically been less than the incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises. Accordingly, over the long-term, the continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize the benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve our operating results.

 We are required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation system fees we collect for system-wide marketing and reservation system activities. These expenditures, which include advertising costs and the costs to maintain our central reservations systems, enhance awareness and consumer preference for our brands and deliver guests to our franchisees. Greater awareness and preference promote long-term growth in business delivery to our franchisees and increases the desirability of our brands to hotel owners and developers, which ultimately increases the franchise fees earned by the Company. Additionally, the Company's management agreements include cost reimbursements, which is primarily related to payroll costs at the managed hotels where the Company is the employer. 
 Our Company articulates its mission as a commitment to our franchisees profitability by providing our franchisees with hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise. We have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees success that focuses on delivering guests to their hotels and reducing hotel operating costs. 
 We believe that executing on our strategic priorities creates value for our shareholders. Our Company focuses on the following strategic priorities: 
 Profitable Growth - Our success is dependent on improving the performance of our hotels, increasing the size of our system by selling additional hotel franchises with a focus on revenue-intense chain scales and markets, improving our effective royalty rate, expanding our qualified vendor and partnership platform programs and maintaining a disciplined cost structure. We attempt to improve our revenues and overall profitability by providing a variety of products and services designed to increase business delivery and/or reduce operating and development costs. These products and services include national marketing campaigns, a guest loyalty program, a central reservation system, property and yield management programs and systems, revenue management services, quality assurance standards, and qualified vendor relationships and partnerships with companies that provide products and services to our franchisees and guests. We believe that healthy brands, which deliver a compelling return on investment, will enable us to sell additional hotel franchises and raise royalty rates. We have multiple brands that meet the needs of many different types of guests, and can be developed at various price points and applied to both new and existing hotels. This ensures that we have brands suitable for creating growth in a variety of market conditions. Improving the performance of the hotels in our system, strategically growing the system through additional franchise sales, and improving franchise agreement pricing while maintaining a disciplined cost structure are the keys to profitable growth. 
 Maximizing Financial Returns and Creating Value for Shareholders - Our capital allocation decisions, including our capital structure and the uses of capital, are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders. Since our business has not historically required significant reinvestment of capital, we typically utilize cash in ways that management believes provides the greatest returns to our shareholders, which include acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MD A for more information regarding our capital returns to shareholders. 
 In addition to our hotel franchising business, we have also developed or acquired 12 open and operating hotels. We intend to continue to strategically develop hotels to increase the presence of our newly introduced brands in the United States, drive greater guest satisfaction and brand preference, and ultimately increase the number of franchise agreements awarded. When developing hotels, we seek key markets with strong growth potential that will deliver strong operating performance and improve the recognition of our brands. Our hotel development and ownership efforts primarily focus on the Cambria Hotels and Everhome Suites brands. We believe our owned hotels provide us the opportunity to support and accelerate the growth of these brands. We do not anticipate owning hotels on a permanent basis and we expect to target dispositions to a franchisee encumbered with a long-term Choice franchise agreement in the future. 
 A key component of our strategy for owned hotels is to maximize revenues and manage costs. We strive to optimize revenues by focusing on revenue management, increasing guest loyalty, expanding brand awareness with targeted customer groupings, and providing superior guest service. Other than four owned hotels, we currently do not manage our owned hotels but utilize the services of third-party hotel management companies that provide their own employees. We manage costs by setting performance goals for our hotel management companies and optimizing distribution channels. 
 The Company also allocates capital to financing, investment and guaranty support to incentivize franchise development for certain brands in strategic markets. The timing and amount of these investments are subject to market and other conditions. 
 We believe our growth investments and strategic priorities, when properly implemented, will enhance our profitability, maximize our financial returns, and continue to generate value for our shareholders. The ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below. 
 Results of Operations - Royalty, licensing and management fees, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share represent the key measures of our financial performance. These measures are primarily driven by the operations of our hotel franchise system and therefore, our analysis of the Company's results of operations is primarily focused on the size, performance, and the potential growth of the hotel franchise system as well as our variable overhead costs.

 Our discussion of our results of operations excludes reimbursable franchise marketing and reservation system revenues and expenses and the management agreement cost reimbursements and expenses included in the Company's other revenues from franchised and managed properties and other expenses from franchised and managed properties . The Company's franchise agreements require the payment of marketing and reservation system fees to be used by the Company for the expenses associated with providing franchise services such as national marketing, media advertising, and central reservation systems. The Company is obligated to expend the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from its franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements. Furthermore, the franchisees are required to reimburse the Company for any deficits generated by these marketing and reservation system activities. Over time, the Company expects the cumulative revenues and expenses of reimbursable components to break even and, therefore, no income or loss will be generated from the reimbursable marketing and reservation system activities. Additionally, the Company's management agreements include cost reimbursements, which is primarily related to payroll costs at the managed hotels where the Company is the employer. As a result, the Company generally excludes the other revenues and other expenses from franchised and managed properties from the analysis of its operations. 
 Due to the seasonal nature of the Company s hotel franchising and management business and the multi-year investments required to support the franchise operations, quarterly and/or annual deficits may be generated. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other revenues from franchised and managed properties exceeded other expenses from franchised and managed properties by 20.1 million and 10.3 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other revenues from franchised and managed properties exceeded other expenses from franchised and managed properties by 17.7 million and 19.5 million, respectively. 
 Refer to the Operations Review section in MD A for additional analysis of our results of operations. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources - Historically, the Company has generated significant cash flows from operations . Since our business has not historically required a significant reinvestment of capital, we typically utilize cash in ways that management believes provide the greatest returns to our shareholders, which include acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. 
 We believe the Company s cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility, cash flows from operations, and access to additional capital in the debt markets is sufficient to meet the expected future operating, investing, and financing needs of the business. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MD A for additional analysis. 
 Inflation - We believe that moderate increases in the rate of inflation will generally result in comparable or greater increases in hotel room rates. We continue to monitor future inflation trends along with the corresponding impacts to our business.

 Results of Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized income before income taxes of 137.1 million, which is a 15.9 million increase from the same period in the prior year. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to a 16.7 million increase in operating income and a 5.3 million increase in other gains, all of which were partially offset by a 5.8 million increase in interest expense. 
 Operating income increased 16.7 million primarily due to a 9.8 million increase in the net activity generated from other revenues from franchised and managed properties and other expenses from franchised and managed properties, a 2.5 million increase in other revenues, and a 9.9 million decrease in business combination, diligence and transition costs, all of which were partially offset by a 5.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 The primary reasons for these fluctuations are described in more detail below. 
 Royalty, Licensing and Management Fees 
 Domestic royalty fees decreased 1.9 million to 131.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 133.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in domestic royalty fees is primarily due to a 2.5 domestic system-wide RevPAR decrease as a result of a 1.2 decrease in average daily rates and an 80 basis points decrease in occupancy during the current period, which was partially offset by a system-wide 6 basis points increase in the effective royalty rate from 4.99 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 International royalty fees increased 0.5 million to 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in international royalty fees is primarily due to an increase in the international franchise system size by 30 hotels (from 1,207 hotels as of September 30, 2023 to 1,237 hotels as of September 30, 2024) and 5,098 rooms (from 134,660 rooms as of September 30, 2023 to 139,758 rooms as of September 30, 2024), which was partially offset by a decrease in international RevPAR.

 Initial Franchise Fees 
 Initial franchise fees are generally paid to the Company when a franchisee executes a franchise agreement for a new property entering the franchise system, or an existing franchised property at the time of an ownership change (referred to as a relicensing), or a franchise agreement renewal; however, the recognition of revenue is deferred until the hotel associated with the franchise agreement is open or the franchise agreement is terminated. Once the hotel opens, revenue is recognized ratably as the services are provided over the enforceable period of the franchise agreement. If a franchise agreement is terminated, then the previously deferred initial franchise fees are recognized as revenue immediately in the period the franchise agreement is terminated. 
 Initial franchise fees revenue decreased 0.3 million to 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a lower number of domestic franchise agreement terminations as compared to the prior year. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 970 hotels with 110,380 rooms in its pipeline. Approximately 86 of our pipeline is located in the United States and approximately 71 of the domestic portion of the pipeline is new construction. After the execution of a franchise agreement, new construction hotels typically average 18 to 36 months to open, while conversion hotels typically average three to six months to open. 
 Fluctuations in its pipeline are primarily due to the timing of hotel openings and the timing of awarding new franchise agreements. While the pipeline provides a strong platform for growth, a hotel in the pipeline does not always result in an open and operating hotel due to various macroeconomic factors, including access to liquidity, availability of construction labor and materials, and local governmental approvals and entitlements. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes the costs to operate the business, increased 5.1 million to 49.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 44.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a 3.4 million increase in the Company's deferred compensation liabilities based on increases in the fair value of the underlying investments and a 1.0 million increase in the provisions for credit losses related to the issuance of new notes receivable. 
 Business Combination, Diligence and Transition Costs 
 Business combination, diligence and transition costs decreased 9.9 million to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the termination of the Wyndham acquisition pursuit on March 8, 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 5.8 million to 22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates on the Company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MD A for more information. 
 Other (Gain) Loss 
 Other (gain) loss increased 5.3 million to other gains of 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from other losses of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other gains was primarily due to a 3.5 million increase in the Company's deferred compensation assets based on increases in the fair value of the underlying investments and a net gain of 0.9 million on the sales of equity securities. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The Company's effective income tax rates were 22.9 and 24.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rates were higher than the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to the impact of state income taxes.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized income before income taxes of 293.9 million, which is a 7.4 million decrease from the same period in the prior year. The decrease in income before income taxes is primarily due to a 2.7 million decrease in other (gain) loss and an increase of 19.6 million in interest expense, all of which were partially offset by a 7.3 million increase in operating income and a 7.2 million increase in equity in net gain of affiliates. 
 Operating income increased 7.3 million primarily due to a 12.1 million increase in other revenues and a 12.9 million decrease in business combination, diligence and transition costs, all of which were partially offset by a 2.1 million decrease in royalty, licensing and management fees revenue, a 2.1 million decrease in initial franchise fees revenue, a 1.8 million decrease in the net activity generated from other revenues from franchised and managed properties and other expenses from franchised and managed properties, and an 11.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 The primary reasons for these fluctuations are described in more detail below.

 Royalty, Licensing and Management Fees 
 Domestic royalty fees decreased 7.3 million to 349.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 356.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in domestic royalty fees was primarily due to a 2.7 domestic system-wide RevPAR decrease as a result of a 1.2 decrease in average daily rates and a 90 basis points decrease in occupancy, all of which were partially offset by a 0.4 increase in open and operating domestic hotel rooms and a system-wide 6 basis points increase in the effective royalty rate from 4.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 A summary of the operating performance for the Company's domestic franchised hotels, organized by chain scale, was as follows:

 International royalty fees increased 0.8 million to 22.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in international royalty fees was primarily due to an increase in the size of the international franchise system, which was partially offset by a decrease in international RevPAR. 
 Initial Franchise Fees 
 Initial franchise fees revenue decreased 2.1 million to 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a lower number of domestic franchise agreement terminations as compared to the prior year. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues increased 12.1 million to 45.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 33.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in liquidated damages that resulted from the early termination of franchise agreements and other franchising revenues. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes the costs to operate the business, increased 11.3 million to 162.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 151.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a 2.4 million litigation settlement, an increase in the provisions for credit losses on accounts receivable balances, and a 4.2 million increase in the Company's deferred compensation liabilities based on increases in the fair value of the underlying investments. 
 Business Combination, Diligence and Transition Costs 
 Business combination, diligence and transition costs decreased 12.9 million to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the termination of the Wyndham acquisition pursuit on March 8, 2024 and substantially completing the integration of the Radisson Hotels Americas business in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 19.6 million to 66.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 46.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates on the Company's outstanding borrowings. Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MD A for more information. 
 Other (Gain) Loss 
 Other (gain) loss decreased 2.7 million to other gains of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from other gains of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a net loss of 8.3 million on the sales of equity securities, which was partially offset by dividend income of 1.5 million and a 4.0 million increase in the Company's deferred compensation assets based on increases in the fair value of the underlying investments. 
 Equity in Net Gain of Affiliates 
 Equity in net gain of affiliates increased 7.2 million to 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a distribution from an unconsolidated affiliate, which sold its underlying assets, so the Company recognized a gain of 7.2 million. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The Company's effective income tax rates were 23.8 for both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective income tax rates were higher than the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to the impact of state income taxes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our Company historically generates strong and predictable operating cash flows primarily from our hotel franchising operations. Our capital allocation decisions, including capital structure and our uses of capital, are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The Company's short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital needs, debt obligations, income tax payments, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and investments in growth opportunities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's primary sources of liquidity consisted of 675.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreements and the Company expects to remain in such compliance. The Company believes that its cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility, cash flows from operations, and access to additional capital in the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the expected future operating, investing, and financing needs of the business. 
 Our board of directors authorized a program which permits us to offer financing, investment, and guaranty support to qualified franchisees, and to acquire or develop and then resell hotels to incentivize franchise development of our brands in strategic markets. We primarily engage in these financial support activities to encourage acceleration of the growth of our Cambria Hotels and Everhome Suites brands. With respect to these activities, the Company had approximately 595.4 million in financial support of the Cambria Hotels and Everhome Suites brands reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company is generally targeting to recycle these investments within a five year period, and expects our outstanding investments to not exceed 1.2 billion at any point in time based on the current board of directors' authorization. The deployment and annual pace of future financial support activities will depend upon market and other conditions, including among others, our franchise sales results, the environment for new construction hotel development, and the hotel lending environment. 
 The Company also strategically deploys capital in the form of franchise agreement acquisition costs across our brands to incentivize franchise development. The timing and the amount of the franchise agreement acquisition cost payments are dependent on various factors including the implementation of various development and brand incentive programs, the level of franchise sales, and the ability of our franchisees to complete construction or convert their hotels to one of the Company s brands.

 The Company has historically generated cash flows from operating activities that are in excess of the capital needed to invest in growth opportunities and to service debt obligations. As a result, the Company maintains a share repurchase program and typically pays a quarterly dividend. On March 11, 2024, the Company's board of directors approved an increase of 5 million shares in the number of shares authorized to be repurchased under its share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 4.0 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. The projected 2024 annual dividend rate is 1.15 per share or approximately 56.0 million in aggregate dividend payments, which is subject to future declarations by our board of directors. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net cash provided by operating activities was 236.5 million and 247.2 million, respectively. Our operating cash flows decreased 10.7 million primarily due to an increase in the franchise agreement acquisition cost payments, an increase in deferred income taxes, and an increase in borrowing costs, all of which were partially offset by the timing of working capital items and a decrease in business combination, diligence and transition costs associated with the timing of the termination of the Wyndham acquisition pursuit during the first quarter of 2024 and the due diligence and transition costs related to the integration of the Radisson Hotels Americas business in 2023. 
 In conjunction with brand and development programs, we strategically make certain franchise acquisition cost payments to franchisees as an incentive to enter into new franchise agreements or perform-designated improvements to properties under existing franchise agreements. If the franchisee remains in the franchise system in good standing over the term specified in the incentive agreement, then the Company forgives the incentive ratably. If the franchisee exits our franchise system or is not operating their franchise in accordance with our quality or credit standards and is terminated, then the franchisee must repay the unamortized franchise agreement acquisition cost payment plus interest to the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's net franchise agreement acquisition costs were 84.1 million and 72.9 million, respectively. 
 The Company s franchise agreements require the payment of marketing and reservation system fees to be used by the Company for the expenses associated with providing franchise services such as national marketing, media advertising, and central reservation systems. Additionally, the Company's management agreements include cost reimbursements, primarily related to the payroll costs at the managed hotels where the Company is the employer. These activities are reflected in other revenues from franchised and managed properties and other expenses from franchised and managed properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the activity from other revenues from franchised and managed properties exceeded the activity of other expenses from franchised and managed properties by 17.7 million and 19.5 million, respectively. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 The net cash used in investing activities was 63.4 million and 103.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the following: 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, investments in owned hotel properties totaled 81.2 million and 45.5 million, respectively. These investments related to the continued growth of the Cambria Hotels and Everhome Suites brands and the ongoing hotel development efforts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, capital expenditures in other property and equipment totaled 33.6 million and 35.9 million, respectively. These capital expenditures primarily related to leasehold improvements, office equipment, and capitalized software. 
 The Company has equity method investments in affiliates related to the Company's program to offer equity support to qualified franchisees in order to develop and operate Cambria Hotels and Everhome Suites branded-hotels in strategic markets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company invested 47.7 million and 24.6 million, respectively, to support these efforts. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company received distributions from these affiliates totaling 15.9 million and 0.9 million, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds of 108.1 million from the sale of equity securities. There were no purchases of equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company did not purchase or sell any equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company provides financing to franchisees for hotel development efforts and other purposes in the form of notes receivable loans. The loans bear interest and are expected to be repaid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 24.4 million in notes receivable loans and received 2.3 million in notes receivable loan repayments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 4.3 million in notes receivable loans and received 9.9 million in notes receivable loan repayments.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to the proceeds or payments on the Company's borrowings, treasury stock repurchases, acquisition of shares in connection with the exercise or vesting of equity awards, the payment of dividends, and the payment of debt issuance costs.

 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement (the "Restated Credit Agreement"), which amended and restated the Company s existing amended and restated senior unsecured credit agreement dated August 20, 2018 (the Former Credit Agreement ). The Former Credit Agreement provided for an 850 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver with a final maturity date of August 20, 2026. The Restated Credit Agreement increased the commitments under the Revolver to 1 billion and extended the final maturity date of the Revolver to June 28, 2029, subject to optional one-year extensions that can be requested by the Company prior to each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the closing date of the Restated Credit Agreement. 
 The effectiveness of such extension is subject to the consent of the lenders under the Restated Credit Agreement and certain customary conditions. The Restated Credit Agreement also provides that up to 50 million of borrowings under the Revolver may be used for alternative currency loans, up to 10 million of capacity under the Revolver may be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and up to 25 million of borrowings under the Revolver may be used for swingline loans. The Company may from time to time designate one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company as additional borrowers under the Restated Credit Agreement, subject to the consent of the lenders and certain customary conditions. 
 At any time prior to the final maturity date, the Company may increase the amount of the Revolver or add one or more term loan facilities under the Restated Credit Agreement by up to an additional 500 million in the aggregate to the extent that any one or more lenders commit to being a lender for the additional amount of such increase or the term loan facility and certain other customary conditions are met. 
 The Restated Credit Agreement allows the Company to elect to have the Revolver bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate (subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 and a 0.00 floor) plus a margin ranging from 0.90 to 1.50 or (ii) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00 to 0.50 . In each case, the margin is determined according to the Company s senior unsecured long-term debt rating or under circumstances as set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement if the Company s total leverage ratio is less than 2.5 to 1.0. 
 The Restated Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay a fee on the total commitments under the Revolver, calculated on the basis of the actual daily amount of the commitments under the Revolver (regardless of usage) times a percentage per annum ranging from 0.075 to 0.25 (depending on the Company s senior unsecured long-term debt rating or under specific circumstances as set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement if the Company s total leverage ratio is less than 2.5 to 1.0). 
 The Restated Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its restricted subsidiaries comply with various covenants, including with respect to restrictions on liens, incurring indebtedness, making dividends and stock repurchases, making investments and effecting mergers and/or asset sales. The Restated Credit Agreement imposes financial maintenance covenants requiring the Company to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 to 1.0 and a total leverage ratio of not more than 4.5 to 1.0, which may be increased up to two nonconsecutive occasions to 5.5 to 1.0 for up to four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which certain material acquisitions are consummated. So long as the Company maintains an Investment Grade Rating, as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement, then the Company will not need to comply with the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. 
 The Restated Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Company under the Restated Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintained a total leverage ratio of 2.85x, including outstanding debt of approximately 379.2 million on the senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Restated Credit Agreement. 
 Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the Restated Credit Agreement are amortized on a straight-line basis, which is not materially different from the effective interest method, through the loan's maturity date. The amortization of the debt issuance costs is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. 
 The proceeds of the Restated Credit Agreement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, debt repayment, stock repurchases, dividends, investments, and other permitted uses as set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement.

 Economic Development Loans 
 The Company entered into economic development agreements with various governmental entities in conjunction with the relocation of its corporate headquarters in April 2013. In accordance with these agreements, the governmental entities agreed to advance approximately 4.4 million to the Company to offset a portion of the corporate headquarters relocation and tenant improvement costs in consideration of the employment of permanent, full-time employees within the jurisdictions. The Company has been advanced the full amounts that were due pursuant to these agreements, and these advances bore interest at a rate of 3 per annum. 
 Repayment of the advances was contingent upon the Company achieving certain performance conditions. The performance conditions were measured annually on December 31 st and primarily related to maintaining certain levels of employment within the various jurisdictions. If the Company failed to meet an annual performance condition, then the Company may have been required to repay a portion, or all, of the advances including accrued interest by April 30 th following the measurement date. Upon the expiration of the Company's previous ten-year corporate headquarters lease agreement in 2023, any outstanding advances would be forgiven in full. The 4.4 million of advances were previously recognized as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Upon the expiration of the Company's previous ten-year corporate headquarters lease agreement in 2023, the Company concluded that it had achieved the performance conditions over the entire term of the agreement and therefore, the Company is not required to repay the advances. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company derecognized the 4.4 million economic development loans debt from the consolidated balance sheets and recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of income. 
 Dividends 
 In March 2023, the Company's board of directors approved a 21 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 0.2875 per share, which is the current per share dividend amount that was utilized in each of the dividends that were declared in 2023 and 2024.

Table of Contents 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid 42.5 million in cash dividends. Based on the current per share dividend amount and our outstanding share count, the aggregate annual dividends for the year ended December 31, 2024 is projected to be 1.15 per share or approximately 56.0 million in aggregate dividend payments. 
 We expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future, subject to the declaration by our board of directors, future business performance, economic conditions, changes in tax regulations, and other matters. In accordance with the Restated Credit Agreement, the Company may not declare or make any dividend payments if there is an existing event of default or if the dividend payment would create an event of default. 
 Share Repurchases and Redemptions 
 In 1998, we instituted a share repurchase program. Treasury stock activity is recorded at cost in the consolidated balance sheets. On March 11, 2024, the Company's board of directors approved an increase of 5.0 million shares in the number of shares authorized to be repurchased under its share repurchase program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.8 million shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost, including accrued excise tax, of 341.2 million. In total, the Company has repurchased 61.1 million shares of its common stock (including 33.0 million shares prior to the two-for-one stock split effected in October 2005) under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 2.6 billion. Considering the effect of the two-for-one stock split, the Company has repurchased 94.1 million shares at an average price of 27.74 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 4.0 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed 0.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 11.7 million from employees to satisfy the option exercise price and the statutory minimum tax-withholding requirements related to the exercising of stock options and the vesting of PVRSUs and restricted stock grants. These redemptions were outside the share repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds of 9.3 million from stock options exercised by employees. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes. We have discussed the estimates that we believe are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment in their application and are based on information that is inherently uncertain in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the critical accounting estimates that were previously disclosed. 
 New Accounting Standards 
 Refer to the "Recently Issued Accounting Standards" section of Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to our evaluation of new accounting standards. 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain matters discussed in this quarterly report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain, but not necessarily all, of such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as "expect," "estimate," "believe," "anticipate," "should," "will," "forecast," "plan," "project," "assume," or similar words of futurity. All statements other than historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, assumptions and expectations regarding future events, which, in turn, are based on information currently available to management. Such statements may relate to projections of our revenue, expenses, adjusted EBITDA, earnings, debt levels, ability to repay outstanding indebtedness, payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, and other financial and operational measures, including occupancy and open hotels, revenue per available room, and our liquidity, among other matters. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Table of Contents 

 Several factors could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to, changes to general, domestic and foreign economic conditions, including access to liquidity and capital; changes in consumer demand and confidence, including consumer discretionary spending and the demand for travel, transient and group business; the timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases; future domestic or global outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases or fear of such outbreaks, and the related impact on the global hospitality industry, particularly but not exclusively the U.S. travel market; changes in law and regulation applicable to the travel, lodging or franchising industries, including with respect to the status of our relationship with employees of our franchisees; foreign currency fluctuations; impairments or declines in the value of our assets; operating risks common in the travel, lodging or franchising industries; changes to the desirability of our brands as viewed by hotel operators and customers; changes to the terms or termination of our contracts with franchisees and our relationships with our franchisees; our ability to keep pace with improvements in technology utilized for marketing and reservations systems and other operating systems; our ability to grow our franchise system; exposure to risks related to our hotel development, financing, and ownership activities; exposures to risks associated with our investments in new businesses; fluctuations in the supply and demand for hotel rooms; our ability to realize anticipated benefits from acquired businesses; impairments or losses relating to acquired businesses; the level of acceptance of alternative growth strategies we may implement; the impact of inflation; cyber security and data breach risks; climate change and sustainability related concerns; ownership and financing activities; hotel closures or financial difficulties of our franchisees; operating risks associated with our international operations; labor shortages; the outcome of litigation; and our ability to effectively manage our indebtedness and secure our indebtedness. These and other risk factors are discussed in detail in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies on the Company's foreign investments and operations. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through the monitoring of its available financing alternatives, including in certain circumstances, the use of derivative financial instruments. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our non-qualified retirement savings plan investments in debt securities and common stock, which have a carrying value of 48.8 million and 41.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are accounted for as trading securities. The Company will continue to monitor the exposure in these areas and make the appropriate adjustments as market conditions dictate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 383 million of variable interest rate debt instruments outstanding at an effective interest rate of 6.68 . A hypothetical change of 10 in the Company s effective interest rate from the September 30, 2024 levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by 2.6 million. The Company generally expects to refinance its fixed and variable long-term debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturities. 
 The Company does not presently have any derivative financial instruments.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company has a disclosure review committee whose membership includes the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), among others. The disclosure review committee s procedures are considered by the CEO and CFO in performing their evaluations of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and in assessing the accuracy and completeness of the Company s disclosures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report as required by Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company is not a party to any material litigation other than litigation in the ordinary course of business. The Company's management and legal counsel do not expect that the ultimate outcome of any of its currently ongoing legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The Company terminated its pursuit to acquire Wyndham during the first quarter of 2024; therefore, the risks associated with the acquisition of Wyndham that were included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are no longer material risks to the Company. Otherwise, there have been no material changes to the risk factors that were disclosed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, all of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future operating results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results.
