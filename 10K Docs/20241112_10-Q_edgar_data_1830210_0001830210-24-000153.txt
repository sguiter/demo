 opportunities to monetize Benson Hill s technology. First, licensing our germplasm to seed companies. Second, direct seed sales to farmers. And third, through technology access fees and value-based royalties from seed companies, processors and end users. 
 Our commitment to environmental and social issues impacting our planet and our purpose-driven culture are fundamental to our ability to achieve our mission. Environmental, Social and Governance principles help guide our thinking and approach throughout the development and commercialization of our products, and our innovative culture is rooted in our Core Values of Be Bold, Be Inspired, and Be Real. We believe our technology platform, asset-light model, and purpose-driven culture will help bridge the divide between evolving preferences and quality traits already present within the genetic diversity of soy. We see nature as our partner; technology as our enabler; and innovators like us, like-minded stakeholders, stockholders and partners as the catalysts to create a Made from Better soybean. 
 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP for financial reporting and Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulations. 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses, primarily to fund investment into technology and costs associated with early-stage commercialization of our products. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and respectively, and term debt and notes payable of and respectively, which are subject to repayment terms and covenants further described in Note 8, Debt in this report. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations, net of income taxes, of and , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had negative cash flows from operating activities of . As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities of . 
 As of the date of this report, we estimate that our existing cash and marketable securities of approximately as of September 30, 2024 will last through December 31, 2024, but will not be sufficient to fund our operations or meet our contractual commitments and obligations as they came due in the ordinary course of business for 12 months after the date our consolidated financial statements are issued. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, and do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of the Company s liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 We will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations and to execute our business plan, which capital may not be available on timely or acceptable terms, or at all. Likewise, as of the date of this report, management estimates that we will

 , in full payment of our outstanding obligations under the Convertible Notes Payable. Refer t o Note 8, Debt in this report for further details. We are decreasing cash required for our operations by reducing operating costs and reducing staff levels. We incurred severance costs of and , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included within selling, general and administrative expenses and net income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on our consolidated statements of operations . On May 7, 2024, the Company s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Dakota Dry Bean Inc. DDB amended and restated its credit facility, including to increase its term loan to million and to extend the maturity date to April 2029. Refer t o Note 8, Debt in this report for further details. I n addition, we are working to manage our current liabilities while we continue to make changes in operations to improve our cash flow and liquidity position. 
 Our liquidity plans and operating budget include further actions aimed at improving operating efficiencies by reducing certain operating costs, restructuring certain parts of our organization, exploring strategic alternatives, divesting our assets, supplementing cash by selling additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock to the public through our shelf registration statement, or otherwise, or obtaining alternative forms of financing which may or may not be dilutive. There are no guarantees that we will achieve any of these plans, which involve risks and uncertainties, or that our achievement of any of these plans will sufficiently address our substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In the event we are unable to secure additional financing to fund our obligations before the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, or to maintain covenant compliance, we will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, scaling back or discontinuing certain or all operations to reduce costs, closure of operations, sale of certain of our assets, a sale of the entire company to strategic or financial investors, and/or seeking protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws. 
 After market close on August 23, 2024, the Company transferred its stock exchange listing to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq from the New York Stock Exchange. The Company s common stock began trading on Nasdaq on August 26, 2024, and maintained the ticker symbol BHIL. The transfer to Nasdaq permits the Company to realize cost savings and facilitates the continued listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange.

 In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. As further discussed in the Reverse Stock Split section below, all per share amounts and common shares amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below). Results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ended December 31, 2024. A description of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2023 audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC and an Accounting Standards Update ASU of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ).

and the number of authorized shares of preferred stock remained at . On a retroactive basis, the Reverse Stock Split reduced the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock from to as of December 31, 2023. The par value per share of common stock remained at . 
 The Company s stockholders equity, in the aggregate, remained unchanged following the Reverse Stock Split. Per share net loss increased because there were fewer shares of common stock outstanding. There were no other accounting consequences, including changes to the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any period, that arose as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, holders of the common stock holding fractional shares were entitled to receive, in lieu of such fractional shares, a cash payment in an amount determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split. The cash payments were immaterial to the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Reverse Stock Split impacted all stockholders uniformly and did not affect any stockholder s percentage of ownership or proportionate voting power other than very minor impacts from the treatment of fractional shares. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act and have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards. We expect to remain an emerging growth company at least through December 31, 2024 and expect to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period, although we may decide to early adopt such new or revised accounting standards to the extent permitted by such standards. We expect to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and non-public companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act ). This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 In addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on such exemptions, we are not required to, among other things: (a) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (b) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (c) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (d) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last date of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (c) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the SEC rules with at least 700.0 million of outstanding securities held by non-affiliates or (d) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years.

years. The developed and acquired technology is amortized over its estimated useful life of years. Customer relationships are expected to provide economic benefits to the Company over the amortization period of years and are amortized on a straight-line basis. The amortization period of customer relationships represents management s best estimate of the expected usage or consumption of the economic benefits of the acquired assets, which is based on our historical experience of customer attrition rates. 
 Definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment, at the asset group level, whenever, in management s judgment, impairment indicators are present. At a minimum, we assess all definite lived intangible assets annually for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are present, such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible. If the review indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the intangible asset, the asset group is written down to fair value, and any impairment is assigned to the assets in the asset group in accordance with the applicable guidance, and a corresponding impairment is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets. However, we are currently exploring a broad strategic review of our business which could result in us being unable to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets. The amount and timing of any impairment charge would depend on a number of factors including the structure, timing, and scope of any assets disposed in any future transactions. 
 Stock Award Modifications 
 In June 2023, the Company announced that the former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) agreed to resign from the Company effective June 15, 2023, and entered into a consulting agreement to provide transition support through June 15, 2024. In connection with the separation, the Company modified the terms of its former CEO s outstanding stock awards to (1) continue vesting over the consulting period through June 15, 2024 if continuous service is achieved with the Company; (2) extend the period during which the vested stock options may be exercised for a period of 90 days following the termination of consultancy, if continuous service is achieved with the Company; and (3) extend the period in which performance-based vesting conditions for restricted stock units may be achieved through June 15, 2024, if continuous service is achieved with the Company. As a result of the stock award modifications, the Company recorded a million decrease to stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 On February 13, 2024, we sold all of our interests in a wholly-owned subsidiary, Benson Hill Ingredients, LLC Ingredients ), which owns and operates a soybean processing facility in Creston, Iowa, to White River Creston, LLC (the Purchaser for , plus a working capital adjustment estimated to be (the Purchase Price ), subject to certain deferred payments, holdbacks and other adjustments as defined in the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the MIPA (the Creston Sale . Upon closing the Creston Sale, we recorded a gain on the sale of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Upon closing the Creston Sale, of the Purchase Price (the Holdback and of the Purchase Price (the Carryback was held back by the Purchaser. The Holdback may be used by the Purchaser to satisfy certain Adverse Consequences (as defined in the MIPA) subject to the indemnification provisions, and for the Purchaser s recovery with respect to certain Facility KPIs (as defined in the MIPA). The Holdback, less any amounts due to the Purchaser under the MIPA terms, shall be paid to the Seller within following the twelve-month anniversary of the closing. The Carryback will be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to the terms of a promissory note executed by the Purchaser, and guaranteed by Ingredients, on February 13, 2024 (the Promissory Note ). Under the Promissory Note, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Carryback will be paid in equal installments on November 24, 2024, February 25, 2025, May 25, 2025, and August 25, 2025, together with all unpaid accrued interest on the outstanding principal amount on each such date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, interest will accrue on the outstanding and unpaid principal amount thereunder at a fixed rate equal to per annum. The Promissory Note may be partially or fully prepaid at any time without penalty. 
 The Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement TSA with the Purchaser, which is designed to ensure and facilitate an orderly transfer of operations. The TSA terms are four to with the option to extend for additional months. The TSA with the Purchaser expired in July 2024. TSA income is recognized as services are performed. 
 The Creston Sale and the Seymour Sale (collectively, the Transactions were separately marketed, negotiated, executed, and closed, and neither of the Transactions was conditioned upon the other. The Transactions were executed to leverage the Company s core competencies as a technology-enabled seed innovation company as the Company transitions from a vertically integrated business model to an asset-light business model with an expanded focus on animal feed markets. Exiting the soybean processing business is intended to strengthen the Company s balance sheet as the Company seeks to continue to commercialize our core business and intellectual property assets through partnerships and licensing arrangements to scale the Company s product innovations. In accordance with ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations , the Creston Sale was a strategic shift as the Company exited the ownership and operation of soybean processing assets. Therefore, the Transactions collectively met the criteria for transactions required to be accounted for as discontinued operations.

J J was the main component of our former Fresh segment. In accordance with ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations , our strategic shift to exit the former Fresh segment met the criteria to be classified as businesses held for sale and presented as a discontinued operation.

As of December 31, 2023, Public Warrants are available for trading over-the-counter under the symbol BHILW and are considered Level 2 liabilities. There were no other transfers of financial assets or liabilities into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 for 2024 or 2023. 
 All of our derivative contracts are centrally cleared and therefore are cash-settled on a daily basis. This results in the derivative contracts having a fair value that approximates zero on a daily basis. Therefore, there are no derivative assets or liabilities included in the table above. Refer to Note 6, Derivatives in this report for further discussion. 
 The warrant liabilities consist of PIPE Investment Warrants, Convertible Notes Payable Warrants, Notes Payable Warrants, Private Placement Warrants, and Public Warrants. History, fair value hierarchy, valuation techniques and inputs of those warrants are more fully described in Note 5, Fair Value Measurements and Note 15, Warrant Liabilities , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement entered into with the lender in October 2023, Convertible Notes Payable Warrants must be repriced based on the trailing 5-day VWAP immediately prior to the date of the Fourth Amendment. These warrant liabilities are valued based on Black-Scholes option pricing model.

 Convertible Notes Payable 
 In December 2021, we entered into a financing agreement with Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. (the Agent ), as administrative agent and collateral agent for several funds managed by the Agent (the Lenders (the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement ), which included a commitment by the lender to make term loans available to us in an amount of up to with available immediately. 
 We executed term notes with the Lenders in December 2021 in the aggregate amount of with an initial term of months payable in interest only, at the greater of (a) the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal or (b) per annum, plus per annum for the first months and principal and interest payments for the remaining months. The term notes were secured by substantially all of our assets. 
 In June 2022, we entered into a first amendment to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement, which among other things, changed the definition of gross margin, and modified the Conversion Price and the Exercise Price. The change to the definition of gross margin removed the impact of derivative hedging gains or losses related to future periods and resulted in our achievement of the milestones required to draw on the second tranche. We drew on the full available under the second tranche upon entering into this amendment. 
 In November 2022, we entered into a second amendment to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement, which, among other things, changed the definition of Outstanding Shares based on the updated definition of Market Cap Threshold I. Additionally, the required minimum liquidity covenant requirement was reduced from to . The amendment also increased the designated interest rate by basis points. 
 In March 2023, we entered into a third amendment to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement, which, among other things, allowed the restricted cash to be counted towards the required minimum liquidity covenant calculation. In addition, the amendment increased the final balloon payment by basis points and reset the prime rate to be the greater of (a) the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal or (b) per annum. 
 In October 2023, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement (the Fourth Amendment ), which, among other things: changed the maturity date to March 1, 2024; changed the prepayment fee to be equal to of any prepayment of Loans (as defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) for any prepayments made prior to January 14, 2024; increased the final payment from to of the original Commitment amount of ; within one business day after closing of certain sales of our equity securities, we must pay as a prepayment the lesser of (i) of the net closing proceeds or (ii) the outstanding principal of the Obligations (as defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement); within one business day of the closing of certain asset sales, we must pay as a prepayment the net closing proceeds from such asset sales; within one business day of either November 15, 2023 or the closing of certain asset sales, we must pay as a prepayment the lesser of (i) all cash in the Blocked Account (as defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) or (ii) the outstanding principal and pro rata portion of fees due, the financial covenant to maintain at all times a minimum liquidity equal to or greater than four or will be removed effective upon the lender s receipt of net closing proceeds from certain asset sales and all cash in the Blocked Account and following such removal, we will instead be required to maintain of unrestricted cash at all times, and the Warrants (as defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) must be repriced based on the trailing 5-day VWAP immediately prior to the date of the Fourth Amendment. 
 In November 2023, using the proceeds obtained from the sale of our soy processing facility in Seymour, Indiana, and other asset sales, we repaid approximately half of the outstanding obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement for an aggregate amount of .

 Upon the Avenue Capital Payoff, the Lenders commitments to extend further credit to the Borrowers terminated, the Agent released and terminated all liens or security interests granted to secure the obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement, and the parties to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement were released from their respective guaranties and obligations thereunder the (except for inchoate indemnity obligations). Upon the Avenue Capital Payoff, the Conversion Option (as such term is defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) to the Convertible Notes Payable has expired. The Convertible Notes Payable Warrants remain outstanding. 
 Equipment Financing 
 In March 2022, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction relating to certain of the Company s equipment. The Company evaluated whether the transaction qualified as a sale under ASC 606 and ultimately determined that since the leases are classified as financing leases under ASC 842, the transaction did not qualify as a sale and therefore control of the equipment was not transferred. Therefore, the sale proceeds of were recorded as a financing liability. We will make monthly payments of under the financing arrangement for a term of months.

 OVERVIEW 
 Benson Hill is a seed innovation company that unlocks nature s genetic diversity in soy quality traits through a combination of its proprietary genetics, its AI-driven CropOS technology platform, and its Crop Accelerator. We collaborate with strategic partners to create value throughout the agribusiness supply chain to meet the demand for better feed, food, and fuel. We are headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, where most of our research and development activities are managed. In October 2023, we announced plans to improve our financial position and accelerate our transition to an asset-light business model with a focused expansion into broadacre animal feed markets, intended to complement our accomplishments in human food ingredients. Under this transition plan, we intend to serve the animal feed market through an asset-light business model and secure partnerships and licensing agreements to scale our product innovations. I n February 2024, as part of our acceleration to an asset-light business model, we divested our soy-crushing and food-grade white flake and soy flour manufacturing operation in Creston, Iowa, which followed the October 2023 divestiture of our soy crushing facility in Seymour, Indiana. We continue to process dry peas in North Dakota through our Dakota Ingredients facility, and we sell our products throughout North America, in Europe and in several countries globally. 
 We believe that moving to an asset-light business model will enable us to focus on our research and development competitive advantage while participating across the value chain through partnerships that are more efficient to scale acreage, require less operating expense and are more capital efficient. This model maintains our ability to solve end-user challenges with seed innovation. As we analyze the asset-light business model across the value chain, we have identified three opportunities to monetize Benson Hill s technology. First, by licensing our germplasm to seed companies. Second, by direct seed and grain sales to farmers. And third, through technology access fees and value-based royalties from seed companies, processors and end users. In the future, we plan to enter the animal feed market and secure partnerships and licensing agreements to scale our product offerings. 
 The emergence of significant market headwinds in the food, aquaculture, and specialty oil markets, which are the markets where our collaboration efforts had been primarily focused, was a factor in our decision to reshape our business to best position our proprietary product portfolio and future product pipeline for significant growth. Recent advances in our soybean breeding program will drive the significant expansion of our commercial seed portfolio by 2025. The latest field evaluations on our third generation of Ultra High Protein Low Oligosaccharides, non-GMO soybean varieties showed protein gains of two percent over the previous generation and achieved a yield gap of only three to five bushels per acre, compared with commodity GMO soybeans. Our herbicide-tolerant HT Ultra High Protein UHP soybean varieties are on track for commercial release in 2025, with acreage and further portfolio expansion expected in 2026. This is a major step in providing farmers with options for weed control and enabling lower-cost, broadacre production of already advantaged UHP soybeans for the animal feed industry. 
 
 Transfer to Nasdaq 
 After market close on August 23, 2024, we transferred our common stock listing to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq from the New York Stock Exchange. On August 26, 2024, our common stock began trading on Nasdaq and maintained the ticker symbol BHIL. 
 
 Non-Binding Letter of Intent 
 As previously disclosed, on August 8, 2024, the Transaction Committee of the Board, on behalf of the Company, executed a non-exclusive, non-binding letter of intent with Argonautic (the Non-Binding Letter of Intent ), which summarizes the principal terms of a possible acquisition of Benson Hill (the Proposed Transaction by a to-be-established acquisition vehicle (the Buyer ). The Proposed Transaction would include the opportunity for certain Benson Hill stockholders (the Investor Group and such other stockholders, the Rollover Stockholders ), to exchange their Benson Hill Common Stock for newly issued equity in Buyer. The Proposed Transaction remains subject to numerous material conditions, including Buyer s

 satisfactory completion of due diligence; Buyer s securing an amount and type of financing satisfactory to the Company; recommendation of the Proposed Transaction by the Transaction Committee to the Board of the Company; and a non-waivable condition requiring that the number of shares of Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the tender offer represent a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock not beneficially owned by the Rollover Stockholders. Concurrently with the negotiation of definitive documentation, the Transaction Committee will continue to evaluate strategic alternatives through discussions with interested parties. There can be no assurance that the Non-Binding Letter of Intent will lead to a binding offer or definitive documentation, that the Transaction Committee or the Company will continue to pursue the Proposed Transaction or any other potential transaction, or that any transaction, whether or not relating to the Proposed Transaction, will eventually be consummated.

 Collaboration Agreement with ADM 
 On August 5, 2022, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and marketing rights agreement (the Collaboration Agreement with Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM to commercialize certain high-protein soy ingredients for the human food and nutrition market in North America based on certain of our proprietary commercial soybean seed genetics Proprietary Soy Genetics ). Pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to collaborate with ADM to engage soybean growers in certain parts of the United States to source production and supply of grain grown from Proprietary Soy Genetics for processing by ADM into soy protein ingredients. 
 On September 26, 2024, we terminated the Collaboration Agreement and replaced it with a non-exclusive seed supply agreement with ADM, effective September 7, 2024 (the New ADM Agreement to enable the potential commercialization and sale of certain of our proprietary high-protein soybean seed varieties High-Protein Varieties for ADM to originate and process in the United States into ingredients for the human and pet food markets worldwide. Pursuant to New ADM Agreement terms, we may work with ADM to engage soybean growers in the United States to source production and supply of grain grown from the High-Protein Varieties High-Protein Grain for processing by ADM into soy protein ingredients. We will receive processing fees for any soy protein ingredients that are processed by ADM from High-Protein Grain and will also receive proceeds from seeds of our High Protein Varieties sold to third party growers who contract to produce the High-Protein Grain. Unless earlier terminated, the New ADM Agreement will remain in effect until December 31, 2028, unless extended by mutual agreement.

 On July 18, 2024, following approval by our stockholders, we effected a 1-for-35 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). On July 19, 2024, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE on a post-split basis. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. Shares of common stock underlying outstanding warrants, stock options, and restricted stock units were proportionately decreased and the respective per share value and exercise prices, if applicable, were proportionately adjusted. 
 
 Repayment of Convertible Notes Payable 
 In December 2021, we entered into a financing agreement with an investment firm (the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement ), which included a commitment by the lender to make term loans available to us in an amount of up to 100 million with 80 million available immediately. We executed term notes with the lender in December 2021 in the aggregate amount of 80 million with an initial term of 36 months payable in interest only, at the greater of (a) the prime rate of interest as published in The Wall Street Journal or (b) 3.25 per annum, plus 5.75 per annum for the first 12 months and principal and interest payments for the remaining 24 months. The term notes were secured by substantially all of our assets. 
 In June 2022, we amended the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement and drew on the full 20 million available under the second tranche upon entering into this amendment. Through October 2023, we entered into additional amendments to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement which changed the terms of the loan including designated interest rates, covenant requirements and maturity date. 
 In November 2023, using the proceeds obtained from the sale of our soy crushing facility in Seymour, Indiana, and other asset sales, we repaid approximately half of the outstanding obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement for an aggregate amount of 58.4 million.

Table of Contents 

 On February 13, 2024, we repaid in full all outstanding obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement (the Avenue Capital Payoff ). In connection with the Avenue Capital Payoff, we paid an aggregate amount of 59.0 million in full payment of our outstanding obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement and the promissory notes evidencing the obligations thereunder. Upon the Avenue Capital Payoff, the lenders (as defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) commitments to extend further credit to us terminated, the agent (as defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) released and terminated all liens or security interests granted to secure the obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement, and the parties to the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement were released from their respective guaranties and obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement (except for inchoate indemnity obligations). Upon the Avenue Capital Payoff, the Conversion Option (as such term is defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) to the Convertible Notes Payable expired. The Warrants (as such term is defined in the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement) remain outstanding. Refer to Note 8 , Debt in this report and Item 1.02 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024 for additional information about the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement and the Avenue Capital Payoff. 
 
 Sale of Seymour, Indiana, and Creston, Iowa, Facilities 
 In connection with our execution of the expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan (see description below), on October 31, 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement with White River Soy Processing, LLC White River ), pursuant to which, among other things, we sold our soybean processing facility located in Seymour, Indiana, together with certain related assets, for approximately 35.4 million of total gross proceeds, which includes 25.9 million for the facility assets and the remainder for net working capital, subject to certain adjustments, including an adjustment for inventory (the Seymour Sale ). See Item 1.01 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 31, 2023 for additional information. 
 On February 13, 2024, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the MIPA with an affiliate of White River, pursuant to which, among other things, we sold all of our interests in our wholly-owned subsidiary, Benson Hill Ingredients, LLC Ingredients ), for 52.5 million , plus a working capital adjustment estimated to be 19.7 million , subject to certain deferred payments, holdbacks and other adjustments (the Creston Sale ). The primary business of Ingredients was the ownership and operation of a soy crushing and food-grade white flake and soy flour manufacturing facility located in Creston, Iowa. 
 The Creston Sale and the Seymour Sale (collectively, the Transactions represent the completion of an expected milestone as we implement cost and operational improvements as part of our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. These actions align with our commitment to disciplined liquidity management and asset efficiency as we transition to an asset-light business model backed by world-class soybean germplasm and competitively advantaged technology. We used the proceeds to improve our liquidity position, by fully retiring our high cost debt, and reducing our operating and working capital costs. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations in this report for further details on the Creston Sale and see Item 1.01 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024 for additional information. 
 The Transactions were separately marketed, negotiated, executed, and closed, and neither of the Transactions was conditioned upon the other. The Transactions were executed to leverage our core competencies as a technology-enabled seed innovation company as we transition from a vertically integrated business model to an asset-light business model with an expanded focus on animal feed markets. Exiting the soybean processing business is intended to strengthen our balance sheet as we seek to continue to commercialize our core business and intellectual property assets through partnerships and licensing arrangements to scale our product innovations. Following the Creston Sale, we exited the ownership and operation of soybean processing assets. The Transactions collectively met the criteria for transactions required to be accounted for as discontinued operations. As a result, we have presented the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the Transactions as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes for all periods presented. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations in this report for further details. 
 
 Expansion of Liquidity Improvement Plan 
 On March 27, 2023, our Board committed to a Liquidity Improvement Plan (the Liquidity Improvement Plan intended to improve liquidity by an estimated 65 million to 85 million by the end of 2024. We are executing the Liquidity Improvement Plan to create a more cost-efficient organization and enhance our capital structure to execute on our strategic priorities. On October 31, 2023, we announced an expansion of the Liquidity Improvement Plan to include the divestiture of certain of our soy processing assets in connection with our transition to an asset-light business model. On October 31, 2023, we sold our soy processing facility located in Seymour, Indiana, for 35.4 million of total gross proceeds, subject to certain deferred payments, holdbacks and other adjustments, and in November 2023, we repaid approximately half of the outstanding Convertible Notes Payable. On February 13, 2024, we sold our soy processing facility located in Creston, Iowa, for 72.2 million of total gross 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 proceeds, subject to certain deferred payments, holdbacks and other adjustments, and successfully retired our Convertible Notes Payable in full earlier than its maturity date. Through the combination of cash on hand, savings driven by our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan, net proceeds from our completed and any future anticipated asset dispositions, and securing additional financing, we expect to improve our liquidity position. We plan to use this anticipated liquidity runway while we seek to secure partnerships and licensing agreements to help us execute our long-term strategy. 
 We continue to implement cost-cutting actions associated with our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan and currently estimate that we will incur approximately 12.9 million in aggregate costs in connection with our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. Included in this amount are approximately 7.4 million in costs attributable to the sale of our Seymour, Indiana, and Creston, Iowa, facilities, and approximately 5.3 million of expenses we expect to incur relating to employee severance and benefits costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred immaterial charges and charges of 5.4 million, respectively, within selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations associated with our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. 
 
 Public Warrants Delisting 
 On December 18, 2023, we received notice from the NYSE that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist our Public Warrants, issued in connection with the Merger that closed on September 29, 2021, with each warrant exercisable for one share of our common stock at an exercise price of 402.50 per share (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split), due to abnormally low trading price levels pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. On December 19, 2023, the NYSE suspended trading in the warrants. On January 5, 2024, the NYSE filed a Form 25 with the SEC to report the removal of the warrants from listing. On January 15, 2024, the delisting of the warrants became effective. Since being delisted, our Public Warrants have traded over-the-counter on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol BHILW . 
 
 Divestiture of J J Produce, Inc. 
 On December 29, 2022, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement to sell J J Produce, Inc. and all of the outstanding equity securities of J J s subsidiaries for aggregate cash consideration of 3.0 million, subject to certain adjustments (the Stock Sale ). On June 30, 2023, we closed the Stock Sale. For more information, please see Note 3, Discontinued Operations in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. 
 
 RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS 
 We have made significant progress in our evolution to an asset-light business model, including the divestiture of our soybean processing facilities located in Seymour, Indiana, and Creston, Iowa. As part of our transition to an asset-light business model, management planned to see a reduction in the revenue and related costs associated with the divested soy processing operations. We are currently focused on expanding our revenue base, including through licensing opportunities and collaboration arrangements. 
 We have discontinued recognition of revenue and costs derived directly from the ownership and operation of soy processing fa cilit ies following the Creston Sale within our continuing operations. Within the condensed consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue and related costs from our divested processing facilities have been excluded. However, as we aim to maximiz e value and develop new markets for our seed technology, we have engaged in seed licensing and sales, direct sale s of both proprietary and non-proprietary grain, and toll manufacturing activity as part of our continuing operations. As a result, we continue to recognize revenue from these sources as part of continuing operations.

 Revenues 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 34.1 million, an increase of 10.6 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by higher grain sales of proprietary soybeans, higher revenue from partnerships and licensing agreements including revenue recognized from cancellations, and higher yellow pea revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue and related costs from discontinued operations related to the divested processing facilities have been excluded from the table above. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for the income statement impact of these discontinued operations. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 34.6 million, an increase of 12.7 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by higher input cost incurred from higher grain sales activity, somewhat offset by lower cost of sales associated with partnerships and licensing agreements during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.0 million, a decrease of 3.5 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was driven by reduced personnel-related costs and other technology costs in connection with implementing the expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. We continue to invest in critical technology costs, facilities expenses (primarily related to the Crop Accelerator facility) and workforce-related expenses to drive innovation in feed, food, and fuel with our CropOS technology platform. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 12.3 million, a decrease of 1.4 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced personnel-related and other costs in connection with implementing the expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.8 million, a decrease of 5.3 million, compared to the same period in 2023.

 reduction in the valuation of warrant and conversion option liabilities driven by changes in the share price of our common stock and equity volatility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 Total other (income) expense, net for the three months ende d September 30, 2024 was income of 0.2 million, compared to expense of 0.2 million in 2023 , an increase of 0.04 million. The small increase was driven by changes to the marketable securities balance. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 No net income tax benefit for net operating losses incurred in the U.S. has been recorded due to uncertainty in realizing a benefit from these items. The tax expense recorded for the three month period ended June 30, 2023 relates to minor state and foreign taxes.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 37.3 million, an increase of 3.8 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due to a non-recurring 7.8 million reversal to stock-based compensation expense in 2023. After factoring in this non-recurring decrease to stock-based compensation expense in 202 3, there was a decrease of 4.0 million to other selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023, driven by reduced personnel-related costs and professional fees. 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 As of June 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment to the carrying value of goodwill of 9.3 million in continuing operations and 10.0 million in discontinued operations, which represented the entire goodwill balance prior to the impairment charge. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.2 million, a decrease of 8.2 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was driven by less interest expense incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period on in 2023 after full repayment of the Convertible Notes Payable in February 2024. 
 Changes in Fair Value of Warrants and Conversion Option 
 Changes in fair value of warrants and conversion option for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were an expense of 0.2 million compared to income of 30.7 million in the same period in 2023.

 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 Total other (income) expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was income of (0.9) million, compared to expense of 2.6 million in 2023, a decrease of 3.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by a receipt of 2.1 million from a corporate-owned life insurance policy and other changes to marketable securities. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 No net income tax benefit for net operating losses incurred in the U.S. has been recorded due to uncertainty in realizing a benefit from these items. The tax expense recorded for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 related to minor state and foreign taxes. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure of performance not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). Among other financial metrics, our management reviews results of operations based upon Adjusted EBITDA. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net loss from continuing operations before net interest expense, income tax provision and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, changes in fair value of warrants and conversion option, realized (gains) losses on marketable securities, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, restructuring-related costs (including severance costs) and the impact of significant non-recurring items. 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in comparing our financial performance with the performance of other companies for the following reasons: 
 Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and interest expense, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing and capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired; and 
 Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, and facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. 
 Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 Although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
 Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring non-cash expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; 
 Adjusted EBITDA excludes other material non-recurring items; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) recurring changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and 
 We have and may in the future modify how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA; and 
 The expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. 
 Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below. A reconciliation of our consolidated net loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA is also presented below.

 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 12.6 million, which represents a reduction in loss of 1.7 million compared to the same period in 2023 . The improvement for 2024 was driven by a reduction in our operating expenses from actions associated with the execution of our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 32.1 million, which represents a reduction in loss of 11.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. The improvement for 2024 was driven by a reduction in our operating expenses from actions associated with the execution of our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes our ability to access sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations, and other commitments. We assess liquidity in terms of our ability to access cash flows from operations, marketable securities, sales of assets, sales of our securities, and available credit facilities and their sufficiency to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. To meet our payment obligations, we must have sufficient highly liquid assets and be able to move funds on a timely basis. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 Since inception, our primary sources of liquidity have been equity and debt financings. On September 30, 2024, our liquidity was comprised of cash and marketable securities of 14.4 million . 
 In November 2023, using the proceeds obtained from the Seymour Sale and other asset sales, we repaid approximately half of the outstanding obligations under the Convertible Notes Payable for an aggregate amount of 58.4 million. On February 13, 2024, we completed the Creston Sale and used the proceeds for the Avenue Capital Payoff. In connection with the Avenue Capital Payoff, we paid an aggregate amount of 59.0 million, in full payment of our outstanding obligations under the Convertible Loan and Security Agreement and the promissory notes evidencing the obligations thereunder. We have approximately 15.6 million in debt outst anding as of the date of this report, comprising term debt and notes payable. As of the date of this report, we have access to a revolving credit facility of up to 6.0 million, as capped by a defined borrowing base that could result in availability that is less than this amount, and noncurrent lease liabilities of 78.8 million. Certain of our debt instruments require adherence to financial covenants, including maintaining minimum liquidity and maintenance of a minimum cash balance, further described in Note 8 , Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. If we breach these covenants, the holder of the debt may declare all amounts immediately due and payable. In June 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a twelfth amendment to its existing credit agreement, which, among other things, extended certain maturity dates of term loans available under the credit agreement, and allowed our subsidiary to repay up to 2.7 million of subordinated debt without penalty. On May 7, 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary amended and restated its existing credit agreement, including to increase the term loan thereunder to 15.8 million and to extend the maturity date to April 2029 (the 2024 DDB Term Loan ). 
 In addition, our commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included capital expenditures to manufacture soy flour texturization ingredients, associated operating costs supporting the sale of products, and general administrative expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations o f 66.2 million and use of cash flows from operating activities of 40.8 million. 
 Our business prospects are subject to risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by emerging growth companies, including access to capital. We have incurred significant losses since inception, primarily due to investments to enhance our technological capabilities and costs associated with the early-stage commercialization of products. In April 2029, the 2024 DDB Term Loan becomes due and payable in full and there is a risk that we may be unable to repay in full the 2024 DDB Term Loan by such date. Further, there is a risk that we will not comply with certain financial covenants under the 2024 DDB Term Loan prior to maturity, including regarding maintenance of a minimum cash balance. In order to generate sufficient cash to offset the costs of funding continued investment in technology and to otherwise fund operations, we will need to raise additional capital and to identify additional sources of revenue, such as collaboration arrangements or joint operating activities, strategic partnerships and/or licensing opportunities. We are pursuing these opportunities, but we can make no assurances that we will be able to procure any such capital or additional revenue producing arrangements in a timely or favorable manner, or otherwise. We currently intend to obtain new equity or debt financing, which may be dilutive to our stockholders, but we can make no assurances that we will be able to secure any new financing on a timely basis or that the terms of any new financing will be favorable to us. 
 As of the date of this report, we estimate that our existing cash and marketable securities of approximately 14.4 million as of September 30, 2024 will last through December 31, 2024, but will not be sufficient to fund our operations for twelve months from the date hereof, and that we will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations and to execute our business plan, which capital may not be available on timely or acceptable terms, or at all. Likewise, as of the date of this report, management estimates that we will comply with our debt covenants through December 31, 2024. However, we have based these estimates of our cash runway and covenant compliance on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available capital resources or fail to comply with certain debt covenants sooner than we expect. 
 These factors, coupled with expected capital expenditures, indicated that, without further action, our forecasted cash flows would not be sufficient for us to meet our contractual commitments and obligations as they came due in the ordinary course of business for 12 months after the date our consolidated financial statements are issued. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 We have taken steps to mitigate such doubt. We are reducing cash required for operations by reducing operating costs and reducing staff levels. In addition, we are working to manage our current liabilities while we continue to make changes in operations to improve our cash flow and liquidity position. Our liquidity plans and operating budget include further actions that we believe are probable to be achieved in the 12 months after the date our condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. These actions include improving operating efficiencies by reducing certain operating costs and restructuring certain parts of our organization, exploring strategic alternatives, selling additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock through our shelf registration statement or otherwise, or obtaining alternative forms of equity or debt financing. There are no guarantees that we will achieve any of these plans, which involve risks and uncertainties, or that 
 36

 our achievement of any of these plans will sufficiently address our substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Through the combination of cash on hand, savings driven by our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan, and the other plans described above, we intend to improve our liquidity position to help fund our operations while we seek to secure partnerships and licensing agreements to help us execute our long-term strategy. 
 To grow our business, we will need to secure additional capital, which could be debt or equity financing and may lead to dilution of our common stockholders. We believe that our liquidity plans and operating budget described above will supplement our future strategic growth initiatives and our longer-term capital needs. We are continuously assessing our business plans and capital structure. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other investments. These capital requirements could be substantial. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the commercialization of certain of our products, our ability to secure strategic partnerships and licensing agreements and the amount of revenues they produce, our ability to continue to satisfy our financial covenants under our financing facilities, our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, and our success at implementing our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan and other cost-saving measures. We could potentially use our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of consolidated operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our repayment obligations, meet existing financial covenants or obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those more fully described under the heading Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of this report. 
 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is presented in the following table: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In Thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (40,759) (73,868) Net cash provided by investing activities 85,666 72,237 Net cash used in financing activities (53,990) (9,053) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (12) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (9,095) (10,684) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 16,081 43,321 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 6,986 32,637 
 Operating Activities 
 On a consolidated basis, net cash flows used by operating activities were 40.8 million and 73.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respective ly. The year-over-year improvement in our cash outflows of 33.1 million was primarily due to a lower use of cash on payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses from our exit from ownership and operation of soybean processing facilities and cost cutting measures driven by our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan. 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations were 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.6 million used in operating activities for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash inflows of 3.0 million from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by changes in working capital. 
 Investing Activities 
 On a consolidated basis, net cash flows provided by investing activities were 85.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 72.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in cash inflow of 13.4 million. The increase in cash inflow was driven by net cash received from the sale of discontinued operations of 58.4 million offset by lower purchases and redemptions of marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 There were 58.3 million net cash inflows from investing activities from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an immaterial amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 inflows is due to net cash received from the sale of discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 On a consolidated basis, net cash flows used in financing activities were 54.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.1 million for the nine months ende d September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 44.9 million of cash outflows from financing activities. The increase in net cash outflows from financing activities is attributable to the repayment of the Convertible Notes Payable of 59.9 million, partially offset by refinancing the 2019 DDB Term Loan of 15.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 No net cash flows were used in financing activities from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a source of cash of 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to repayments of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 The information set forth in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the SEC rules and regulations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from the information provided under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a description of our emerging growth company status. 
 Recent Accounting Guidance 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. See Note 2 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are described under the heading Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief E xecutive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Ch ief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Limitations on Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not a party to any material litigation or other material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business. Additional information can be found in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before you decide to invest in any of our securities, you should consider carefully the risks described in the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors , as well as the risks described below. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks referred to in this paragraph. 
 Our execution of a non-exclusive, non-binding letter of intent may or may not result in a completed transaction. The uncertainty surrounding the outcome of such transaction process could materially and adversely impact our business operations, interfere with our ability to attract and retain personnel, result in the incurrence of significant expenses and cause our stock price to be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely impacted. 
 As previously disclosed, our Board of Directors has formed a special committee of independent directors (the Transaction Committee to review certain strategic alternatives. As also previously disclosed, on August 8, 2024, the Transaction Committee, on behalf of the Company, executed a non-exclusive, non-binding letter of intent (the Non-Binding Letter of Intent with Argonautic Ventures Master SPC Argonautic ), on behalf of itself and other co-investors (collectively, the 13D Investors ), which summarizes the principal terms of a possible acquisition of Benson Hill (the Proposed Transaction by a to-be-established acquisition vehicle (the Buyer to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock not owned by the 13D Investors or their affil iates for 8.60 per share in cash. T he 13D Investors public filings state that the 13D Investors and their affiliates, together with another investor and its affiliates with whom the 13D Investors are engaging on a coordinated basis with respect to certain activities, currently beneficially own approximately 22.2 of our outstanding shares of common stock and that the composition of the 13D Investors may change. The Proposed Transaction would include the opportunity for 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 certain Benson Hill stockholders (the 13D Investors and such other stockholders, the Rollover Stockholders ), to exchange their Benson Hill Common Stock for newly issued equity in Buyer. The Company understands that the 13D Investors are continuing to pursue additional financing sources and are seeking to identify additional prospective Rollover Stockholders while it conducts due diligence. During the due diligence review, certain potential financing sources have expressed an interest in also considering a direct investment transaction, but as of the date of this report no proposal in that regard has been made. 
 The Proposed Transaction remains subject to numerous material conditions, including Buyer s satisfactory completion of due diligence; Buyer s securing an amount and type of financing satisfactory to the Company; recommendation of the Proposed Transaction by the Transaction Committee to the Board of the Company; and a non-waivable condition requiring that the number of shares of Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the tender offer represent a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock not beneficially owned by the Rollover Stockholders. 
 Except for certain provisions regarding termination of the Non-Binding Letter of Intent, reimbursement by the Company for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Proposed Transaction, and customary confidentiality and other provisions, the Non-Binding Letter of Intent is not binding on the Company. There can be no assurance that the Non-Binding Letter of Intent will lead to a binding offer or definitive documentation, that the Transaction Committee or the Company will continue to pursue the Proposed Transaction or any other potential transaction, or that any transaction, whether or not relating to the Proposed Transaction, will eventually be consummated. 
 Any definitive transaction documents that may be executed with respect to the Proposed Transaction could reflect important differences from the above description of the Proposed Transaction, including without limitation as to pricing, financing, and transaction structure. Even if definitive transaction documents are executed with respect to the Proposed Transaction or any other transaction, a potential transaction may not be completed if pre-closing matters such as regulatory approvals, due diligence or other conditions are not completed satisfactorily or within specified time frames. 
 Concurrently with the negotiation of definitive documentation, the Transaction Committee is continuing to evaluate strategic alternatives, including financing alternatives, through discussions with interested parties. 
 To the extent the trading price of the Company s common stock reflects a market assumption that a transaction will be completed, the Company s stock price could be adversely impacted if definitive transaction documents are not executed or a transaction does not take place. Uncertainty surrounding the outcome associated with the indication of interest subjects us to a number of other risks during this time. The Board s and management s attention is being diverted from normal business operations in part to focus on the potential transaction and other potential transactions, and we are incurring significant expenses, including advisory and legal costs, related to evaluating the indication of interest and other potential transactions, which are adversely impacting our financial results. The potential for a transaction may also interfere with our ability to attract and retain key personnel, who may be uncertain about their future roles. The commencement of litigation regarding the indication of interest, or any other potential transaction, also would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock. 
 We estimate that our existing cash and marketable securities of 14.4 million as of September 30, 2024 will last through the fourth quarter of 2024. We will require substantial additional financing, including to continue our operations, conduct necessary research and development activities and maintain covenant compliance, and, if additional financing is not available, we may need to significantly scale back operations, seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws, or cease our business. 
 We have inc urred significant losses since inception, primarily due to investments to enhance our technological capabilities and costs associated with the early-stage commercialization of products. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations, net of income taxes of 21.9 million and 66.2 million , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had negative cash flows from operating activities of 40.8 million . As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities of 14.4 million. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 587.7 million and term debt and notes payable of 15.6 million, which are subject to repayment terms and covenants further described in Note 8, Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report . We expect to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. As of the date of this report, we estimate that our existing cash and marketable securities of approximately 14.4 million as of September 30, 2024 will last through December 31, 2024, but will not be sufficient to fund our operations or meet our contractual commitments and obligations as they came due in the ordinary course of business for twelve months from the date hereof. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations and to execute our business plan, which capital may not be available on timely or acceptable terms, or at all. Likewise, as of the date of this report, management estimates that we will comply with our debt covenants through December 31, 2024. However, we have based these estimates of our cash runway and covenant compliance on 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available capital resources or fail to comply with certain debt covenants sooner than we expect. 
 We have invested and will continue to invest in technology and human capital and will require substantial funds to bring the current products in our pipeline to market and to grow our business by researching, developing, and protecting products not currently in our product pipeline. Our current available funds are not sufficient for all of these activities and we do not expect that we will be able to fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs through our current cash balances and operating cash flow alone. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we will need to secure additional capital. 
 The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the commercialization of certain of our products, our ability to secure strategic partnerships and licensing agreements and the amount of revenues they produce, our ability to continue to satisfy our financial covenants under our financing facilities, our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, and our success at implementing our expanded Liquidity Improvement Plan and other cost-saving measures. We could potentially use our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of consolidated operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our repayment obligations, meet existing financial covenants or obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all. 
 Our ability to raise funds will depend upon many factors, including conditions in the debt and equity capital markets, as well as investor and lender perception of our creditworthiness and prospects. The potential transaction process relating to the Non-Binding Letter of Intent may increase investor and lender uncertainty about our future and make it more challenging for us to raise capital. If we are unable to raise funds on timely and acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. In the event we are unable to secure additional financing to fund our obligations before the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, or to maintain covenant compliance, we will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, scaling back or discontinuing certain or all operations to reduce costs, closure of operations, sale of certain of our assets, a sale of the entire company to strategic or financial investors, and/or seeking protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws. This may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to continue operations, investors may suffer a complete loss of their investments in our securities.

 EX-10.1 FORM OF 2024 BOD RSU AWARD AGREEMENT

Document 

Exhibit 10.1 
 
 BENSON HILL, INC. RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
 2024 DIRECTOR AWARD 
 This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this Agreement is made and entered into effective July 18, 2024 (the Grant Date by and between BENSON HILL, INC. (the Company and the individual signatory to this Agreement you ). The Company adopted the Benson Hill, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan pursuant to which awards of Restricted Stock Units may be granted. 
 In consideration of the services you render to the Company, the Company hereby issues you 10,675 Restricted Stock Units (the RSUs ). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Company Common Stock upon vesting and settlement of the RSU. Your RSUs are subject to the following terms and conditions, as well as the terms and conditions of the Plan. Unless otherwise specified, capitalized terms used but not defined below have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan. 
 1. Vesting and Settlement . Your Vesting Start Date is July 18, 2024. Subject to your continued service, your RSUs will vest on the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date or next year's annual shareholder meeting. 
 If your service terminates for any reason before your RSUs fully vest, you will automatically forfeit all interests and rights related to your unvested RSUs upon such termination of your service. You will have no right or interest in any forfeited RSUs and neither the Company nor any Affiliate will have any further obligations under this Agreement. 
 Subject to Section 6 (Taxes) of this Agreement, any portion of your RSUs that has achieved the vesting requirements will be settled within 60 days following the applicable vesting date. Upon settlement of your RSUs, the Company shall (a) issue and deliver to you the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of RSUs that vest on the vesting date (subject to any reduction of delivered shares via a net settlement agreement with the Company for withholding tax purposes), and (b) enter your name on the books of the Company as the shareholder of record with respect to the shares of Common Stock delivered to you. 
 2. Restrictions . Subject to any exceptions set forth in this Agreement or the Plan, until your RSUs are settled in accordance with Section 1 (Vesting and Settlement) of this Agreement, you may not sell, transfer or encumber your RSUs (or any rights relating to your RSU) in any way. Any attempt to sell, transfer or encumber your RSUs (or any rights relating to your RSU) is wholly ineffective and, if you make any such attempt, you will automatically forfeit your RSUs and all of your rights to the RSUs will immediately terminate without any payment or consideration by the Company or any Affiliate. 
 3. Rights as Shareholder Dividend Equivalents . You do not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying your RSUs unless and until your RSUs vest and are settled by the issuance of shares of Common Stock. Upon and following the settlement of your RSUs, you will be the record owner of the shares of Common Stock issued in settlement of your RSUs and you will be entitled to all rights of a shareholder of the Company (including voting rights) unless and until you sell or otherwise dispose of such shares. 

If, prior to an unvested RSU s settlement date, the Company declares a dividend on the shares of Common Stock, the Company will credit an account with an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid to you had you been issued one share of Common Stock on the Grant Date for each unvested RSU Dividend Equivalents ). Dividend Equivalents shall be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture restrictions as the unvested RSUs to which they are attributable and shall be paid on the same date that the unvested RSUs to which they are attributable are settled in accordance with Section 1. To the extent vested, Dividend Equivalents credited to your account shall be distributed in cash or, at the discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of the Dividend Equivalents, if any. 
 4. No Right to Continued Service . Neither the Plan nor this Agreement confers upon you any right to be retained in any position with the Company or any Affiliate. Further, nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall be construed to limit the discretion of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate your service at any time, with or without cause. 
 5. Adjustments . If any change is made to the outstanding Common Stock or the capital structure of the Company, if required, your RSUs shall be adjusted or terminated in any manner as contemplated by Section 5 of the Plan.

The Committee may permit you to satisfy any applicable federal, state or local tax withholding obligation by any of the means provided in Section 16 of the Plan, including but not limited to the Company withholding from delivery of shares of Common Stock. 
 Notwithstanding any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding, the ultimate liability for all such taxes is and remains your responsibility and the Company (a) makes no representation or undertakings regarding the treatment of any such taxes in connection with the grant, vesting or settlement of your RSUs or the subsequent sale of any shares and (b) does not commit to structure your RSUs to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 
 This Agreement is intended to comply with Code Section 409A or an exemption thereunder and shall be construed and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements for avoiding additional taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Affiliate makes any representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Code Section 409A and in no event shall the Company nor any Affiliate be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by you on account of non-compliance with Code Section 409A. 
 7. Compliance with Law . The issuance and transfer of shares of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance by the Company and you with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange on which the Company s shares of Common Stock may be listed. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued or transferred prior to the effective date of the Company s Form S-8 Registration Statement and unless and until any then applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel. 

8. Notices . Any notice required to be delivered to the Company under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company s Chief People Officer at the Company s principal corporate offices.

 9. Governing Law . This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles. 
 10. Interpretation . This Agreement is subject to the Plan as approved by the Company s shareholders. The terms and provisions of the Plan as it may be amended from time to time are hereby incorporated by reference. In the event of a conflict between any term or provision contained in this Agreement and a term or provision of the Plan, the applicable terms and provisions of the Plan will govern and prevail. Either party must submit any dispute regarding the interpretation of this Agreement to the Committee for review. The Committee s resolution of any dispute is final and binding on both parties. 
 11. Successors and Assigns . The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company s successors and assigns. Subject to the restrictions on transfer, this Agreement will be binding upon you and your beneficiaries, executors, administrators and the person(s) to whom your RSUs may be transferred by will or the laws of descent or distribution. 
 12. Severability . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan or this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, and each provision of the Plan and this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law. 
 13. Discretionary Nature of Plan . The Plan is discretionary and may be amended, cancelled or terminated by the Company at any time, in its discretion. The grant of your RSUs in this Agreement does not create any contractual right or other right to receive any RSUs or other awards in the future. Future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company. Any amendment, modification, or termination of the Plan shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of your service with the Company or any Affiliate. 
 14. Amendment . The Committee has the right to amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or cancel your RSUs, prospectively or retroactively provided, that, no such action shall adversely affect your material rights under this Agreement without regard to this Section 14 without your consent. 
 15. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement transmitted by electronic means will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing an original signature. 
 16. Acceptance . You hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of the Plan and this Agreement. You have read and understand the terms and provisions the Plan and this Agreement, and accept your RSUs subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.
