CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are

 believe, estimate, intend, could, should, would, 
 may, seek, plan, might, will, expect, anticipate, 
 predict, project, forecast, potential, continue negatives thereof
or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying assumptions
and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be materially different from the results
of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

We
cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results
or conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any responsibility
for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places
throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations,
including statements about future business and financial performance or conditions, anticipated sales growth across markets, distribution

and gross margins, profits or losses, new product introductions, financing and working capital requirements and resources, control by
our principal equity holders and the other factors set forth under the section entitled Risk Factors . 

These
forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject
to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ
materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than
we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in

to - under normal
circumstances. The Fund expects to primarily take short positions in VIX Futures Contracts by shorting the next two near term VIX Futures
Contracts and rolling the nearest month VIX Futures Contract to the next month on a daily basis. As such, the Fund expects to have a
constant one-month rolling short position in first and second month VIX Futures Contracts under normal circumstances. 

The
Trust and the Fund had no operations prior to January 12, 2022, other than matters relating to its organization, the registration of
the Fund under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the sale and issuance to Dynamic Shares, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the Sponsor of five Shares at an aggregate purchase price of in the Fund. 

The
Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of Shares (each such block a Creation Unit ). Only Authorized
Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from the Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is an entity that
has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Fund. Shares of the Fund are offered to Authorized Participants in Creation
Units at the Fund s Net Asset Value NAV ). Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time,
Shares from any Creation Unit they create at a per-Share market price that varies depending on, among other factors, the trading price
of the Shares of the Fund on its listing exchange, the NAV and the supply of and demand for the Shares at the time of the offer. Shares
from the same Creation Unit may be offered at different times and may have different offering prices based upon the above factors. The
form of Authorized Participant Agreement and related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an
Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from the Fund, the Sponsor, or
any of their affiliates, any underwriting fees or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public. Shares of the Fund
commenced trading on NYSE Arca on January 13, 2022. On September 12, 2024, Dynamic Shares LLC, the sponsor of the Dynamic Short Short-Term Volatility Futures ETF WEIX 
or the Trust ), announced the decision to transfer the listing of the Trust from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE
Arca to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Cboe BZX ). The transfer was completed on September 30, 2024. This decision
was part of our ongoing evaluation of exchange platforms to better meet the evolving needs of the Trust and its shareholders. No action
is required by current shareholders, and the transfer is not expected to impact the trading or liquidity of the Trust s shares. 

The
Sponsor also serves as the Fund s commodity pool operator. Wilmington Trust Company serves as the Trustee of the Trust (the Trustee ).
The Fund is a commodity pool, as defined under the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ), and the applicable regulations of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC and are operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered
with the CFTC. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940
Act ).

For
as long as the Trust remains an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of certain exemptions from the various reporting
requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited
to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from
the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. The Trust will take advantage of these reporting exemptions until it is no longer an emerging
growth company. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
The Trust intends to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period.

Management
of the Fund has reviewed all open tax years and major jurisdictions (i.e., the last three tax year ends and the interim tax period since
then, as applicable) and concluded that there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns. The Fund is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably
possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. On an ongoing basis,
management monitors its tax positions taken under the interpretation to determine if adjustments to conclusions are necessary based on
factors including, but not limited to, on-going analysis of tax law, regulation, and interpretations thereof.

Upon
entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit and maintain as collateral at least such initial margin as required
by the exchange on which the transaction is affected. The initial margin is segregated as cash and/or securities balances with brokers
for futures contracts, as disclosed in the Statements of Financial Condition, and is restricted as to its use. The Fund maintains collateral
at the broker in the form of cash and/or securities. Pursuant to the futures contract, the Fund generally agrees to receive from or pay
to the broker(s) an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses. The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon closing of
a futures transaction. 

The
Fund invests in and has investment exposure to an actively managed portfolio of short positions in VIX Futures Contracts, which are based
on the CBOE VIX Index. VIX Futures Contracts, which are types of derivative contracts, are unlike traditional futures contracts and are
not based on a tradable reference asset. The VIX Index is not directly investable, and the settlement price of a VIX Futures Contract
is based on the calculation that determines the level of the VIX Index. 

Futures
contracts involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin. The
face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure the Fund has in the particular classes of instruments. Additional risks
associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the
market value of the underlying Index or commodity and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract. With futures contracts,
there is minimal but some counterparty risk to the Fund since futures contracts are exchange-traded and the credit risk resides with
the Fund s clearing broker or clearinghouse itself. Many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation
permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract, no
trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified times during the trading day. Futures
contracts prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation
of futures positions and potentially subjecting the Fund to substantial losses. If trading is not possible, or if the Fund determines
not to close a futures position in anticipation of adverse price movements, the Fund will be required to make daily cash payments of
variation margin. The risk the Fund will be unable to close out a futures position will be minimized by entering into such transactions
on a national exchange with an active and liquid secondary market.

staff of the Sponsor and its affiliates with respect to compliance matters in connection with marketing efforts. 

Shares.
Creation Units may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, the Shares are not
redeemable securities. Retail investors, therefore, generally will not be able to purchase or redeem Shares directly from or with the
Fund. Rather, most retail investors will purchase or sell Shares in the secondary market with the assistance of a broker. Thus, some
of the information contained in these Notes to Financial Statements such as references to the Transaction Fees imposed on purchases
and redemptions is not relevant to retail investors. 

Transaction
Fees on Creation and Redemption Transactions 

The
manner by which Creation Units are purchased and redeemed is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and Authorized
Participant Handbook. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit cash with the Custodian of the Fund. If
permitted by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, an Authorized Participant also agrees to enter into or arrange for an exchange of futures
for related position or block trade with the Fund whereby the Authorized Participant would also transfer to the Fund a number and type
of exchange-traded futures contracts at or near the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. Similarly,
the Sponsor in its sole discretion may agree with an Authorized Participant to use an exchange of futures for related position to effect
an order to redeem Creation Units. 

Authorized
Participants pay a fixed transaction fee of up to in connection with each order to create or redeem a Creation Unit to compensate
the Administrator, the Custodian and the Transfer Agent of the Fund and its Shares, for services in processing the creation and redemption
of Creation Units and to offset the costs of increasing or decreasing derivative positions. The Sponsor provides such Authorized Participant
with prompt notice in advance of any such waiver or adjustment of the transaction fee. Authorized Participants may sell the Shares included

While
the Fund seeks to meet its investment objective, there is no guarantee the Fund will do so. Factors that may affect the Fund s
ability to meet its investment objective include: (1) the Sponsor s ability to purchase and sell financial instruments in a manner
that correlates to the Fund s objective; (2) an imperfect correlation between the performance of the financial instruments held
by the Fund and the performance of the applicable benchmark; (3) bid-ask spreads on such financial instruments; (4) fees, expenses, transaction
costs, financing costs associated with the use of financial instruments and commission costs; (5) holding or trading instruments in a
market that has become illiquid or disrupted; (6) the Fund s Share prices being rounded to the nearest cent and/or valuation methodology;
(7) changes to a benchmark Index that are not disseminated in advance; (8) the need to conform the Fund s portfolio holdings to
comply with investment restrictions or policies or regulatory or tax law requirements; (9) early and unanticipated closings of the markets
on which the holdings of the Fund trade, resulting in the inability of the Fund to execute intended portfolio transactions; (10) accounting
standards; and (11) differences caused by the Fund obtaining exposure to only a representative sample of the components of a benchmark,
over weighting or under weighting certain components of a benchmark or obtaining exposure to assets that are not included in a benchmark. 

A
number of factors may affect the Fund s ability to achieve a high degree of correlation with its benchmark, and there can be no
guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation. Failure to achieve a high degree of correlation may prevent the Fund
from achieving its investment objective. In order to achieve a high degree of correlation with their underlying benchmarks, the Fund
seeks to rebalance its portfolios daily to keep exposure consistent with their investment objectives. Being materially under- or over-exposed
to the benchmark may prevent the Fund from achieving a high degree of correlation with such benchmark. Market disruptions or closure,
large amounts of assets into or out of the Fund, regulatory restrictions, extreme market volatility, and other factors will adversely
affect the Fund s ability to adjust exposure to requisite levels. The target amount of portfolio exposure is impacted dynamically
by the benchmarks movements during each day. Other things being equal, more significant movement in the value of its benchmark
up or down will require more significant adjustments to the Fund s portfolio. Because of this, it is unlikely that the Fund will
be perfectly exposed (i.e., -0.5x) to its benchmark at the end of each day, and the likelihood of being materially under- or over-exposed
is higher on days when the benchmark levels are volatile near the close of the trading day. 

Counterparty
Risk 

The
Fund may use derivatives such as swap agreements and forward contracts (collectively referred to herein as derivatives in the manner described herein as a means to achieve its investment objectives. The use of derivatives by the Fund exposes the Fund to
counterparty risks. 

Regulatory
Treatment 

Derivatives
are generally traded in OTC markets and have only recently become subject to comprehensive regulation in the United States. Cash-settled
forwards are generally regulated as swaps , whereas physically settled forwards are generally not subject to regulation
(in the case of commodities other than currencies) or subject to the federal securities laws (in the case of securities).

Title
VII of the Dodd-Frank Act Title VII created a regulatory regime for derivatives, with the CFTC responsible for the regulation
of swaps and the SEC responsible for the regulation of security-based swaps. The SEC requirements have largely yet to be
made effective, but the CFTC requirements are largely in place. The CFTC requirements have included rules for some of the types of transactions
in which the Fund will engage, including mandatory clearing and exchange trading, reporting, and margin for OTC swaps. Title VII also
created new categories of regulated market participants, such as swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, 
 major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants who are, or will be, subject to significant
new capital, registration, recordkeeping, reporting, disclosure, business conduct and other regulatory requirements. The regulatory requirements
under Title VII continue to be developed and there may be further modifications that could materially and adversely impact the Fund,
the markets in which the Fund trades and the counterparties with which the Fund engages in transactions. 

As
noted, the CFTC rules may not apply to all of the swap agreements and forward contracts that may be entered into by the Fund. Investors,
therefore, may not receive the protection of CFTC regulation or the statutory scheme of the CEA in connection with the Fund s swap
agreements or forward contracts. The lack of regulation in these markets could expose investors to significant losses under certain circumstances,
including in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants. 

Counterparty
Credit Risk 

When
the Fund enters into futures contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. 

The
counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges as well as certain swaps is the clearing
house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required
to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce
this credit risk. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges, which may become
applicable in the future), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

The
Sponsor attempts to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally: 

executing
 and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor; 

limiting
 the outstanding amounts due from counterparties to the Fund; 

not
 posting margin directly with a counterparty; 

requiring
 that the counterparty posts collateral in amounts approximately equal to that owed to the Fund, as marked to market daily, subject
 to certain minimum thresholds; and 

limiting
 the amount of margin or premium posted at a Futures Commission Merchant FCM ). 

Any
OTC derivatives of the type that may be utilized by the Fund are generally less liquid than futures contracts because they are not traded
on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are generally entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties
and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
These agreements contain various conditions, events of default, termination events, covenants and representations. The triggering of
certain events or the default on certain terms of the agreement could allow a party to terminate a transaction under the agreement and
request immediate payment in an amount equal to the net positions owed to the party under the agreement. For example, if the level of
the Fund s benchmark has a dramatic intraday move that would cause a material decline in the Fund s NAV, the terms of the
swap may permit the counterparty to immediately close out the transaction with the Fund. In that event, it may not be possible for the
Fund to enter into another swap or to invest in other financial instruments necessary to achieve the desired exposure consistent with
the Fund s objective. This, in turn, may prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective, particularly if the level of
the Fund s benchmark reverses all or part of its intraday move by the end of the day.

The
Sponsor regularly reviews the performance of its counterparties for, among other things, creditworthiness and execution quality. In addition,
the Sponsor periodically considers the addition of new counterparties and the counterparties used by the Fund may change at any time.
Each day, the Fund discloses its portfolio holdings as of the prior Business Day. The Fund s portfolio holdings identifies its
counterparties, as applicable. This portfolio holdings information may be accessed through the web on the Sponsor s website at
www.dynamicsharesetf.com. The information on the Sponsor s website is for information only and is not incorporated by reference
herein. 

Each
counterparty and/or any of its affiliates may be an Authorized Participant or shareholder of the Fund, subject to applicable law. 

Leverage
Risk 

The
Fund s investment in derivative instruments generally requires a small investment relative to the amount of investment exposure
assumed. As a result, such investments may give rise to losses that exceed the amount invested in those instruments. The more the Fund
invests in derivative instruments that give rise to leverage, the more this leverage will magnify any losses on those investments. Leverage
will cause the value of the Fund s Shares to be more volatile than if the Fund did not use leverage. This is because leverage tends
to exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund s portfolio or other investments. The use of leverage
also may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to
meet segregation requirements. Certain types of leveraging transactions, such as short sales that are not against the box, 
could theoretically be subject to unlimited losses in cases where the Fund, for any reason, is unable to close out the transaction. In
addition, to the extent the Fund borrows money, interest costs on such borrowed money may not be recovered by any appreciation of the
financial instruments purchased with the borrowed funds and could exceed the Fund s investment income, resulting in greater losses.
The cost of investing in such instruments generally increases as interest rates increase, which will lower the Fund s return. 

Liquidity
Risk 

The
Fund will invest in derivatives and other instruments that may be less liquid than other types of investments. Investments that are less
liquid or that trade less can be more difficult or costlier to buy, or to sell, compared to other more liquid or active investments.
This liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular investment, as well as the size and liquidity of the market for
such an investment. The derivatives in which the Fund invests may not always be liquid. The large size of the positions which the Fund
may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred
while trying to do so. Any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially be exacerbated due to the fact that the Fund will typically
invest in financial instruments related to one index. A lack of liquidity could have a negative effect on the Fund s ability to
achieve its investment objective and may result in losses to Fund shareholders. 

Contango 
and Backwardation Risk 

The
futures contracts held by the Fund, as the futures contracts near expiration, are generally replaced by contracts that have a later expiration.
Thus, for example, a contract purchased and held in November 2019 may specify a January 2020 expiration. As that contract nears expiration,
it may be replaced by selling the January 2020 contract and purchasing the contract expiring in March 2020. This process is referred
to as rolling. Rolling may have a positive or negative impact on performance. For example, historically, the prices of
certain types of futures contracts have frequently been higher for contracts with shorter-term expirations than for contracts with longer-term
expirations, which is referred to as backwardation. In these circumstances, absent other factors, the sale of the January
2020 contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price at which the March 2020 contract is purchased, thereby creating
a gain in connection with rolling. While certain types of futures contracts have historically exhibited consistent periods of backwardation,
backwardation will likely not exist in these markets at all times. The presence of contango (where prices of contracts are higher in
the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months due to the costs of long-term storage of a physical commodity prior to
delivery or other factors) in certain futures contracts at the time of rolling would be expected to positively affect the Fund. Similarly,
the presence of backwardation in certain futures contracts at the time of rolling such contracts would be expected to adversely affect
the Fund. 

Since
the introduction of VIX futures contracts, there have frequently been periods where VIX futures prices reflect higher expected volatility
levels further out in time. This can result in a loss from rolling the VIX futures to maintain the constant weighted average
maturity of the applicable VIX Futures Index.

Natural
Disaster/Epidemic Risk 

Natural
or environmental disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis and other severe weather-related phenomena generally,
and widespread disease, including pandemics and epidemics (for example, the novel coronavirus COVID-19), have been and can be highly
disruptive to economies and markets and have recently led, and may continue to lead, to increased market volatility and significant market
losses. Such natural disaster and health crises could exacerbate political, social, and economic risks mentioned herein, and result in
significant breakdowns, delays, shutdowns, social isolation, and other disruptions to important global, local and regional supply chains
affected, with potential corresponding results on the operating performance of the Fund and its investments. A climate of uncertainty
and panic, including the contagion of infectious viruses or diseases, may adversely affect global, regional, and local economies and
increase the difficulty of modeling market conditions, potentially reducing the accuracy of financial projections. Under these circumstances,
the Fund may have difficulty achieving its investment objective which may adversely impact performance. Further, such events can be highly
disruptive to economies and markets, significantly disrupt the operations of individual companies (including, but not limited to, the
Fund s Sponsor and third party service providers), sectors, industries, markets, securities and commodity exchanges, currencies,
interest and inflation rates, credit ratings, investor sentiment, and other factors affecting the value of the Fund s investments.
For instance, prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, the Sponsor anticipated a lower breakeven amount for the Fund because the
Sponsor expected interest income from the Fund s investments to offset the Fund s estimated fees, costs and expenses. Due
to market conditions following the COVID-19 epidemic, the Fund s interest income is assumed to be zero, and the amount of trading
income the Fund needs to achieve to breakeven is higher than the Sponsor anticipated prior to the COVID-19 epidemic. Additionally, during
the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, certain state and local governments enacted stay-at-home/shelter-at-home orders, causing certain agents
of the Sponsor and its third party service providers to enact business continuity measures, such as requiring or permitting employees
to work from home. 

These
factors can cause substantial market volatility, exchange trading suspensions and closures and can impact the ability of the Fund to
complete redemptions and otherwise affect Fund performance and Fund trading in the secondary market. A widespread crises may also affect
the global economy in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen at the current time. How long such events will last and whether they will
continue or recur cannot be predicted. Impacts from these events could have significant impact on the Fund s performance, resulting
in losses to your investment. 

Risk
that Current Assumptions and Expectations Could Become Outdated As a Result of Global Economic Shocks 

The
Russian Federation s invasion of Ukraine in February 2023 (the Ukraine War ), various nations, including the U.S.,
have instituted economic sanctions and other responsive measures, which have resulted in an increased level of global economic and political
uncertainty. Given the evolving nature of the Ukraine War, and the related sanctions, potential governmental actions, and economic impact,
the scope and magnitude of any such potential effects remain uncertain.

Introduction 

Dynamic
Shares Trust (the Trust is a Delaware statutory trust organized on March 8, 2019 and is currently organized into a single
series (the Fund which commenced investment operations on January 12, 2023. The Fund issues common units of beneficial
interest Shares ), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Fund. The
Shares of the Fund began trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca as of January 13, 2023. On September 12, 2024, Dynamic Shares LLC, the sponsor of the Dynamic Short
Short-Term Volatility Futures ETF WEIX or the Trust ), announced the decision to transfer the listing of the
Trust from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE Arca to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Cboe BZX ). The transfer
was completed on September 30, 2024. This decision was part of our ongoing evaluation of exchange platforms to better meet the evolving
needs of the Trust and its shareholders. No action is required by current shareholders, and the transfer is not expected to impact the
trading or liquidity of the Trust s shares. 

The
Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective, under normal circumstances, by obtaining investment exposure to an actively managed portfolio
of short positions in VIX Futures Contracts, which are based on the CBOE VIX Index. The Fund expects that the notional exposure of its
portfolio of short positions in VIX Futures Contracts will range from -0.1 to -0.5 under normal circumstances. The Fund expects to primarily
take short positions in VIX Futures Contracts by shorting near term VIX Futures Contracts and rolling the nearest month VIX Futures Contract
to the next month on a daily basis. As such, the Fund expects to have a constant one-month rolling short position in first and second
month VIX Futures Contracts under normal circumstances. 

The
Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 50,000 Shares (each such block a Creation Unit ). Only Authorized
Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from the Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is an entity that
has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Fund. Shares of the Fund are offered to Authorized Participants in Creation
Units at the Fund s NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, Shares from any Creation Unit
they create at a per-Share market price that varies depending on, among other factors, the trading price of the Shares of the Fund on
its listing exchange, the NAV and the supply of and demand for the Shares at the time of the offer. Shares from the same Creation Unit
may be offered at different times and may have different offering prices based upon the above factors. The form of Authorized Participant
Agreement and related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase
or redeem a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from the Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any underwriting
fees or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public.

The
Fund is actively managed and does not track an index. 

The
Fund s per share NAV decreased by 14.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Performance over time is also impacted
by the compounding effect of the inverse or leveraged returns. For instance, if the 30-day weighted VIX futures price was down 20 and
then up 20 , the two-day period return for a theoretical -0.5 inversed fund would be equal to a (1.1 0.9)-1 = -1 period return. As the
30-day weighted VIX futures price goes up, the fund would lock in trading losses and leave the fund with a smaller asset base. The Fund s
per share NAV increased by 3.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the Fund s per share NAV was due
in part to the increase in the 30 day weighted average VIX futures prices over the period. Performance over time is also impacted by
the compounding effect of the inverse or leveraged returns. For instance, if the 30-day weighted VIX futures price was down 20 and then
up 20 , the two-day period return for a theoretical -0.5 inversed fund would be equal to a (1.1 0.9)-1 = -1 period return. As the 30-day
weighted VIX futures price goes up, the fund would lock in trading losses and leave the fund with a smaller asset base.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

In
order to collateralize derivatives positions in indices, commodities or currencies, a portion of the NAV of the Fund is held in cash
and/or U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, or other high credit quality short term fixed-income or similar securities (such
as shares of money market funds, bank deposits, bank money market accounts, certain variable rate-demand notes and repurchase agreements
collateralized by government securities, whether denominated in U.S. dollars or the applicable foreign currency with respect to a Currency
Fund). A portion of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection with swap agreements, futures, and/or forward contracts.
The percentage that U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term fixed-income securities bear to the shareholders equity of the Fund
varies from period to period as the market values of the underlying swaps, futures contracts and forward contracts change. During the
three months ended September 30, 2024, the three months ended September 30, 2023, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund earned interest income as follows:

The
Fund s underlying futures contracts, as applicable, may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory
considerations and other reasons. For example, commodity exchanges may limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a
single day by regulations referred to as daily limits. During a single day, no futures trades may be executed at prices
beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions
in such futures contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit.
Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market
conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating its futures positions. 

The
potentially large size of the positions which the Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making the positions more
difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. Any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially
be exacerbated due to the fact that the Fund will be related to one benchmark, which may be highly concentrated. 

29 

Because
the Fund may trade futures and forward contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk)
or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). 

Market
Risk 

Trading
in derivatives contracts involves the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a volatility product underlying
the Fund s benchmark at a specified date and price, should it hold such derivative contract into the deliverable period. Should
the Fund enter into a contractual commitment to sell a physical commodity, currency or spot volatility product, it would be required
to make delivery of that commodity, currency or spot volatility product at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing
market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which the value of a commodity, currency or spot volatility product can
rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities, currencies or spot volatility products would expose a Fund to theoretically
unlimited risk. 

For
more information, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. 

Credit
Risk 

When
the Fund enters into futures contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. 

The
counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges as well as certain swaps is the clearing
house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required
to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce
this credit risk. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges, which may become
applicable in the future), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

The
Sponsor attempts to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally: 

executing
 and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor; 

limiting
 the outstanding amounts due from counterparties to the Fund; 

not
 posting margin directly with a counterparty; 

requiring
 that the counterparty posts collateral in amounts approximately equal to that owed to the
 Fund, as marked to market daily, subject to certain minimum thresholds; and 

limiting
 the amount of margin or premium posted at a FCM. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents Risk. 

At
any time, the Fund may have significant investments in cash or cash equivalents. When a substantial portion of a portfolio is held in
cash or cash equivalents, there is the risk that the value of the cash account, including interest, will not keep pace with inflation,
thus reducing purchasing power over time. 

30 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

As
of November 11, 2024, the Fund has not used, nor is it anticipated that the Fund will use such arrangements in the future, special purpose
entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements
of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related
to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Fund. While the Fund s
exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have
a material impact on the Fund s financial position. 

Management
fee payments made to the Sponsor are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Fund s NAV. As such, the Sponsor cannot anticipate
the payment amounts that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs are not known until a future date. The
agreement with the Sponsor may be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice to the other party. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Preparation
of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Trust s
and the Fund s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. 

The
Trust is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups JOBS Act of 2012.
It will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the beginning of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary
of its initial public offering, (2) the beginning of the first fiscal year after annual gross revenue is 1.07 billion (subject to adjustment
for inflation) or more, (3) the date on which the Fund has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible
debt securities and (4) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates exceeded 700
million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. 

For
as long as the Trust remains an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of certain exemptions from the various reporting
requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited
to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from
the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. The Trust will take advantage of these reporting exemptions until it is no longer an emerging
growth company. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
The Trust intends to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period. 

31 

The
Fund has significant exposure to futures contracts, all of which are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair value in the financial
statements, with changes in fair value reported in the Statements of Operations. The use of fair value to measure Financial Instruments,
with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period, is fundamental to the Trust s and the Fund s
financial statements. The fair value of a Financial Instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). 

Short-term
investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value for daily NAV purposes. For financial reporting purposes, short-term
investments are valued at their market price using information provided by a third-party pricing service or market quotations. 

Derivatives
(e.g., futures contracts, options, swap agreements, forward agreements and foreign currency forward contracts) are generally valued using
independent sources and/or agreements with counterparties or other procedures as determined by the Sponsor. Futures contracts are generally
valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that future trades. For financial reporting purposes, all futures
contracts are valued at last settled price. Futures contracts valuations are typically categorized as Level I in the fair value hierarchy.
Swap agreements, forward agreements and foreign currency forward contracts valuations are typically categorized as Level II in the fair
value hierarchy. The Sponsor may in its sole discretion choose to determine a fair value price as the basis for determining the market
value of such position. Such fair value prices would be generally determined based on available inputs about the current value of the
underlying financial instrument or commodity and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such
principles are consistent with normal industry standards. The Sponsor may fair value an asset of the Fund pursuant to the policies the
Sponsor has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. Depending on the source and relevant significance of valuation
inputs, these instruments may be classified as Level II or Level III in the fair value hierarchy. 

Fair
value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of an investment. While the Fund s policy is intended to result
in a calculation of the Fund s NAV that fairly reflects investment values as of the time of pricing, the Fund cannot ensure that
fair values determined by the Sponsor or persons acting at their direction would accurately reflect the price that the Fund could obtain
for an investment if it were to dispose of that investment as of the time of pricing (for instance, in a forced or distressed sale). 

The
prices used by the Fund may differ from the value that would be realized if the investments were sold and the differences could be material
to the financial statements. 

The
Fund discloses the fair value of their investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. 

Discounts
on short-term securities purchased are amortized and reflected as Interest Income in the Statements of Operations. 

32 

Realized
gains (losses) are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period in which
the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively. 

The
Fund pays its brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction
related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities for the Fund s investment in U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission regulated investments. Brokerage commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis.

Short
futures notional values are calculated by multiplying the number of contracts held times the valuation price times the contract multiplier.
The short notional values will increase (decrease) proportionally with decreases (increases) in the price of the futures contract. Additional
gains (losses) associated with these contracts will be equal to any such subsequent decreases (increases) in short notional values, before
accounting for spreads or transaction or financing costs. The Fund will generally attempt to adjust its position in Financial Instruments
each day to have 0.50 of short exposure to the Index for every 1.00 of net assets. Future period returns, before fees and expenses,
cannot be estimated simply by estimating the return of the Index and multiplying by negative one-half. 

The
Fund s performance for periods greater than a single day will be the result of each day s returns compounded over the period.
A single day is measured from the time a Fund calculates its net asset value to the time of the Fund s next net asset
value calculation. As a consequence, the return for investors that invest for a period different than a trading day will not be the product
of the return of the Fund s stated daily inverse investment objective. Particularly, during periods of high volatility, the Fund
may not perform as expected, and the Fund may have losses when an investor may have expected gains if the Fund is held for a period that
is different than one trading day. 

33 

Compounding
affects all investments, but has a more significant impact on an inverse fund, such as the Fund. This effect becomes more pronounced
as volatility increases. 

Qualitative
Disclosure 

The
investment objective of the Fund to seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, which correspond to a multiple, the inverse
or an inverse multiple of the daily performance, of its corresponding benchmark. The Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees
and expenses, that correspond to one-tenth the inverse (-0.1x) or the inverse (-0.5x) of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark.
The Fund does not seek to achieve these stated investment objectives over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical
compounding prevents the Fund from achieving such results. Performance over longer periods of time will be influenced not only by the
cumulative period performance of the corresponding benchmark but equally by the intervening volatility of the benchmark as well as fees
and expenses, including costs associated with the use of financial instruments such as financing costs and trading spreads. Future period
returns, before fees and expenses, cannot be estimated simply by estimating the percent change in the corresponding benchmark and multiplying
by negative three, negative two, negative one, negative one-half, one, one and one-half, two or three. Shareholders who invest in the
Fund should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. 

Equity
Market Volatility Sensitivity 

VIX
Futures Contracts are unlike traditional futures contracts and are not based on a tradable reference asset. The VIX Index is not directly
investable, and the settlement price of a VIX Futures Contract is based on the calculation that determines the level of the VIX Index.
As a result, the behavior of a VIX Futures Contract may be different from traditional futures contracts whose settlement price is based
on a specific tradable asset. In addition, when economic uncertainty increases and there is an associated increase in expected volatility,
the value of VIX Futures Contracts will likely also increase. Similarly, when economic uncertainty recedes and there is an associated
decrease in expected volatility, the value of VIX Futures Contracts will likely also decrease. When the Fund has an open futures contract
position, it is subject to daily variation margin calls that could be substantial in the event of adverse price movements. Because futures
require only a small initial investment in the form of a deposit or margin, they involve a high degree of leverage. If the Fund has insufficient
cash to meet daily variation margin requirements, it might need to sell portfolio investments at a time when such sales are disadvantageous.
Futures markets are highly volatile and the use of or exposure to futures contracts may increase volatility of the Fund s NAV.
Futures contracts are also subject to liquidity risk. 

Several
factors may affect the price and/or liquidity of VIX Futures Contracts, including, but not limited to: prevailing market prices and forward
volatility levels of the U.S. stock markets, the S P 500 , the equity securities included in the S P 500 and prevailing
market prices of options on the S P 500 , the VIX Index, options on the VIX Index, VIX Futures Contracts, or any other financial
instruments related to the S P 500 and the VIX Index or VIX Futures Contracts; interest rates, economic, financial, political,
regulatory, geographical, biological or judicial events that affect the current volatility reading of the VIX Index or the market price
or forward volatility of the U.S. stock markets, the equity securities included in the S P 500 , the S P 500 , the VIX
Index or the relevant futures or option contracts on the VIX Index; supply and demand as well as hedging activities in the listed and
over-the-counter OTC equity derivatives markets; disruptions in trading of the S P 500 , futures contracts on
the S P 500 or options on the S P 500 and the level of contango or backwardation in the VIX Futures Contracts market.
These factors interrelate in complex ways, and the effect of one factor on the market value of the Fund may offset or enhance the effect
of another factor. 

34 

In
addition, the policies of S P and the CBOE and changes that affect the composition and valuation of the S P 500 and the
VIX Index could affect the level of such indexes and/or the value of VIX Futures Contracts and, therefore, the value of the Fund s
Shares. For example, shareholders will lose money when the values of the VIX Futures Contracts rise, and a single day or intraday increase
in the level of the VIX Futures Contracts approaching 200 could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an investor s
investment Inverse Exposure Risk . 

Managing
Market Risks 

The
Fund s exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors, including the liquidity of the markets in which the financial
instruments it holds are traded and the relationships among the financial instruments held. The inherent uncertainty of the trading of
the Fund as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors 
capital. 

A
futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of
a specified quantity and type of a particular underlying asset at a specified time and place or alternatively may call for cash settlement.
Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of underlying assets, including bonds, interest rates, agricultural products, stock indexes,
currencies, energy, metals, economic indicators and statistical measures. The notional size and calendar term futures contracts on a
particular underlying asset are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of
contracts traded between the buyer and seller. The Fund generally deposits cash and/or securities with an FCM for its open positions
in futures contracts, which may, in turn, transfer such deposits to the clearing house to protect the clearing house against non-payment
by the Fund. The clearing house becomes substituted for each counterparty to a futures contract, and, in effect, guarantees performance.
In addition, the FCM may require the Fund to deposit collateral in excess of the clearing house s margin requirements for the FCM s
own protection. 

Certain
futures contracts, including VIX Futures Contracts, settle in cash. The cash settlement amount reflects the difference between the contract
purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price. The cash settlement mechanism avoids the potential for either side to have to
deliver the underlying asset. For other futures contracts, the contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied
by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying asset or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract
on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery. The difference between the price at which the futures contract
is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the
profit or loss to the trader. 

35 

Futures
contracts involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk and exposure to loss in excess of the amounts of variation margin, which
are the amounts of cash that the Fund agrees to pay to or receive from FCMs equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of a futures
contract. With futures contracts, there is minimal but some counterparty risk to the Fund since futures contracts are exchange traded
and the exchange s clearinghouse, as counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts, effectively guarantees futures contracts
against default. Many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during
a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made that day at a price beyond
that limit or trading may be suspended for specified times during the trading day. Futures contracts prices could move to the limit for
several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially
subjecting the Fund to substantial losses. If trading is not possible or if the Fund determines not to close a futures position in anticipation
of adverse price movements, the Fund may be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.
