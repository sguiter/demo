 ; however, we do own some leased assets through joint ventures with other partners that share our view that healthcare facilities are part of the infrastructure of any community, which we refer to as investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. We also may make mortgage loans to healthcare operators collateralized by their real estate. In addition, we may make noncontrolling investments in our tenants (which we refer to as investments in unconsolidated operating entities), from time-to-time, typically in conjunction with larger real estate transactions with the tenant, which may enhance our overall return and provide for certain minority rights and protections. Our business model facilitates acquisitions and recapitalizations, and allows operators of healthcare facilities to unlock the value of their real estate to fund facility improvements, technology upgrades, and other investments in operations. At September 30, 2024 , we have investments in facilities in states in the U.S., in countries in Europe, and country in South America. Our properties consist of general acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities, post acute care facilities (including inpatient physical rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals), and freestanding ER/urgent care facilities. We manage our business as a single business segment.

2024 Activity Utah Transaction On April 12, 2024, we sold our interests in Utah hospitals for an aggregate agreed valuation of approximately billion to a newly formed joint venture (the "Utah partnership") with an institutional asset manager (the "Fund"), which we call the Utah Transaction, and we recognized a gain on real estate of approximately million, partially offset by a million write-off of unbilled straight-line rent receivables. We retained an approximately interest in the Utah partnership valued initially at approximately million, which is being accounted for on the equity method on a quarterly lag basis and included in the "Investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" line of the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Fund purchased an approximate interest for million. In conjunction with this transaction closing, the Utah partnership placed new non-recourse secured financing, providing million of additional cash to us. In total, the Utah Transaction generated billion of cash to us. The Utah lessee (an affiliate of CommonSpirit Health ("CommonSpirit")) may acquire the leased real estate at a price equal to the greater of fair market value and the approximate billion lease base at the fifth or tenth anniversary of the 2023 master lease commencement. We granted the Fund certain limited and conditional preferences based on the possible execution of the purchase option, which we accounted for as a derivative liability with an initial value of approximately million. 2023 Activity Prospect Transaction In August 2019, we invested in a portfolio of acute care hospitals in three states (California, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut) operated by and master leased to or mortgaged by Prospect Medical Holdings, Inc. ("Prospect") for a combined investment of approximately billion. In addition, we originated a million term loan cross-defaulted to the master lease and mortgage loan agreements and further secured by a parent guaranty. In the 2022 second quarter, we funded an additional million towards the existing mortgage loan that was secured by a first lien on a California hospital. Prospect's operations were negatively impacted by the coronavirus global pandemic commencing in early 2020, but Prospect remained current with respect to contractual rent and interest payments until the fourth quarter of 2022. Accordingly, and due further to the termination of certain refinancing negotiations

million impairment charge in the 2022 fourth quarter. As part of this charge, we reduced the carrying value of the underperforming Pennsylvania properties by approximately million (to approximately million) and reserved all unbilled rent accruals for a total of million. However, Prospect continued to pursue a recapitalization plan, and, in late March 2023, Prospect received a binding commitment from several lenders to provide liquidity to pay down certain debt instruments. Along with these commitments from third-party lenders, we agreed to pursue certain transactions with Prospect as part of their recapitalization plan, including originating a million convertible loan to PHP Holdings, the managed care business of Prospect, in the first quarter of 2023. On May 23, 2023, Prospect completed its recapitalization plan, which included receiving million in new financing from several lenders. Along with this new debt capital from third-party lenders, we agreed to the following restructuring of our then billion investment in Prospect including: a) maintaining the master lease covering six California hospitals without any changes in rental rates or escalator provisions, but with cash payments starting in September 2023 for a substantial portion of the contractual monthly rent due on these California properties, b) transitioning the Pennsylvania properties back to Prospect in return for a million first lien mortgage on the facilities, c) providing up to million in a loan secured by a first lien on Prospect's accounts receivable and certain other assets, of which we funded in full during 2023, d) continuing to pursue the sale of the three Connecticut properties to Yale New Haven ("Yale"), as more fully described in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, and e) obtaining a non-controlling ownership interest in PHP Holdings of approximately million consisting of an approximate million equity investment and million loan convertible into equity of PHP Holdings (collectively, the "Prospect Transaction"). This non-controlling ownership interest was received in exchange for unpaid rent and interest through December 2022, previously unrecorded rent and interest revenue in 2023 totaling approximately million, our million mortgage loan on a California property, our million term loan, and other obligations at the time of such investment. Lifepoint Transaction On February 7, 2023, a subsidiary of Lifepoint Health, Inc. ("Lifepoint") acquired a majority interest in Springstone (now Lifepoint Behavioral Health, "Lifepoint Behavioral") (the "Lifepoint Transaction") based on an enterprise value of million. As part of the transaction, we received approximately million in full satisfaction of our initial acquisition loan, including accrued interest, and we retained our minority equity investment in the operations of Lifepoint Behavioral. Separately, we converted a mortgage loan (as part of our initial acquisition in 2021) into the fee simple ownership of a property in Washington, which is leased, along with other behavioral health hospitals, to Lifepoint Behavioral, under a master lease agreement. In connection with the Lifepoint Transaction, Lifepoint extended its lease on existing general acute care hospitals by to . In the first quarter of 2024, we sold our minority equity investment in Lifepoint Behavioral for approximately million. Other Transactions In the second quarter of 2023, we acquired inpatient rehabilitation facilities for a total of approximately million (approximately million). These hospitals are leased to Median Kliniken S. .r.l ("MEDIAN") pursuant to a long-term master lease with annual inflation-based escalators. On April 14, 2023, we acquired behavioral health hospitals located in the U.K. for approximately million (approximately million). These hospitals are leased to Priory Group ("Priory") pursuant to separate lease agreements with annual inflation-based escalators. Development Activities 

IMED (Spain) 

We have other development projects ongoing in Texas (Texarkana development) and Massachusetts (Norwood redevelopment). These are not highlighted above; however, on a combined basis, we have spent approximately million through September 30, 2024.

million additional recovery in the 2024 third quarter. 2024 Activity During the first quarter of 2024, we completed construction and began recording rental income on a million behavioral health facility located in McKinney, Texas, that is leased to Lifepoint Behavioral. We also completed construction and began recording rental income on a million (approximately million) general acute care facility located in Spain that is leased to IMED. 2023 Activity During the first nine months of 2023, we completed construction and began recording rental income on one inpatient rehabilitation facility located in Lexington, South Carolina, which commenced rent on July 1, 2023, and another inpatient rehabilitation facility located in Stockton, California, which commenced rent on May 1, 2023. Both of these facilities are leased to Ernest Health, Inc. ("Ernest") pursuant to an existing long-term master lease. Disposals 2024 Activity During the first nine months of 2024, we had the following disposal activities: See Utah Transaction above for a discussion of the five Utah hospitals sold on April 12, 2024. 

 On April 9, 2024, we sold properties to Prime Healthcare Services, Inc. ("Prime") for total proceeds of approximately million along with a million interest-bearing mortgage loan (which was fully repaid on August 29, 2024). This transaction resulted in a gain on real estate of approximately million, partially offset by a non-cash straight-line rent write-off of approximately million. As part of this sale transaction, we extended the lease maturity of four other facilities with Prime to 2044. This amended lease has inflation-based escalators, collared between and , and a purchase option on or prior to August 26, 2028 for a value of million, which is greater than our net book value for these properties at September 30, 2024. After August 26, 2028, this option price reverts to million (subject to annual escalations). 

 On July 23, 2024, we sold the -bed Arizona General Hospital in Mesa, Arizona and freestanding emergency departments to Dignity Health ("Dignity") for million. This sale resulted in a gain on real estate of approximately million, partially offset by a non-cash straight-line rent write-off of approximately million. 

 On August 14, 2024, we sold freestanding emergency departments to UCHealth for million. This sale resulted in a gain on real estate of approximately million, partially offset by a non-cash straight-line rent write-off of approximately million. 

 As a result of the Company s global settlement with Steward Health Care System ("Steward") approved by the bankruptcy court on September 18, 2024 (as discussed further under "Leasing Operations (Lessor)" under this same Note 3 ), we agreed to sell facilities located in Florida ("Space Coast" properties) to Orlando Health. As such, we designated these properties as held for sale at September 30, 2024 and adjusted the value of our investment, after considering the provisions of the settlement agreement, to million, equal to fair value less cost to sell. 

 In the third quarter of 2024, Pajaro Valley Healthcare District Corporation notified us of their intent to exercise their purchase option on the Watsonville facility. As such, we designated this property as held for sale at September 30, 2024 under a sales-type lease. This transaction, which closed on October 31, 2024, resulted in an approximate million gain in the third quarter of 2024. 

 During the first nine months of 2024, we also completed the sale of other facilities and ancillary facilities for approximately million, resulting in a loss on real estate of approximately million.

2023 Activity On March 30, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our general acute care facilities located in Australia and operated by Healthscope Ltd. ("Healthscope") (the "Australia Transaction") to affiliates of HMC Capital for cash proceeds of approximately A billion. As a result, we designated the Australian portfolio as held for sale in the first quarter of 2023 and recorded approximately million of net impairment charges at that time, which included million of straight-line rent receivable write-offs and approximately million in fees to sell the hospitals, partially offset by approximately million of gains from our interest rate swap and foreign currency translation amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income that were reclassified to earnings in 2023 as part of the transaction. This transaction closed in two phases. The first phase closed on May 18, 2023, in which we sold of the facilities for A million, and the final phase closed on October 10, 2023, in which we sold the remaining facilities for approximately A million. On March 8, 2023, we received notice that Prime planned to exercise its right to repurchase from us the real estate associated with one master lease for approximately million. As such, we recorded an approximate million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2023 related to non-cash rent receivables on the facilities that were sold on July 11, 2023. Leasing Operations (Lessor) We acquire and develop healthcare facilities and lease the facilities to healthcare operating companies. The initial fixed lease terms of these infrastructure-type assets are typically at least years, and most include renewal options at the election of our tenants, generally in increments. Over of our leases provide annual rent escalations based on increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") (or similar indices outside the U.S.) and/or fixed minimum annual rent escalations. Many of our domestic leases contain purchase options with pricing set at various terms but in no case less than our total initial investment. Our leases typically require the tenant to handle and bear most of the costs associated with our properties including repair/maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. For all of our properties subject to lease, we are the legal owner of the property and the tenant's right to use and possess such property is guided by the terms of a lease. At September 30, 2024 , we account for all of these leases as operating leases, except where GAAP requires alternative classification, including leases on Ernest facilities that are accounted for as direct financing leases and

Other Leasing Activities At September 30, 2024 , our vacant properties represent less than of total assets. We are in various stages of either re-leasing or selling these vacant properties. Our tenants financial performance and resulting ability to satisfy their lease and loan obligations to us are material to our financial results and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to our stockholders. Our tenants operate in the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated, and changes in regulation (or delays in enacting regulation) may temporarily impact our tenants operations until they are able to make the appropriate adjustments to their business. In addition, our tenants may experience operational challenges from time-to-time as a result of many factors, including those external to them, such as cybersecurity attacks or public health crises (like the COVID-19 pandemic), economic issues resulting in high inflation and spikes in labor costs, extreme or severe weather and climate-related events, and adverse market and political conditions. We monitor our tenants' operating results and the potential impact from these challenges. We may elect to provide support to our tenants from time-to-time in the form of short-term rent deferrals to be paid back in full (like as described below under Pipeline Health System), or in the form of temporary loans (like as described previously in the Prospect Transaction). See below for an update on some of our tenants: Steward Health Care System As discussed in previous filings, Steward has experienced significant operational and liquidity challenges and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 6, 2024 with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. On September 11, 2024, the bankruptcy court entered an interim order approving a global settlement between Steward, its lenders, the unsecured creditors committee, and the Company. The interim order was made final by the bankruptcy court on September 18, 2024. The order provided for the following: a) termination of our master lease with Steward; b) the release of claims against of our properties, allowing us to begin the process of re-tenanting or selling these properties; and c) a full release of claims against us from all parties. In return, we agreed to provide million to the Steward estate from the proceeds of the sale of the Space Coast properties along with a full release of our claims in Steward including claims to past due rent and interest, outstanding loans, and our equity investment. With this global settlement, our relationship with Steward effectively ends with no remaining Steward exposure on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024, other than from the re-tenanting or selling of formerly leased Steward properties that are currently not under lease. In regard to our real estate partnership with Macquarie Asset Management Macquarie ), the bankruptcy court approved the termination of the partnership s master lease with Steward during the 2024 third quarter. In addition, we and Macquarie entered into an agreement with the mortgage lender of the partnership to transition the eight Massachusetts properties to them along with cash proceeds of approximately million (representing our share), in return for full payment of the underlying mortgage debt and a release of claims against each party.

(1) million of this charge was recorded in the "Earnings (loss) from equity interests" line of our condensed consolidated statements of net income. 

In addition with the lease termination discussed above, we accelerated the amortization on the related in-place lease intangibles resulting in million and million of amortization expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as reflected in the real estate depreciation and amortization line of our condensed consolidated statements of net income. Re-tenanting Activity Subsequent to the release of claims on the properties as part of the global settlement, we reached definitive agreements with operators (Healthcare Systems of America, Honor Health, Insight Health, Quorum Health, and College Health) to lease of these facilities during and shortly after the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Excluding the two developments, the remaining properties (with a net book value of less than of our total assets) are in various stages of being re-tenanted or sold. Other Activity During 2024, we received and recorded rent and interest revenue from Steward of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In addition, we were benefited from rent paid by Steward to the Massachusetts partnership of million million representing our share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the sale of the Space Coast properties to Orlando Health was completed, and the Steward bankruptcy estate retained million of the approximately million total proceeds as discussed above. Prospect We lease real estate assets to Prospect in California and Connecticut and have a mortgage loan secured by four properties in Pennsylvania. Our total real estate investment is approximately billion at September 30, 2024. Starting January 1, 2023, we began accounting for our leases and loans to Prospect on a cash basis versus our normal accrual method. In the first nine months of 2024, we recognized approximately million of revenue representing cash received for rents on our California properties. In addition, we received and recorded approximately million of interest on the asset-backed loan in 2024. However, Prospect did not make any scheduled rent or interest payments in the 2024 third quarter, resulting in no revenue recorded in the period. Although we believe our remaining real estate and asset-backed loan investments are recoverable at September 30, 2024, no assurances can be given that a future impairment will not be needed, particularly if Prospect's east coast operations do not improve or are not sold timely and they continue to miss scheduled rent and interest payments. In regard to PHP Holdings, we account for our investment (both the equity investment and convertible loan) using the fair value option method. Prospect and its investment bankers continued to work through the sale process during and subsequent to the end of the period, resulting in a binding agreement with Astrana Health on November 8, 2024, as further described in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Based on our consideration of information in the purchase agreement, along with consultations with our third party appraisers, we recorded an additional approximate million unfavorable fair value adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 (total unfavorable fair value adjustment in 2024 of million), resulting in a total investment in PHP Holdings of approximately million at September 30, 2024. Each quarter, we mark such investment to fair value as more fully described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

million, or approximately , of rent in 2023 to be paid in 2024 with interest. As of September 30, 2024, Pipeline is current on their monthly base rent obligations per the terms of the lease, and we hold a rent deposit that more than covers the remaining million of unpaid deferred rent. International Joint Venture As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2023, we placed our loan to the international joint venture on the cash basis of accounting, as we determined that it was no longer probable that the borrower would pay its future interest in full. This loan, accounted for under the fair value option method, was collateralized by the equity of Steward held by an investor in both Steward and the international joint venture. Consistent with the discussion above on non-real estate investments in Steward, we recorded a million unfavorable fair value adjustment in the 2024 first quarter to fully reserve for the loan and related equity investment. These investments, which are included in Investments in unconsolidated operating entities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, were adjusted for after comparing our carrying value to an updated fair value analysis of the underlying collateral, with assistance from a third-party, independent valuation firm. CommonSpirit On May 1, 2023, Catholic Health Initiatives Colorado ("CHIC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CommonSpirit, acquired the Utah hospital operations of general acute care facilities previously operated by Steward. As a result of this transaction, we received million on May 1, 2023, of the million loan made in the 2022 second quarter. The new lease, at the time, for these Utah assets had an initial fixed term of years with annual escalation provisions. As part of this transaction, we severed these facilities from the master lease with Steward, and accordingly accelerated the amortization of the associated in-place lease intangibles (approximately million) and wrote-off approximately million of straight-line rent receivables. As described earlier, these five properties make up the Utah Transaction. Other Tenant Matters In the 2023 third quarter, we moved to the cash basis of accounting for a tenant that comprised approximately of our total assets due to declines in operating results. As a result, we recorded a million charge to reserve billed and straight-line rent receivables. During the 2024 third quarter, we terminated the lease with this tenant, resulting in the acceleration of lease intangible amortization of million. The former tenant is currently working on raising external capital, independent of us. In addition, we are currently working with the former tenant on an agreement that could result in either the sale and/or re-leasing of these real estate assets in early 2025. At September 2024, we believe the net book value of the related assets are recoverable. However, no assurances can be given that a future impairment will not be needed. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures Our primary business strategy is to acquire real estate and lease to providers of healthcare services. Typically, we directly own of such investments. However, from time-to-time, we will co-invest with other investors that share a similar view that hospital real estate is a necessary infrastructure-type asset in communities. In these types of investments, we will own undivided interests of less than of the real estate through unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. The underlying real estate and leases in these

Total 

The decrease in our total investment in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures since December 31, 2023, is primarily due to the impairment recorded to our Massachusetts-based partnership with Macquarie in the second quarter of 2024 as more fully described above in this same Note 3 . In the third quarter of 2024, we and the other equity owners funded capital contributions (our share being approximately million) to the Swiss Medical Network investment, proceeds of which were used to pay off debt inside the joint venture. As discussed previously, we hold a interest in the Utah partnership accounted for under the equity method. The Utah partnership elected to apply specialized accounting and reporting for investment companies under Topic 946, which measures the underlying investments at fair value. For the quarter ending September 30, 2024, our share of the Utah partnership's favorable fair value adjustment was approximately million, primarily related to the underlying real estate. Investments in Unconsolidated Operating Entities Our investments in unconsolidated operating entities are noncontrolling investments that are typically made in conjunction with larger real estate transactions in which the operators are vetted as part of our overall underwriting process. In many cases, we would not be able to acquire the larger real estate portfolio without such investments in operators. These investments also offer the opportunity to enhance our overall return and provide for certain minority rights and protections.

See "Leasing Operations (Lessor)" under this same Note 3 for details on the change in the first nine months of 2024 related to Steward. For our investments marked to fair value (including our investments in PHP Holdings, Aevis, Caremax, and the international joint venture), we recorded approximately million in unfavorable non-cash fair value adjustments during the first nine months of 2024; whereas, this was a million favorable non-cash fair value adjustment for the same period of 2023. The amount recorded in 2024 includes an approximate million unfavorable fair market value adjustment to our investment in PHP Holdings, as further described in the "Prospect" subheading of this Note 3 (included in the "Other (including fair value adjustments on securities)" line of the condensed consolidated statements of net income) and million unfavorable fair value adjustment in the 2024 first quarter

million (approximately million), resulting in an approximate million million) economic loss. In addition, we sold our remaining minority equity investment in Lifepoint Behavioral in the 2024 first quarter. Other Investment Activities In the third quarter of 2023, we invested approximately million for a participation in Steward's syndicated asset-backed credit facility, and we loaned an additional million. On August 17, 2023, we sold the million interest to a global asset manager for approximately million, and Steward paid approximately million on November 3, 2023. The remainder was written off as part of the million loan impairment charge in the 2024 third quarter as discussed in the "Leasing Operations (Lessor)" section of this same Note 3 . In the second quarter of 2023, we received repayment of the CHF million mortgage loan from Infracore SA ("Infracore") that was originally made in the fourth quarter of 2022. Credit Loss Reserves We apply a forward-looking "expected loss" model to all of our financing receivables, including financing leases and loans, based on historical credit losses of similar instruments.

Credit Facilities On April 12, 2024, we amended our unsecured credit facility (the "Credit Facility") and certain other agreements to (i) reduce revolving commitments from billion to billion, (ii) apply certain proceeds from the Utah Transaction and other asset sales and debt transactions to repay the Australian term loan facility and certain other outstanding obligations, including revolving loans under the Credit Facility to the extent necessary to reduce the outstanding borrowings to no more than the amended billion commitment, (iii) amend or waive certain covenants as described under "Covenants" in this same Note 4 , and (iv) waive the cap on unencumbered asset value attributable to tenants subject to a bankruptcy event for purposes of determining compliance with the unsecured leverage ratio for the trailing four fiscal quarter periods ended June 30, 2024, and for purposes of determining pro forma compliance with the unsecured leverage ratio for certain asset sale and debt transactions. On August 6, 2024, we amended the Credit Facility and the British pound sterling term loan due 2025 to (i) further reduce revolving commitments in the Credit Facility from billion to billion, (ii) increase borrowing spreads to basis points during the Modified Covenant Period (defined in "Covenants" section in this same Note 4 and then to basis points after the Modified Covenant Period, (iii) require that proceeds of certain future asset sales and debt transactions (during the Modified Covenant Period) be applied to repay certain outstanding obligations, including our revolving loans (by of such proceeds but for which the revolving loans can be reborrowed) and our British pound sterling term loan due (by of such proceeds), and (iv) amend or waive certain covenants as described under "Covenants" in this same Note 4 .

of the Australia facilities for A million. We used the proceeds from the first phase of this sale to prepay A million (approximately million) of the A billion Australian term loan. On April 18, 2024, we paid off and terminated the remainder of the A million (approximately million) Australian term loan facility with proceeds from the Utah Transaction described in Note 3 . British Pound Sterling Secured Term Loan due 2034 On May 24, 2024, we closed on a secured loan facility with a consortium of institutional investors that provides for a term loan in aggregate principal amount of approximately million (approximately million) secured by a portfolio of properties located in the U.K. currently leased to affiliates of Circle. The facility carries a fixed rate of over its term, excluding fees and expenses, and is interest-only (payable quarterly in advance) through the maturity date. The facility is secured by first priority mortgages or similar security instruments on the relevant properties, including assignments of rents and security over accounts, and is non-recourse to us. We used the majority of the net proceeds of the facility to pay down portions of our revolving credit facility and British pound sterling term loan due , and to pay off our British pound sterling secured term loan due (approximately million). British Pound Sterling Term Loan due 2025 In addition to the million pay down from proceeds of the secured term loan discussed above, we paid down another million of our British pound sterling term loan due in the 2024 third quarter. Debt Refinancing and Unutilized Financing Costs 2024 Activity In the first nine months of 2024, we incurred million of debt refinancing and unutilized financing costs. These costs were incurred primarily as a result of the reduction in revolving commitments under our Credit Facility and partial paydown of our British pound sterling term loan due 2025. 2023 Activity As a result of the prepayment of a portion of the Australian term loan, we incurred approximately million to accelerate the amortization of related debt issue costs in the first nine months of 2023. This charge was more than offset by the million gain realized on the purchase of approximately million of our Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023 at a discount in the 2023 third quarter. Covenants Our debt facilities impose certain restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to: incur debts; create or incur liens; provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other entity; make redemptions and repurchases of our capital stock; prepay, redeem, or repurchase debt; engage in mergers or consolidations; enter into affiliated transactions; dispose of real estate or other assets; and change our business. In addition, the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility limit the amount of dividends we can pay as a percentage of normalized adjusted funds from operations NAFFO ), as defined in the agreement, on a rolling four quarter basis to of NAFFO. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit the amount of dividends we can pay based on the sum of of NAFFO, proceeds of equity issuances, and certain other net cash proceeds. Finally, our senior unsecured notes require us to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the related indenture) of not less than of our unsecured indebtedness. In addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio (which was amended on April 12, 2024 to lower the maximum permitted ratio from to ), consolidated adjusted net worth, unsecured leverage ratio, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations, and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Credit Facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. On August 6, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility and the British pound sterling term loan due 2025 (the Amendments to increase the maximum total leverage ratio covenant from to and the maximum unsecured leverage ratio covenant from to and to decrease the minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio from :1.00 to :1.00. These Amendments were effective as of June 30, 2024 and will continue in effect through and including September 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated by us (the Modified Covenant Period at which point the credit agreement provides that covenants will automatically reset to their prior levels. In addition, the Amendments permanently reduced the minimum consolidated adjusted net worth covenant from approximately billion to billion, in each case plus the sum of certain equity proceeds. The Amendments also limit the 

 29 

per share in any fiscal quarter, but the Amendments do not provide any additional restrictions on the payment of dividends outside of the Modified Covenant Period. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants. However, as of September 30, 2024, we would not have been in compliance with certain covenants without the Amendments discussed above. Our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants, including the reset leverage and interest coverage requirements, after the end of the Modified Covenant Period depends primarily on reducing debt through asset sales, retention of cash generated from our monthly rent and interest receipts, extending maturities of certain debt instruments, and other access to capital. We expect to continue to comply with these covenants, but if we are not in compliance, including following the expiration of the Modified Covenant Period, we would have to seek additional amendments to our covenants. However, no assurances can be made that such amendments will be approved by our lenders. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Credit Facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable which could have a material adverse impact to the Company. 

 million in the 2024 second quarter. 2023 Activity During the 2023 second quarter, we elected to move a majority of our U.K. assets into a U.K. REIT regime with an effective date of July 1, 2023. With this election, we adjusted the deferred tax liabilities associated with these properties, resulting in a million income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2023. As a result of the Australia Transaction described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we recorded a million tax benefit in the first quarter of 2023. 

 million shares of common stock for awards, of which million shares remain available for future stock awards as of September 30, 2024 . Share-based compensation expense totaled million (including million related to certain grants in 2024 with cash-settlement features) and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Our equity investment and related loan to the international joint venture, our loan investment in the real estate of hospitals operated by subsidiaries of the international joint venture in Colombia, our equity investment in Lifepoint Behavioral (which was sold in March 2024), and our investment in PHP Holdings are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as we elected to account for these investments using the fair value option at the point of initial investment. We elected to account for these investments at fair value due to the size of the investments and because we believed this method was more reflective of current values. 

Mortgage loans 

Equity investment and other loans 

Investments in unconsolidated operating entities/Other loans 

Our loans to the international joint venture and its subsidiaries are recorded at fair value based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs by discounting the estimated future contractual cash flows using a credit-adjusted rate of return, which is derived from market rates of return on similar loans with similar credit quality and remaining maturity. Our equity investment in Lifepoint Behavioral (which was sold in March 2024) was recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2023, based on Level 2 inputs by discounting the estimated cash flows expected to be realized as part of the Lifepoint Transaction described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Our equity investment in the international joint venture and our investment in PHP Holdings are recorded at fair value based on Level 3 inputs, by using a market approach (for our equity investment in the international joint venture) and a discounted cash flow model and guideline public company model, a form of market approach, (for our investment in PHP Holdings), which requires significant estimates of our investee such as projected revenue and expenses and appropriate consideration of the underlying risk profile of the forecasted assumptions associated with the investee. We classify our valuations of these investments as Level 3, as we use certain unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuations require management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. For the cash flow and market approach models used for our investment in PHP Holdings, our unobservable inputs include use of a discount rate (which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital), selected revenue and EBITDA multiples in reference to guideline public companies, and an adjustment for a marketability discount ("DLOM"). In regard to the underlying projections used in the discounted cash flow model, such projections are provided by the investees. However, we may modify such projections as needed based on our review and analysis of historical results, meetings with key members of management, and our understanding of trends and developments within the healthcare industry. In the first nine months of 2024, we recorded a net unfavorable adjustment to the investments accounted for under the fair value option method of approximately million, primarily related to the loan to the international joint venture and our investment in PHP Holdings as further discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In the first nine months of 2023, we had a net favorable adjustment of approximately million for our investments accounted for under the fair value option method. The discount rate and DLOM on our investment in PHP Holdings was approximately and , respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared to and at December 31, 2023. The selected revenue multiples ranged from 0.60x to 0.70x at September

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis In addition to items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we have assets and liabilities that are measured, from time-to-time, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as for impairment purposes of our real estate, financial instruments, and for certain equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. Impairment and Fair Value Adjustments of Non-Real Estate Investments Prior to the global settlement in September 2024 (as described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) in which our claims were released, our non-real estate investments in Steward and related affiliates included our equity investment, working capital and other secured loans, and a loan made to a Steward affiliate in 2021, proceeds of which were used to redeem a similarly sized convertible loan held by Steward s former private equity sponsor. In addition, the loan to the international joint venture is collateralized by the equity of Steward held by an investor in both Steward and the international joint venture. To assess recovery of these investments, we performed a valuation of Steward s business at March 31, 2024, with assistance from a third-party, independent valuation firm. The valuation approaches utilized included the cost, market, and income approaches. The fair value analysis was performed under a non-going concern, orderly liquidation premise of value and assuming normal exposure to market participants. We utilized this premise of value due to Steward s ongoing financial distress and subsequent filing of bankruptcy. Accordingly, the valuation approaches used, including the Level 3 inputs, were based on the financial performance of the Steward assets. For profitable hospitals, Level 3 inputs included a weighted average EBITDA multiple of 6.48x from a selected range of 5x to 7x in reference to comparable transactions. We also used a weighted average discount rate of from a selected range of to . For unprofitable hospitals, Level 3 inputs included a weighted average net revenue multiple range of 0.275x from a selected range of 0.25x to 0.30x in reference to comparable transactions. We also considered the reported book values inclusive of various adjustments for unprofitable hospitals. After reducing the derived fair value of Steward's business for Steward's secured debt (including our working capital and other secured loans) and their working capital deficit, we arrived at only a nominal remaining value that could not support the carrying value of the loan to a Steward affiliate from 2021 or our remaining equity investment. In addition, the value of the investor's share of the remaining of Steward's equity that collateralized the loan to the international joint venture was deemed insufficient to support recovery of this investment. As a result, we recorded impairment charges and negative fair value adjustments in the 2024 first quarter of more than million, as discussed further in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. We updated our fair value analysis of Steward's business at June 30, 2024, using a similar approach as done in the 2024 first quarter resulting in no further impairments or fair value adjustments to non-real estate investments in the 2024 second quarter. In the third quarter of 2024, as a result of the Company s global settlement with Steward (as discussed further in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), the Company recorded impairment charges of approximately million for the working capital loans and other secured loans previously advanced to Steward. Impairment of Real Estate Investments In the 2024 third quarter, we recognized a real estate impairment charge of approximately million related to the Space Coast facilities and certain excess properties previously leased to Steward that were deemed held for sale at September 30, 2024. The charge was needed to adjust our net book value to align with fair value less cost to sell based on expected proceeds, including from a binding agreement for the Space Coast properties. In the 2024 second quarter, we recognized approximately million of real

to ). Our share of the real estate impairment charge in the Macquarie partnership exceeded the remaining equity amount in the joint venture, which resulted in a write down of our equity interest to and such charge is reflected in the "Earnings (loss) from equity interests" line on the condensed consolidated statements of net income.

Prospect facilities located in Connecticut to Yale for approximately million, of which we are still contractually owed million in cash and have previously received the remainder in additional investments in PHP Holdings - part of the Prospect Transaction discussed in Note 3 . This transaction was approved by the state of Connecticut's Office of Health Strategy on March 27, 2024 and is now subject to the completion of Yale's acquisition of the hospital operations from Prospect. However, given the length of time since the definitive agreements were signed, no assurances can be given that this transaction will be consummated as described or at all. Our net book value for these three facilities is slightly less than of our total assets at September 30, 2024. Contingencies As part of the global settlement with Steward discussed in Note 3 , upon completion of the transfers to the new operators and satisfaction of certain other conditions, in addition to approval by relevant state and local regulators, each of the Company and Steward have agreed, subject to specified exceptions, to the mutual release of claims against each other, including payment by Steward of any accrued or future rent under its master leases with the Company and accrued or future payments of principal and interest on outstanding loans from the Company. Steward s asset backed lenders also forfeited their right to cause the Company to purchase up to million of bridge loans made to Steward during the first quarter of 2024. In connection with the global settlement with Steward and reciprocal release of claims, the Company has an approximate million liability at September 30, 2024, for property taxes, other property related expenses, and other obligations due to third parties. We are party to various lawsuits as described below: Securities and Derivative Litigation On April 13, 2023, we and certain of our executives were named as defendants in a putative federal securities class action lawsuit alleging false and/or misleading statements and/or omissions resulted in artificially inflated prices for our common stock, filed by a purported stockholder in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (Case No. 2:23-cv-00486). The complaint seeks class certification on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between July 15, 2019 and February 22, 2023 and unspecified damages including interest and an award of reasonable costs and expenses. This class action complaint was amended on September 22, 2023 and alleges that we made material misstatements or omissions relating to the financial health of certain of our tenants. On September 26, 2024, the Court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. On October 24, 2024, the plaintiff moved to alter the Court s judgment and for leave to further amend the complaint. On November 11, 2024, the Company filed an opposition to plaintiff's motion.

facilities located in Texas and previously leased for total proceeds of approximately million. On November 8, 2024, Astrana Health entered into a binding agreement to purchase the majority of PHP Holdings for approximately million and the assumption of certain liabilities. After satisfaction of certain obligations, we expect to receive approximately million in total proceeds. We expect to receive the majority of these proceeds in the first half of 2025, while a million payment is expected by 2027.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations are presented on a combined basis for Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. as there are no material differences between these two entities. Such discussion and analysis should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Forward-Looking Statements. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "may", "will", "would", "could", "expect", "intend", "plan", "estimate", "target", "anticipate", "believe", "objectives", "outlook", "guidance", or other similar words, and include statements regarding our strategies, objectives, asset sales and other liquidity transactions (including the use of proceeds thereof), expected returns on investments and financial performance, expected trends and performance across our various markets, and expected outcomes from Steward's restructuring process. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results or future performance, achievements or transactions or events to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and as updated in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods, and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Such factors include, among others, the following: 
 the risk that property sales, loan repayments, and other capital recycling transactions do not occur as anticipated or at all, including the transactions described in Note 9 and Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements; 

the risk that we are not able to attain our leverage, liquidity, and cost of capital objectives within a reasonable time period or at all; 

our ability to obtain debt financing on attractive terms or at all, as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors, which may adversely impact our ability to pay down, refinance, restructure, or extend our indebtedness as it becomes due, or pursue acquisition and development opportunities; 

our ability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants under our debt facilities and obtain additional debt covenant relief under our Credit Facility; 

macroeconomic conditions, including due to geopolitical conditions and instability, which may lead to a disruption of or lack of access to the capital markets, disruptions and instability in the banking and financial services industries, rising inflation and movements in currency exchange rates, and may negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants; 

the risk that the expected sale of three Connecticut hospitals currently leased to Prospect does not occur on the agreed upon terms or at all, and that we are otherwise unable to monetize our investment in PHP at current value within a reasonable time period or at all; 

any downgrades in our credit ratings; 

the ability of our tenants, operators, and borrowers (including those of our joint ventures) to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with us; 

the ability of our tenants and operators to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow, comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations in the operation of our properties, to deliver high-quality services, to attract and retain qualified personnel, and to attract patients; 

the cooperation of our joint venture partners, including adverse developments affecting the financial health of such joint venture partners or the joint venture itself; 

the economic, political and social impact of, and uncertainty relating to, the potential impact from health crises (like COVID-19), which may adversely affect our and our tenants business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity; 

our success in implementing our business strategy and our ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate, and integrate acquisitions and investments; 

the nature and extent of our current and future competition; 

factors affecting the real estate industry generally or the healthcare real estate industry in particular; 

36 

our ability to maintain our status as a REIT for income tax purposes in the U.S. and U.K.; 

changes in federal, state, or local tax laws in the U.S., Europe, South America, or other jurisdictions in which we may own healthcare facilities or transact business; 

federal and state healthcare and other regulatory requirements, as well as those in the foreign jurisdictions where we own properties; 

the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain equity or debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; 

loss of property owned through ground leases upon breach or termination of the ground leases; 

potential environmental contingencies and other liabilities; 

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 

the risks and uncertainties of litigation or other regulatory proceedings and investigations; and 

the accuracy of our methodologies and estimates regarding environmental, social, and governance ESG metrics and targets, tenant willingness and ability to collaborate towards reporting ESG metrics and meeting ESG goals and targets, and the impact of governmental regulation on our and our tenants ESG efforts. 

Key Factors that May Affect Our Operations 
 Our revenue is derived from rents we earn pursuant to the lease agreements with our tenants, from interest income from loans to our tenants and other facility owners, and from profits or equity interests in certain of our tenants operations. Our tenants operate in the healthcare industry, generally providing medical, surgical, rehabilitative, and behavioral health care to patients. The capacity of our tenants to pay our rents and interest is dependent upon their ability to conduct their operations at profitable levels. We believe that the business environment of the industry segments in which our tenants operate is generally positive for efficient operators. However, our tenants operations are subject to economic, regulatory, market, and other conditions (such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic) that may affect their profitability, which could impact our results. Accordingly, we monitor certain key performance indicators that we believe provide us with early indications of conditions that could affect the level of risk in our portfolio. 
 Key factors that we may consider in underwriting prospective deals and in our ongoing monitoring of our tenants (and guarantors performance, as well as the condition of our properties, include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the scope and breadth of clinical services and programs, including utilization trends (both inpatient and outpatient) by service type; 

the size and composition of medical staff and physician leadership at our facilities, including specialty, tenure, and number of procedures performed and/or referrals; 

an evaluation of our operators administrative team, as applicable, including background and tenure within the healthcare industry; 

staffing trends, including ratios, turnover metrics, recruitment and retention strategies at corporate and individual facility levels; 

facility operating performance measured by current, historical, and prospective operating margins (measured by a tenant's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, management fees, and facility rent) of each tenant and at each facility; 

the ratio of our tenants' operating earnings to facility rent and to other fixed costs, including debt costs; 

changes in revenue sources of our tenants, including the relative mix of public payors (including Medicare, Medicaid/MediCal, and managed care in the U.S., as well as equivalent payors in Europe, and South America) and private payors (including commercial insurance and private pay patients); 

historical support (financial or otherwise) from governments and/or other public payor systems during major economic downturns/depressions; 

trends in tenants' cash collections, including comparison to recorded net patient service revenues, knowing and assessing current revenue cycle management systems and potential future planned upgrades or replacements; 

tenants' free cash flow; 

the potential impact of healthcare pandemics/epidemics, legislation, and other regulations (including changes in reimbursement) on our tenants', borrowers', and guarantors' profitability and liquidity; 

37 

the potential impact of any legal, regulatory, or compliance proceedings with our tenants (including at the facility level); 

the potential impact of supply chain and inflation-related challenges as they relate to new developments or capital addition projects; 

an ongoing assessment of the operating environment of our tenants, including demographics, competition, market position, status of compliance, accreditation, quality performance, and health outcomes as measured by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), The Joint Commission, and other governmental bodies in which our tenants operate; 

the level of investment in the hospital infrastructure and health IT systems; and 

physical real estate due diligence, typically including property condition and Phase 1 environmental assessments, along with routine property inspections thereafter. 

Certain business factors, in addition to those described above that may directly affect our tenants and borrowers, will likely materially influence our future results of operations. These factors include: 
 trends in interest rates and other costs due to general inflation and availability and increased costs from labor shortages could adversely impact the operations of our tenants and their ability to meet their lease obligations; 

changes in healthcare regulations that may limit the opportunities for physicians to participate in the ownership of healthcare providers and healthcare real estate; 

reductions (or non-timely increases) in reimbursements from Medicare, state healthcare programs, and commercial insurance providers that may reduce our tenants or borrowers profitability and our revenues; 

competition from other financing sources; and 

the ability of our tenants and borrowers to access funds in the credit markets. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Refer to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting policies, which include investments in real estate, purchase price allocation, loans, credit losses, losses from rent and interest receivables, investments accounted for under the fair value option election, and our accounting policy on consolidation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to these policies. 
 Overview 
 We are a self-advised REIT focused on investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities across the U.S. and selectively in foreign jurisdictions. Medical Properties Trust, Inc. was incorporated under Maryland law on August 27, 2003, and MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. was formed under Delaware law on September 10, 2003. We conduct substantially all of our business through MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. We acquire and develop healthcare facilities and lease the facilities to healthcare operating companies under long-term net leases, which require the tenant to bear most of the costs associated with the property. The majority of our leased assets are owned 100 ; however, we do own some leased assets through joint ventures with other partners that share our view that healthcare facilities are part of the infrastructure of any community, which we refer to as investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. We also make mortgage loans to healthcare operators collateralized by their real estate assets. In addition, we may make loans to certain of our operators through our TRS, the proceeds of which are typically used for working capital and other purposes. From time-to-time, we may make noncontrolling investments in our tenants, which we refer to as investments in unconsolidated operating entities. These investments are typically made in conjunction with larger real estate transactions with the tenant that give us a right to share in such tenant s profits and losses, and provide for certain minority rights and protections. Our business model facilitates acquisitions and recapitalizations, and allows operators of healthcare facilities to serve their communities by unlocking the value of their real estate assets to fund facility improvements, technology upgrades, and other investments in operations. 
 38 

At September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of 402 properties leased or loaned to 55 operators, of which four are under development. We manage our business as a single business segment. 
 At September 30, 2024, all of our investments are located in the U.S., Europe, and South America. Our total assets are made up of the following (dollars in thousands):

Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023 
 Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 801.2) million, or 1.34) per share compared to net income of 116.7 million, or 0.19 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income is primarily driven by the approximate 608 million of impairment charges primarily related to the global settlement reached with Steward and its lenders as described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the approximate 134 million unfavorable fair value adjustment to our investment in PHP Holdings, 137 million of accelerated amortization of in-place lease intangibles, and lower revenues from Steward and Prospect along with property sales, partially offset by approximately 90 million of gains as a result of the Dignity Health and UCHealth sales, both discussed further in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Normalized funds from operations FFO ), after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), was 93.9 million for the 2024 third quarter, or 0.16 per diluted share, as compared to 225.5 million, or 0.38 per diluted share, for the 2023 third quarter. This 58 decrease in Normalized FFO is primarily due to lower revenues from Steward moving to the cash basis of accounting on December 31, 2023, and lower revenues as a result of various disposals in 2023 and 2024.

Our total revenues for the 2024 third quarter are down 80.7 million, or 26 , over the same period in the prior year. This decrease is made up of the following: 
 Operating lease revenue (includes rent billed and straight-line rent) down 44.5 million from the prior year due to approximately 59 million of less revenue from our operators on a cash basis in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year. The majority of this decline is due to Steward (who moved to cash basis starting December 31, 2023, and executed the global settlement in the third quarter of 2024 described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) as we recognized 60 million of rent revenue in the 2023 third quarter, while receiving and recording approximately 10 million of rent revenue in the third quarter of 2024. Operating lease revenues in the 2024 third quarter further declined by approximately 47 million due to disposals and other leasing transactions in 2023 and 2024 (including 29 million from the Utah Transaction described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). 

39 

The decreases in operating lease revenue discussed above were partially offset by approximately 50 million more straight-line rent write-offs in the 2023 third quarter compared to the same period of 2024; approximately 2 million from incremental revenue from acquisitions in 2023, capital additions, and the commencement of rent on two development properties in 2024; 2.4 million of favorable foreign currency fluctuations; and approximately 6 million from increases in CPI above the contractual minimum escalations in our leases. 
 Income from financing leases down 16.3 million primarily due to not receiving any cash for rent revenue from Prospect (cash basis tenant) in the third quarter of 2024, whereas we recorded 16.5 million of rent for this tenant in the 2023 third quarter as part of the Prospect Transaction as described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. These decreases were partially offset by 0.2 million from the increase in CPI above the lease contractual minimum escalations. 

Interest and other income down approximately 20.0 million from the prior year due to the following: 

o Interest from loans down 19.2 million, primarily due to a 17 million decrease in interest income related to Steward and the international joint venture with moving to cash basis on December 31, 2023, and an approximate 4 million decrease from loan payoffs. These decreases are partially offset by 1.6 million of interest income from the Prime mortgage loan we received in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of the Prime disposal (further described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements including the repayment of this loan on August 29, 2024) and 0.4 million of favorable foreign currency fluctuations. 

o Other income down 0.8 million from the prior year as we had less direct reimbursements from our cash basis tenants for ground leases, property taxes, and insurance. 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 106.2 million and 106.7 million, respectively. This decrease is primarily related to debt principal repayments including paying off the Australian term loan facility in the second quarter of 2024 (A 470 million), the 2.550 Senior Unsecured Notes in December 2023, and the British pound sterling secured term loan due 2024 in the 2024 second quarter and paying down a portion of our revolver and British pound sterling term loan due 2025 in 2024. The decrease was offset by additional interest from our British pound sterling secured term loan due 2034 that closed in May 2024 and higher overall interest rates. Overall, our weighted-average interest rate was 4.3 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.0 for the same period in 2023, as our specific rates have increased due to a credit rating adjustment in March 2023 and our Credit Facility amendment on August 6, 2024. 
 Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization 
 Real estate depreciation and amortization during the third quarter of 2024 increased to 204.9 million from 77.8 million in 2023 due to approximately 137 million of additional amortization expense recorded in the 2024 third quarter to fully amortize the intangibles associated with two terminated master leases, including the Steward master lease that was terminated effective September 11, 2024 as part of the global settlement discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Property-related 
 Property-related expenses totaled 5.0 million and 6.5 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the property expenses in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, approximately 2.6 million and 3.3 million, respectively, represents costs that were reimbursed by our tenants and included in the Interest and other income line on our condensed consolidated statements of net income. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses decreased to 36.6 million for the 2024 third quarter, compared to 38.1 million for the 2023 third quarter. For the 2024 period, general and administrative expenses included 14.4 million of stock compensation expenses, of which 7 million related to certain 2024 stock grants with cash-settled features that are marked to fair value quarterly. 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on sale of real estate of 91.8 million primarily relates to the sale of eight Dignity Health facilities and 11 UCHealth facilities as more fully described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 40 

Real Estate and Other Impairment Charges, Net 
 In the 2024 third quarter, we recognized 607.9 million of real estate and other impairment charges. Of these charges, approximately 425 million consisted of the impairment of working capital loans and other secured loans advanced to Steward, and 180 million was related to real estate, including the Space Coast facilities and certain excess properties previously leased to Steward (as more fully described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Earnings (Loss) from Equity Interests 
 Earnings from equity interests was 21.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 11.3 million of earnings for the same period in 2023. This increase is primarily from our share of income in the Utah partnership that was formed in the 2024 second quarter, which included a 13.5 million positive fair value adjustment primarily related to the underlying real estate, (as further described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), partially offset by not recording any income in the third quarter of 2024 related to our Massachusetts-based partnership with Macquarie. 
 Debt Refinancing and Unutilized Financing (Costs) Benefit 
 Debt refinancing and unutilized financing costs were 0.7 million for the third quarter of 2024. These costs were incurred as a result of the reduction in revolving commitments under our Credit Facility and partial paydown of our British pound sterling term loan due 2025. We recognized a benefit for the same period of 2023, as a result of the purchase of 40 million of our 2.550 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023 at a discounted price. 
 Other (Including Fair Value Adjustments on Securities) 
 Other expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 169.8 million, compared to income of 41.1 million in the prior year. For the third quarter of 2024, we recognized unfavorable non-cash fair value adjustments to our investment in PHP Holdings and Aevis of approximately 140 million. The 2024 third quarter also included approximately 29 million of legal and other professional expenses associated with the Steward bankruptcy, responding to certain defamatory statements published by certain parties, including those who are defendants to a lawsuit we filed on March 30, 2023, among other things. For the third quarter of 2023, we recognized an approximate 30 million favorable non-cash fair value adjustment on our investment in PHP Holdings and a CHF 20 million (approximately 22 million) unrealized gain on our equity investment in Swiss Medical Network, partially offset by 2.8 million of expenses associated with responding to defamatory statements previously mentioned. 
 With certain investments accounted for at fair value, such as our investment in PHP Holdings, we may have positive or negative fair value adjustments from quarter-to-quarter. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based or withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The 9.0 million income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily based on the income generated by our investments in the U.K. and Germany and slightly less than the 10.1 million income tax expense in the third quarter of 2023. 
 We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, including our three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss position in certain entities, we concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately 386 million should be reflected against certain of our international and domestic net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024. In the future, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets, we will reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance, recognize an income tax benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and potentially incur higher income tax expense in future periods as income is earned.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023 
 Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.0) billion, or 3.33) per share compared to net income of 107.5 million, or 0.18 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income is primarily driven by the approximate 1.8 billion of impairment charges and negative fair value adjustments related to Steward and the international joint venture as further described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, we had an approximate 498 million unfavorable fair value adjustment to our investment in PHP Holdings in the first nine months of 2024 along with lower revenues from Steward and property sales. These decreases were partially offset by approximately 475 million of gains on real estate sales in the first nine months of 2024. Normalized funds from operations FFO ), after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), was 375.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, or 0.62 per diluted share, as compared to 733.0 million, or 1.22 per diluted share, for the same period of 2023. This 49 decrease in Normalized FFO is primarily due to lower revenues from Steward moving to the cash basis of accounting on December 31, 2023, and as a result of various disposals in 2023 and 2024.

Our total revenues for the first nine months of 2024 are down 230.5 million, or 23 , over the same period in the prior year. This decrease is made up of the following: 
 Operating lease revenue (includes rent billed and straight-line rent) down 91.3 million from the prior year, primarily due to approximately 164 million of less revenue from our operators on a cash basis in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the prior year. The majority of this decline is due to Steward as we recognized 181 million of rent revenue in the first nine months of 2023, while receiving and recording approximately 40 million of rent revenue in the first nine months of 2024. 

Operating lease revenues in the first nine months of 2024 further declined by approximately 107 million due to disposals and other leasing transactions in 2023 and 2024 (including approximately 60 million from the Utah Transaction described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). These decreases are partially offset by approximately 145 million more straight-line rent write-offs in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period of 2024 (related to the Steward and CommonSpirit transaction in 2023 described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements); approximately 11 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions in 2023, capital additions, and the commencement of rent on two development properties in 2024; approximately 7 million of favorable foreign currency fluctuations; and approximately 16 million from increases in CPI above the contractual minimum escalations in our leases. 
 Income from financing leases down 53.9 million primarily due to receiving cash of approximately 25 million for rent revenue from Prospect (cash basis tenant) in the first nine months of 2024, whereas we recorded 72 million of rent for this tenant in the first nine months of 2023. In addition, financing lease income was lower due to an approximate 8 million decrease from the disposal of three Prime financing leases in the third quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by approximately 1 million from the increase in CPI above the lease contractual minimum escalations. 

Interest and other income down 85.3 million from the prior year due to the following: 

o Interest from loans down 66.5 million, primarily due to an approximate 49 million decrease in interest income related to Steward and the international joint venture with the move to cash basis on December 31, 2023 and the Steward global settlement in the third quarter of 2024, and an approximate 14 million decrease from loan payoffs and reserves (including 9.1 million from the sale of our interest in the Priory syndicated term loan in the first quarter of 2024). We also recorded approximately 9.5 million more interest revenue in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period of 2024 as a result of the Prospect Transaction as described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. These decreases are partially offset by approximately 4 million of interest income from the Prime mortgage loan we received as a result of the 

42 

Prime disposal (further described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements including the repayment on August 29, 2024), 1 million of higher income from annual escalations due to increases in CPI, and approximately 1.5 million of favorable foreign currency fluctuations. 

o Other income down 18.8 million from the prior year as we had less direct reimbursements from our cash basis tenants for ground leases, property taxes, and insurance. 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 316.4 million and 308.8 million, respectively. This increase is primarily related to an increase in borrowings on our revolving credit facility on average during the comparable periods that carried higher interest rates (as variable rate debt) compared to the lower fixed interest rates of debt that was repaid in 2023, including the A 730 million Australian term loan facility paid off in the 2023 second quarter and the 2.550 Senior Unsecured Notes paid off in December 2023. We closed on a new British pound sterling secured term loan in May 2024 that also partially contributed to higher interest expense period over period. Overall, our weighted-average interest rate was 4.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.9 for the same period in 2023, as our specific rates have increased due to a credit rating adjustment in March 2023 and our Credit Facility amendment on August 6, 2024. 
 Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization 
 Real estate depreciation and amortization during the first nine months of 2024 decreased to 382.7 million from 526.1 million in 2023 due to accelerating the amortization of lease intangibles as part of the sale of hospital operations by Steward and re-leasing of five Steward Utah facilities to CommonSpirit in May 2023 (approximately 286 million) and the sale of various properties in 2024 and 2023. This decrease is partially offset by approximately 170 million of additional amortization expense recorded in 2024 primarily to fully amortize the intangibles associated with two master leases, including the Steward master lease that was terminated effective September 11, 2024. 
 Property-related 
 Property-related expenses totaled 17.5 million and 38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the property expenses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, approximately 9.8 million and 28.6 million, respectively, represents costs that were reimbursed by our tenants and included in the Interest and other income line on our condensed consolidated statements of net income. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses decreased to 105.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 115.4 million for the same period of 2023. For the 2024 period, general and administrative expenses included 30.6 million of stock compensation expense, of which 9 million related to certain 2024 stock grants with cash-settled features that are marked to fair value quarterly. 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on sale of real estate of 475.2 million primarily related to the disposal of five Prime facilities, a 75 interest in five Utah facilities as part of the Utah Transaction, and the sale of eight Dignity Health facilities and 11 UCHealth facilities as more fully described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Real Estate and Other Impairment Charges, Net 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we recognized 1.4 billion of real estate and other impairment charges and fair value adjustments, primarily associated with our investments in Steward and the international joint venture as further described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In the first nine months of 2023, we recorded a 93.3 million net impairment charge, of which 82 million related to the Australia Transaction and 11 million was a non-cash impairment charge on the three Prime properties as more fully described in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Earnings (Loss) from Equity Interests 
 Loss from equity interests was 369.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34.8 million of earnings for the same period in 2023, primarily due to the 410 million charge in the second quarter of 2024 associated with the real estate impairment in our Massachusetts-based partnership with Macquarie as further described in Note 3 to the condensed 
 43 

consolidated financial statements. This was partially offset by our share of income on our new Utah partnership as a result of the Utah Transaction in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Debt Refinancing and Unutilized Financing (Costs) Benefit 
 Debt refinancing and unutilized financing costs were 3.7 million for the first nine months of 2024. These costs were incurred as a result of the reduction in revolving commitments under our Credit Facility and partial paydown of our British pound sterling term loan due 2025, both of which are described in more detail in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Our debt refinancing and unutilized financing net benefit for the first nine months of 2023 was a result of a 0.9 million benefit related to the purchase of 40 million of our 2.550 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023 in the third quarter of 2023 at a discounted price, partially offset by 0.8 million of costs associated with the partial prepayment of our A 1.2 billion Australian term loan in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Other (Including Fair Value Adjustments on Securities) 
 Other expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 566.8 million, compared to 25.4 million of income in the prior year. For 2024, we recognized an approximate 498 million unfavorable fair value adjustment to our investment in PHP Holdings. In addition, we incurred a 7.8 million economic loss from the sale of our interest in the Priory syndicated term loan and approximately 46.5 million of legal and other professional expenses associated with the Steward bankruptcy, responding to certain defamatory statements published by certain parties, including those who are defendants to a lawsuit we filed on March 30, 2023, among other things. For 2023, we had an approximate 30 million favorable non-cash fair value adjustment on our investment in PHP Holdings and a CHF 20 million (approximately 22 million) unrealized gain on our equity investment in Swiss Medical Network, partially offset by 13 million of expenses associated with responding to defamatory statements previously mentioned. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based or withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The 34.5 million income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily based on the income generated by our investments in the U.K. and Germany, and included 5 million of additional tax expense in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of the gain on the interest rate swap associated with the internal restructuring of the British pound sterling term loan due 2025. In comparison, we had a 134.7 million income tax benefit in the first nine months of 2023, which included a 158 million benefit by entering the U.K. REIT regime and a 5.0 million tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2023 related to the expected sale of our Australia facilities. 
 We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, including our three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss position in certain entities, we concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately 386 million should be reflected against certain of our international and domestic net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024. In the future, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets, we will reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance, recognize an income tax benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and potentially incur higher income tax expense in future periods as income is earned. 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Investors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, including amortization related to in-place lease intangibles, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition, we disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations less meaningful to investors and analysts.

We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs (if any are not paid by our tenants) to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to MPT common stockholders to FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands except per share data):

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 2024 Cash Flow Activity 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we generated approximately 169 million of cash flows from operating activities, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. In addition to operating cash flows, we received approximately 1.8 billion during the first nine months of 2024 from the Utah Transaction and the sale of 25 properties (as further discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), along with approximately 130 million from the sale of our interest in the syndicated Priory term loan and remaining minority interest in Lifepoint Behavioral. In May 2024, we closed on a new secured term loan, generating proceeds of approximately 800 million. We used our operating cash flows, asset sale proceeds, and 
 45 

term loan proceeds to fund our dividends of 273 million, pay down over 1 billion of our revolving credit facility and British pound sterling term loan due 2025, and to pay off our British pound sterling secured term loan due 2024. 
 See below for further details of these transactions along with additional liquidity activity in the first nine months of 2024: 
 we completed the sales of 11 properties to UCHealth for approximately 86 million of proceeds and eight properties to Dignity Health for approximately 160 million of proceeds; 

we completed the sale of five properties to Prime for cash proceeds of 250 million along with a 100 million interest-bearing mortgage loan that was fully repaid on August 29, 2024; 

we completed the Utah Transaction (as discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) that generated cash proceeds of approximately 1.1 billion. With the proceeds from these asset sales, we paid off and terminated our 306 million Australian term loan facility that was due in May 2024 and paid down a portion of our revolving credit facility; 

on May 24, 2024, we closed on a secured loan facility with a consortium of institutional investors that provides for a term loan in aggregate principal amount of approximately 631 million (approximately 800 million) secured by a portfolio of 27 properties located in the U.K. currently leased to affiliates of Circle. The facility carries a fixed rate of 6.877 over its 10-year term, excluding fees and expenses, and is interest-only (payable quarterly in advance) through the maturity date. The facility is secured by first priority mortgages or similar security instruments on the relevant properties, including assignments of rents and security over accounts, and is non-recourse to us. We used the majority of the net proceeds of the facility to pay down portions of our revolving credit facility and British pound sterling term loan due 2025, and to pay off our British pound sterling secured term loan due 2024 (approximately 105 million); 

in May 2024, both S P Global Ratings and Moody's downgraded our corporate ratings. These ratings declining could have a negative impact on us in the form of higher interest rates on any new or amended debt instruments we may enter into in the future; and 

primarily as a result of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, not being filed timely, we are currently ineligible to file a new short-form registration statement on Form S-3 or access our existing registration statement on Form S-3 for sales of securities, including under our at-the-market ("ATM") program, until June 1, 2025, which may impair our ability to raise capital in the public markets. While we are able to use other registration avenues for public offerings, such avenues are less expeditious and efficient than a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. See "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, for additional information. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we recovered cash related to our Norwood property that exceeded our recovery receivables (as discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) and sold three facilities for approximately 45 million. In addition, we funded a quarterly cash dividend of 48 million on October 10, 2024, which was declared by our Board of Directors on August 22, 2024. Finally, on November 8, 2024, Astrana Health entered into a binding agreement to purchase the majority of PHP Holdings for approximately 745 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. After satisfaction of certain obligations, we expect to receive approximately 200 million in total proceeds. We expect to receive the majority of these proceeds in the first half of 2025, while a 50 million payment is expected by 2027. 
 Debt Amendments and Covenant Compliance 
 On April 12, 2024, we amended the Credit Facility and certain other agreements to (i) reduce revolving commitments from 1.8 billion to 1.4 billion, (ii) apply certain proceeds from the Utah Transaction and other asset sales and debt transactions to repay the Australian term loan facility and certain other outstanding obligations, including revolving loans under the Credit Facility to the extent necessary to reduce the outstanding borrowings to no more than the amended 1.4 billion commitment, (iii) lower the maximum permitted secured leverage ratio from 40 to 25 , and (iv) waive the 10 cap on unencumbered asset value attributable to tenants subject to a bankruptcy event for purposes of determining compliance with the unsecured leverage ratio for the trailing four fiscal quarter period ended June 30, 2024, and for purposes of determining pro forma compliance with the unsecured leverage ratio for certain asset sale and debt transactions. 
 On August 6, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility and the British pound sterling term loan due 2025 (the Amendments to (i) further reduce our maximum borrowing in the Credit Facility from 1.4 billion to 1.28 billion, (ii) increase borrowing spreads to 300 basis points during the Modified Covenant Period (defined below) and then to 225 basis points after the Modified Covenant Period, and (iii) require that proceeds of certain future asset sales and debt transactions (during the Modified Covenant Period) be applied to repay certain outstanding obligations, including our revolving loans (by 15 of such proceeds but for which the revolving loans can be reborrowed) and our British pound sterling term loan due 2025 (by 50 of such proceeds). 
 The Amendments also amended certain covenants including increasing the maximum total leverage ratio covenant from 60 to 65 and the maximum unsecured leverage ratio covenant from 65 to 70 and decreasing the minimum unsecured interest coverage 
 46 

ratio from 1.75:1.00 to 1.45:1.00. The Amendments were effective as of June 30, 2024 and will continue in effect through and including September 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated by us (the Modified Covenant Period at which point the credit agreement provides that covenants will automatically reset to their prior levels. In addition, the Amendments permanently reduced the minimum consolidated adjusted net worth covenant from approximately 6.7 billion to 5 billion, in each case plus the sum of certain equity proceeds. The Amendments also limit the payment of dividends in cash during the Modified Covenant Period to 0.08 per share in any fiscal quarter, but the Amendments do not provide any additional restrictions on the payment of dividends outside of the Modified Covenant Period. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants. However, as of September 30, 2024, we would not have been in compliance with certain covenants without the Amendments discussed above. Our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants, including the reset leverage and interest coverage requirements after the end of the Modified Covenant Period, depends primarily on reducing debt through asset sales, retention of cash generated from our monthly rent and interest receipts, extending maturities of certain debt instruments, and other access to capital. We expect to continue to comply with these covenants, but if we are not in compliance, including following the expiration of the Modified Covenant Period, we would have to seek additional amendments to our covenants. However, no assurances can be made that such amendments will be approved by our lenders. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Credit Facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable which could have a material adverse impact to the Company. 
 2023 Cash Flow Activity 
 During the first nine months of 2023, we generated approximately 370.4 million of cash flows from operating activities, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows (along with cash on-hand and borrowings on our revolving credit facility) to fund our dividends of 524.2 million. 
 In regard to other investing and financing activities in the first nine months of 2023, we did the following: 
 a) sold seven Australian properties as part of the Australia Transaction resulting in proceeds of A 730 million and used such proceeds to pay down our Australian term loan; 

b) sold three properties to Prime resulting in proceeds of 100 million; 

c) received approximately 500 million of loan principal proceeds, including approximately 200 million from the Lifepoint Transaction, 100 million from Steward after the completion of their sale of Utah properties to CHIC, CHF 60 million from the payoff of a loan by Infracore, and approximately 100 million from the sale of our temporary interest in Steward's asset-backed credit facility; 

d) funded approximately 250 million of new investments, including 95 million to Prospect as part of its recapitalization plan that was implemented on May 23, 2023; 

e) funded approximately 195 million to Steward, including its temporary participation in its syndicated four-year asset-backed credit facility and loans for general working capital purposes; and 

f) retired approximately 40 million of our 2.550 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023. 

See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on the transactions above. 
 Short-term Liquidity Requirements: 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements typically consist of general and administrative expenses, dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements, interest payments on our debt, and planned funding commitments on development and capital improvement projects for the next twelve months. Our monthly rent and interest receipts and distributions from our joint venture arrangements are typically enough to cover our short-term liquidity requirements. 
 However, with higher interest rates, loss of revenue from asset sales, ramping up of cash rents from new operators of 17 properties formerly leased to Steward, not as predictable revenue from Prospect, and 1.2 billion of debt coming due within the next twelve months, we have looked to other initiatives to improve cash flows including: 
 through November 8, 2024, we have raised approximately 2.9 billion of liquidity (as previously discussed above under "2024 Cash Flow Activity") comfortably exceeding our initial full year liquidity target of 2.0 billion; 

completing the binding sale of PHP Holdings to Astrana Health, from which we expect to receive approximately 150 million in the first half of 2025 with the remaining 50 million to be received by 2027; 

completing the binding sale of three Connecticut facilities to Yale New Haven with a contract price of 355 million, which such sale has been approved by the state of Connecticut's Office of Health Strategy; 

47 

extending the maturity of existing term loans; and 

managing the form (cash or stock) and amount of our dividend requirements in line with the credit facility amendment dated August 6, 2024 and REIT requirements. 

We believe these initiatives, along with liquidity of approximately 1.2 billion (including cash on-hand, availability under our 1.28 billion revolving credit facility, and recovery proceeds received on our Norwood property as discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) at November 8, 2024, and routine cash receipts of rent and interest can fund our short-term liquidity requirements. 
 In addition to the cash flow improvement initiatives discussed above, we could see further cash flow upside from the transition of our remaining vacant facilities to new healthcare operators (whether it be from a sale of our real estate or in the form of rent paid by the new lessee). 
 Long-term Liquidity Requirements : 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements generally consist of the same requirements described above under Short-term Liquidity Requirements along with the acquisition of real estate and the funding of debt maturities coming due after the next twelve months. At this time, we do not expect any material acquisitions of real estate in the foreseeable future. 
 As described previously, our monthly rent and interest receipts and distributions from our joint venture arrangements along with our current liquidity of approximately 1.2 billion at November 8, 2024, are typically enough to cover our short-term liquidity requirements. However, to address upcoming debt maturities (as outlined below), we may need to look to other sources, which may include one or a combination of the following: 
 reducing our dividend (or moving to a stock dividend), while still complying with REIT requirements and credit facility covenants, as amended on August 6, 2024; 

further property sales or joint ventures, including the completion of the binding sale of three Connecticut facilities to Yale with a contract price of 355 million; 

monetizing our investment in operators, including our investment in PHP Holdings that is expected to close in the first half of 2025; 

entering into new secured loans on real estate; 

extending the maturity of existing term loans; 

identifying and implementing cost reduction opportunities; 

entering into new bank term loans or issuing new USD, EUR, or GBP denominated debt securities; and 

sale of equity securities. 

However, there is no assurance that conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful. As a result of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, not being filed timely, we are currently ineligible to file a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 or access our existing registration statement on Form S-3 for sales of securities, including under our ATM program, until June 1, 2025, which may impair our ability to raise capital in the public markets. While we are able to use other registration avenues for public offerings, such avenues are less expeditious and efficient than a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. See "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024.

It is our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and to efficiently manage corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income. However, our Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends we can make- see Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. We seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible. We may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate or foreign currency exposure. For interest rate hedging, these decisions are principally based on our policy to match investments with comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates. For foreign currency hedging, these decisions are principally based on how our investments are financed, the long-term nature of our investments, the need to repatriate earnings back to the U.S., and the general trend in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 In addition, the value of our facilities will be subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the ability of our tenants to generate profits. 
 Our primary exposure to market risks relates to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency. The following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value, earnings, and cash flows of our significant financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates and exchange rates as if these changes had occurred. The hypothetical changes chosen for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. These forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from these hypothetical changes. They do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in market conditions. In addition, they do not include measures we may take to minimize our exposure such as entering into future interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate increases on our variable rate debt. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows. Conversely, for floating rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net 
 49 

income to common stockholders and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. At September 30, 2024, our outstanding debt totaled 9.3 billion, which consisted of fixed-rate debt of approximately 8.7 billion (after considering interest rate swaps in-place) and variable rate debt of 0.6 billion. If market interest rates increase by 10 on our fixed rate debt, the fair value of our debt at September 30, 2024 would decrease by approximately 212.0 million. Changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt will not have any impact on us unless we decided to repurchase the debt in the open market. 
 If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by 10 , the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by 4.2 million per year. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by 10 , the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by 4.2 million per year. This assumes that the average amount outstanding under our variable rate debt for a year is 0.6 billion, the balance of such variable rate debt at September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Sensitivity 
 With our investments in the U.K., Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Finland, and Colombia, we are subject to fluctuations in the British pound, euro, Swiss franc, and Colombian peso to U.S. dollar currency exchange rates. Although we generally deem investments in these countries to be of a long-term nature, are typically able to match any non-U.S. dollar borrowings with investments in such currencies, and historically have not needed to repatriate a material amount of earnings back to the U.S., increases or decreases in the value of the respective non-U.S. dollar currencies to U.S. dollar exchange rates may impact our financial condition and/or our results of operations. Based solely on our 2024 operating results to-date and on an annualized basis, a 10 change to the following exchange rates would have impacted our net income, FFO, and Normalized FFO by the amounts below (in thousands):

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. 
 We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are party to various lawsuits as further described in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements. We have not recorded a liability related to any particular lawsuit because, at this time, we are unable to determine whether an unfavorable outcome is probable or to estimate reasonably possible losses. 
 In addition to the foregoing, we are currently and have in the past been subject to various legal proceedings and regulatory actions in connection with our business. We believe that the resolution of any current pending legal or regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Nonetheless, we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, as legal and regulatory matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 Other than the risk factors disclosed on pages 41 and 42 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors as presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
