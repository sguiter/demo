Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other legal authority, which statements may involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results, financial position and liquidity, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. 
 
 You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur at all or on a specified timeframe. The cautionary statements set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q identify important factors which you should consider in evaluating our forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things: business disruptions or other consequences of economic instability, political instability, civil unrest, armed hostilities and global conflict, natural and man-made disasters, pandemics or other public health crises, or other catastrophic events; the impact of changes or declines in consumer spending and inflation on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition; active, pending or threatened litigation; our ability to manage and sustain our growth and profitability effectively, including in our ecommerce business, forecast our operating results, and manage inventory levels; our cash flows, changes in the market price of the Company s common stock, global economic and market conditions and other considerations that could impact the specific timing, price and size of repurchases under our stock repurchase program or our ability to fund any stock repurchases; our ability to improve our products and develop new products; our ability to successfully open and operate new showrooms; our ability to advance, implement or achieve the goals set forth in our ESG Report; our ability to realize the expected benefits of investments in our supply chain and infrastructure; disruption in our supply chain and dependence on foreign manufacturing and imports for our products; execution of our share repurchase program and its expected benefits for enhancing long-term shareholder value; our ability to acquire new customers and engage existing customers; reputational risk associated with increased use of social media; our ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled associates; system interruption or failures in our technology infrastructure needed to service our customers, process transactions and fulfill orders; the impact of the restatement of our previously issued audited financial statements as of and for the year ended January 29, 2023 and our unaudited condensed financial statements for the quarterly periods ended April 30, 2023, October 30, 2022, July 31, 2022 and May 1, 2022, and the related litigation and investigation related to such restatements; any inability to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information through breach of our computer system; the ability of third-party providers to continue uninterrupted service; the impact of tariffs, and the countermeasures and tariff mitigation initiatives; the regulatory environment in which we operate, our ability to maintain, grow and enforce our brand and intellectual property rights and avoid infringement or violation of the intellectual property rights of others; and our ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry. 
 
 We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the factors that may impact the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the sections entitled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

on the anniversary date of the grant date if employed at the time of vesting. The valuation of these RSU awards is based solely on the fair value of the Company s stock on the date of grant. 
 
 Performance Based Restricted Stock Units 
 
 Performance based restricted stock units ("PSU awards") granted under the 2017 Equity Plan are generally subject to both a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. PSU awards will vest upon the achievement of specified performance targets and subject to continued service through the applicable vesting dates. The stock-based compensation expense relating to PSU awards is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. 
 Stock Options 
 In June 2019, the Company granted non-statutory stock options to certain officers of the Company with an exercise price of per share. of the stock options are subject to vesting on the third anniversary of the date of grant if the officers are still employed by the Company and the average closing price of the Company s common stock for the prior consecutive trading days has been at least by the third anniversary of the grant. Both the employment and the market condition were originally to be satisfied no later than June 5, 2022 or the options would terminate. These options were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model to account for the path dependent market conditions that stipulate when and whether or not the options shall vest.

 Share Repurchase Program

Under the share repurchase program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase. The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and will be dependent on market conditions, liquidity, applicable securities laws, and other factors. We may suspend or discontinue the share repurchase program at any time. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company, if any, is not guaranteed. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically without prior notice.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 4, 2024. As discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified in the Forward-Looking Statements section herein and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday closest to February 1. Each fiscal year generally is comprised of four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks, the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. The fiscal year ended February 2, 2025 will consist of 52 weeks. 

Overview 
 We are a technology driven company that designs, manufactures and sells unique, high quality furniture derived through our proprietary "Designed for Life" approach which results in products that are built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve as our customers lives do. Our current product offering is comprised of modular couches called Sactionals, premium foam beanbag chairs called Sacs, the Sactionals StealthTech Sound + Charge System, and the most recently launched PillowSac TM Accent Chair. Innovation is at the center of our design philosophy with all of our core products protected by a robust portfolio of utility patents. We market and sell our products through an omni-channel platform that includes direct-to-consumer touch points in the form of our own showrooms, which include our mobile concierge and kiosks, and online directly at www.lovesac.com. We believe that our ecommerce centric approach, coupled with our ability to deliver our large upholstered products through express couriers, is unique to the furniture industry. 

Macroeconomic Factors 
 There are a number of macroeconomic factors and uncertainties affecting the overall business environment and our business, including increased inflation, elevated interest rates, weak housing market conditions, consumer debt and available credit, layoffs, political uncertainty, global conflicts and uncertainties in the global financial markets. These factors have had and may continue to have a negative impact on markets in which we operate, including the potential for an economic recession, a continued downturn in the housing market, and a reduction in consumer discretionary spending. We believe that these macroeconomic factors have caused a significant shift in consumer spending and a decline in the demand for home furnishings which has contributed to the slowdown in demand that we have experienced in our business which may continue in future periods.

Product Overview 
 Our products serve as a set of building blocks that can be rearranged, restyled and re-upholstered with any new setting, mitigating constant changes in fashion and style. They are built to last and evolve throughout a customer s life. 
 Sactionals . Our Sactional product line currently represents a majority of our net sales. We believe our Sactionals platform is unlike competing products in its adaptability yet is comparable aesthetically to similarly priced premium couches and sectionals. Our Sactional products include a number of patented features relating to their geometry and modularity, coupling mechanisms and other features. Utilizing only two, standardized pieces, seats and sides, and approximately 200 high quality, tight-fitting covers that are removable, washable, and changeable, customers can create numerous permutations of a sectional couch with minimal effort. Customization is further enhanced with our specialty-shaped modular offerings, such as our wedge seat, roll arm and angled sides. In September 2024, we launched the AnyTable TM , a versatile table that seamlessly enhances any Sactionals living space. Our custom features and accessories can be added easily and quickly to a Sactional to meet endless design, style, storage and utility preferences, reflecting our Designed for Life philosophy. Sactionals are built to meet the highest durability and structural standards applicable to fixed couches. Sactionals are comprised of standardized units and we guarantee their compatibility over time, which we believe is a major pillar of their value proposition to the consumer. Our Sactionals represented 91.4 and 91.1 of our net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively, and 91.5 and 90.9 of our net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our Sactionals StealthTech Sound + Charge product line complements our Sactionals as a unique innovation that features immersive surround sound by Harman Kardon and convenient wireless charging, all seamlessly embedded and hidden inside the adaptable Sactionals platform. The system includes two Sound + Charge Sides each with embedded front- and rear-firing Harman Kardon speakers, a Subwoofer that easily integrates into a Sactionals Seat Frame and a Center Channel, all working in unison to deliver captivating surround sound that is completely hidden from view. In May 2023, we introduced Satellite Subwoofers as an add-on to the Sound + Charge System. The Satellite Subwoofer is an upgrade to the existing StealthTech setup and enhances the bass and overall entertainment experience. 
 Sacs . We believe that our Sacs product line is a category leader in oversized beanbags. The Sac product line offers 5 different sizes ranging from 35 pounds to 95 pounds with capacity to seat 3+ people on the larger model Sacs. Filled with Durafoam, a proprietary blend of shredded foam, Sacs provide serene comfort and guaranteed durability. Their removable covers are machine washable and may be easily replaced with a wide selection of cover offerings. In May 2024, we launched the PillowSac TM Accent Chair Frame, an accessory that elevates the style and comfort of our existing PillowSac. Our Sacs represented 7.2 and 7.3 of our net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively, and 7.1 and 7.5 of our net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. 
 Other Our Other product line enhances the versatility of our Sacs and Sactionals, catering to the evolving demands and preferences of our customers. Our current offerings also include Sactional-specific drink holders, Footsac blankets, decorative pillows, fitted seat tables, ottomans in various styles and finishes, and the unique Sactionals Power Hub. These products provide our customers with the flexibility to personalize their furnishings with both decorative and practical add-ons, ensuring they can adapt to changing style preferences 

Sales Channels 
 We offer our products through an omni-channel platform that provides a seamless and meaningful experience to our customers online and in-store. Our distribution strategy allows us to reach customers through three distinct, brand-enhancing channels. 
 Showrooms . We market and sell our products through 258 showroom locations at top tier malls, lifestyle centers, mobile concierge, kiosk, and street locations in 42 states in the U.S. We carefully select the best small-footprint showroom locations in high-end malls and lifestyle centers for our showrooms. Compared to traditional retailers, our showrooms require significantly less square footage because of our need to have only a few in-store sample configurations for display and our ability to stock our inventory for immediate sale. The architecture and layout of

Table of Contents 

these showrooms is designed to communicate our brand personality and key product features. Our goal is to educate first-time customers, creating an environment where people can touch, feel, read, and understand the technology behind our products. Our showroom concept emphasizes our unique product platform and utilizes technology in more experiential ways to increase traffic and net sales. Net sales generated by this channel accounted for 60.7 and 64.0 of total net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively, and 61.8 and 62.3 of our net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. 
 Ecommerce . Through our ecommerce channel, we believe we are able to significantly enhance the consumer shopping experience for home furnishings, driving deeper brand engagement and loyalty, while also realizing more favorable margins than our showroom locations. We believe our robust technological capabilities position us well to benefit from the growing consumer preference to transact at home and via mobile devices. With furniture especially suited to ecommerce applications, our net sales generated by this channel accounted for 29.9 and 26.0 of total net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively, and 28.6 and 27.1 of our net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. 
 Other touchpoints . We augment our showrooms with other touchpoint strategies including online and in store pop-up-shops, shop-in-shops, and barter inventory transactions. 
 In store and online pop-up-shops . We utilize in store pop-up-shops to increase the number of locations where customers can experience and purchase our products, a low cost alternative to drive brand awareness, in store net sales, and ecommerce net sales. These in store pop-up-shops are typically 10-day shows and are staffed similarly to our showrooms with associates trained to demonstrate and sell our products and promote our brand. For the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we operated 165 and 147 in store pop-up-shops, respectively, and 2 online pop-up-shops on Costco.com, and for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we operated 423 and 342 in store pop-up-shops, respectively, and 7 online pop-up-shops on Costco.com. 
 Shop-in-shops . Shop-in-shops are designed to be in permanent locations carrying the same digital technology of our showrooms and are also staffed with associates trained to demonstrate and sell our products. Shop-in-shops require less capital expenditure to open a productive space to drive brand awareness and touchpoint opportunities for demonstrating and selling our products. As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we operated 49 and 41 Best Buy shop-in-shops, respectively. 
 Barter inventory transactions . Our barter inventory transactions with a third party vendor are part of our Circle Operations ("CO"), Designed for Life, and Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") initiatives. CO is a way of doing business that is meant to reduce our footprint, while dramatically extending the life of products through more looped, localized, long-term, and sustainable practices, policies, and programs. We repurpose returned open-box inventory in exchange for media credits, which are being used to support our advertising initiatives to create brand awareness and drive net sales growth. 
 Other net sales which includes pop-up-shop sales, shop-in-shop sales, and barter inventory transactions accounted for 9.4 and 10.0 of our total net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively, and 9.6 and 10.6 of our net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. 

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 We consider a variety of financial and operating measures, including the following, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. 
 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales reflect our sale of merchandise plus shipping and handling revenue less returns and discounts. Net sales made at Company operated showrooms, including shop-in-shops and pop-up-shops, and via the web are recognized, typically at the point of transference of title when the goods are shipped.

Table of Contents 

Omni-channel Comparable Net Sales 
 
 Omni-channel comparable net sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable net sales includes sales at all retail locations and online, open greater than 12 months (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Comparable net sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In fiscal year 2024, we updated how we calculate comparable sales to better reflect our business, store growth and omni-channel sales approach. 
 
 New Customer 
 
 We define a customer as new when the customer has completed a transaction at Lovesac either at a showroom or internet channel only for the first time. In fiscal 2024, we updated how we calculate new and repeat customers to better reflect business across all of our channels as well as the purchase cycle of the categories in which we compete. 
 
 Cost of Merchandise Sold 
 
 Cost of merchandise sold includes the direct cost of sold merchandise; inventory shrinkage; inventory adjustments due to obsolescence, including excess and slow-moving inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value reserves; inbound freight; all freight costs to ship merchandise to our showrooms, and warehousing and all logistics costs associated with shipping product to our customers. Certain competitors and other retailers may report gross profit differently than we do, by excluding from gross profit some or all of the costs related to their distribution network and instead including them in selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and profit margin may not be comparable to other companies. 
 
 The primary drivers of our cost of merchandise sold are raw materials costs, labor costs in the countries where we source our merchandise, and logistics costs. We expect gross profit to increase to the extent that we successfully grow our net sales and continue to realize scale economics with our manufacturing partners. We review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and use product markdowns to efficiently sell these products. The timing and level of markdowns are driven primarily by customer acceptance of our merchandise. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is equal to our net sales less cost of merchandise sold. Gross profit as a percentage of our net sales is referred to as gross margin. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs, other than advertising and marketing expense, not included in cost of merchandise sold. These expenses include all payroll and payroll-related expenses; showroom expenses, including occupancy costs related to showroom operations, such as rent and common area maintenance; occupancy and expenses related to many of our operations at our headquarters, including utilities, equity based compensation, financing related expense; public company expenses; customer financing fees; and credit card transaction fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is usually higher in lower volume quarters and lower in higher volume quarters because a significant portion of the costs are relatively fixed. 
 
 Our recent revenue growth has been accompanied by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The most significant components of these increases are payroll and rent costs. We expect these expenses to increase as we grow our business. We expect to leverage total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales as net sales volumes continue to grow. We expect to continue to invest in infrastructure to support the Company's growth. Our continued infrastructure investments include research and development costs on our existing and future products and foundational technology investments to support our continued growth. These investments will lessen the impact of expense leveraging during the period of investment with the greater impact of expense leveraging happening after the period of investment. However, total selling, general and administrative expenses generally will leverage during the periods of investments with the greatest leverage occurring within the fourth quarter.

Advertising and Marketing Expense 
 Advertising and marketing expense include digital, social, and traditional advertising and marketing initiatives, that cover all of our business channels. Advertising and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase as a percentage of net sales as we continue to invest in advertising and marketing which has accelerated net sales growth.

 Interest income, net was 2.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024, compared to 1.0 million in the prior year period. Interest income earned on the Company s cash and cash equivalents balances was favorable from higher interest rates compared to the prior year period. 
 Benefit from income taxes 
 Income tax benefit was 8.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024, compared to 2.3 million in the prior year period. The change in benefit is primarily driven by higher net loss before taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our business relies on cash flows from operations, our revolving line of credit (see Revolving Line of Credit below) and securities issuances as our primary sources of liquidity. At November 3, 2024, we had 61.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary cash needs are for marketing and advertising, inventory, payroll, showroom rent, capital expenditures associated with opening new showrooms and updating existing showrooms, as well as infrastructure and information technology. We periodically use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventory, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, and other current liabilities. We believe that cash expected to be generated from operations, the availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Historically, we have invested significant capital expenditures in opening new showrooms and updating existing showrooms. These capital expenditures have increased in the past and may continue to increase in future periods as we open additional showrooms. Capital expenditures are anticipated to support our showroom growth, including capital outlays for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, and the construction of new showrooms. Cash paid for capital expenditures was 16.1 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods indicated are shown in the following table: 
 Condensed Statement of Cash flow Data: Thirty-nine weeks ended (amounts in thousands) November 3, 2024 October 29, 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (5,046) 20,123 Net cash used in investing activities (16,078) (22,240) Net cash used in financing activities (4,221) (3,678) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (25,345) (5,795) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 61,691 37,738 
 
 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities 
 Cash from operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, non-cash lease expense, and deferred income taxes and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 5.0 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 20.1 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by higher net loss and changes in working capital related to income taxes paid and inventory management actions. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Investing activities consist primarily of investments related to capital expenditures for new showroom openings and the acquisition of intangible assets. 
 For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, net cash used in investing activities were 16.1 million and 22.2 million, respectively, mainly as a result of investments in new showrooms.

Table of Contents 

Net cash used in financing activities 
 Financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of our common stock, taxes paid for the net settlement of equity awards and payment of deferred financing costs. 
 For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 4.2 million and 3.7 million, respectively, mainly due to the repurchase of our common stock and taxes paid for the net share settlement of equity awards, respectively. 
 
 Revolving Line of Credit 
 On March 25, 2022, we amended our existing credit agreement providing for an asset-based revolving credit facility with the lenders party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, ("Wells Fargo Bank"), as administrative agent. The maturity date of our credit agreement was extended to March 25, 2024 and, among other things, the maximum revolver commitment was increased from 25.0 million to 40.0 million, subject to borrowing base and availability restrictions. 
 On March 24, 2023, we amended the credit agreement to extend the maturity date to September 30, 2024. On July 29, 2024, we amended the credit agreement to add an uncommitted accordion feature that allows the Company, subject to certain customary conditions, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by 10 million and, among other things, extend the maturity date of the loans made under the Amendment from September 30, 2024 to July 29, 2029. 
 For additional information regarding our line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, see Note 7. Financing Arrangements. As of November 3, 2024 and February 4, 2024, the Company s borrowing availability under the line of credit was 36.0 million, and there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. 
 Share Repurchase 
 On June 11, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 40.0 million of shares of our common stock. Under the share repurchase program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase. The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and will be dependent on market conditions, liquidity, applicable securities laws, and other factors. We may suspend or discontinue the share repurchase program at any time. We plan on funding any repurchases in the future with our current cash and cash equivalents and future cash flows. 
 As of November 3, 2024, we had 36.6 million available to repurchase shares pursuant to the share repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 8 Stockholders' Equity in the notes to the condensed financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as of November 3, 2024, except for employment agreements entered in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Please see Note 1 to our financial statements included on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 4, 2024 for a complete description of our significant accounting policies. There have been no material changes to the significant accounting policies during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2024.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, contained in the Condensed Notes to Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a full description of the recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, that could affect our financial position and results of operations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held primarily in cash deposits and money market funds. The fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. 
 
 Interest on the revolving line of credit incurred pursuant to the credit agreements described herein would accrue at a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of occurrence; however, we do not expect that any changes in prevailing interest rates will have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 In the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, we saw inflationary pressures across various parts of our business and operations, including, but not limited to, wholesale cost inflation and rising costs across our supply chain. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. If our costs were to be subject to more significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases or other cost efficiency measures. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of November 3, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 3, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For information regarding our legal proceedings, see Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies , included in Part I, Item 1, Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this item by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 4, 2024. 
 We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves. 
 
 In June 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to purchase up to 40.0 million of our common stock from time to time. Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices or at all. Further, our share repurchases could affect the trading price of our common stock, increase its volatility, reduce the market liquidity for our stock and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a lower market valuation of our common stock. Repurchasing our common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased will depend on various factors, including the market price of our common stock, trading volume, general market conditions and other corporate and economic considerations. 
 
 Government regulation of the Internet and ecommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and ecommerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, ecommerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, consumer credit offerings, content protection, electronic contracts and communications (such as do not call/mail and text messaging requirements), consumer protection, use of artificial intelligence, Internet neutrality and gift cards. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or ecommerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet or ecommerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Additionally, we are subject to various federal, state and local consumer protection, pricing transparency and false advertising laws that regulate retailers and govern the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of merchandise, including California s Consumer Legal Remedies Act. 
 
 Though we seek at all times to be in full compliance with all such laws, we cannot be sure that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could damage our reputation and brand, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our website by consumers and result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations. In particular, we are subject to a putative class action lawsuit in California related to the Company s pricing. The complaint generally alleges that the Company falsely advertised discounts on certain products. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, an unspecified amount of monetary damages, including treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief related to the Company s sales practices, and attorneys fees, expert fees, and other expenses. Although we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against the claims asserted against us, we cannot predict the potential outcomes, cost and expenses associated with current and any future claims and lawsuits. Any damages, legal fees, or costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under any such laws could be material.

We are and may in the future be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention. 
 
 We are involved in and may in the future be subject to litigation or other disputes, which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the restatements, market price volatility or other factors. In particular, on December 19, 2023, a putative securities class action was filed against us and certain of our current and former officers in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut captioned Gutknecht v. The Lovesac Company , No. 3:23-cv-1640 to recover damages allegedly caused by violations of federal securities law in connection with the restatements. Additionally, three putative shareholder derivative actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf of the Company against certain of its current and former officers and directors. The cases assert claims on behalf of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of the Exchange Act, unjust enrichment, corporate waste, and aiding and abetting primary violations. Other potential plaintiffs may also file additional lawsuits in connection with the restatement. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. Additionally, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. As a result, we may be the target of securities class action litigation in the future. The defense or settlement of this litigation and any future litigation could be time-consuming and expensive, divert the attention of management away from our business, and, if any litigation is adversely resolved against us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any additional regulatory consequences, litigation, claim or dispute, whether successful or not, could subject us to additional costs, divert the attention of our management, or impair our reputation. Each of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We face risks related to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements and the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 As previously disclosed, we reached a determination to restate our financial statements as of and for the year ended January 29, 2023, and the unaudited condensed quarterly financial information for the quarterly periods ended April 30, 2023, October 30, 2022, July 31, 2022 and May 1, 2022. As a result, we voluntarily self-reported to the SEC information concerning the internal investigation of these accounting matters. As a result of self-reporting, the Company was the subject of a non-public investigation by the SEC. The Company cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation, and on October 29, 2024, the Company agreed to a settlement to resolve the claims against it. Without admitting or denying the SEC s allegations, we agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering us to pay a 1.5 million civil penalty and imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the associated rules thereunder. Additionally, while we believe we have made appropriate judgments in determining the errors and correct adjustments in preparing our restated financial statements, the SEC may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported these adjustments. Accordingly, there is a risk that we may have to further restate our historical financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC or take other actions not currently contemplated. We cannot assure that all of the risks and challenges described above will be eliminated or that general reputational harm will not persist. If one or more of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 As a result of the restatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. We expect to continue to face many of the risks and challenges related to the restatement. Specifically, we are involved in and may in the future be subject to additional litigation or other disputes, which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the restatement. In particular, on December 19, 2023, a putative securities class action was filed against us and certain of our current and former officers in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut captioned Gutknecht v. The Lovesac Company , No. 3:23-cv-1640 to recover damages allegedly caused by violations of federal securities law in connection with the restatements. Additionally, three putative shareholder derivative actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf of the Company against certain of its current and former officers and directors. The cases assert claims on behalf of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of the Exchange Act, unjust enrichment, corporate waste, and aiding and abetting primary violations. Other potential plaintiffs may also file additional lawsuits in connection with the restatement. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. The defense or settlement of this litigation and any future additional litigation could be time-consuming and expensive, divert the attention of management away from our business, and, if any litigation is adversely resolved against us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any additional regulatory consequences, litigation, claim or dispute, whether successful or not, could subject us to additional costs, divert the attention of our management, or impair our reputation. Each of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
