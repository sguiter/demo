 Capacity Total Electric Operations sales Coal operations Customers in Florida, North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia Total Coal Operations sales Performance Obligations Electric operations We concluded that each megawatt-hour MWh of delivered energy is capable of being distinct as a customer could benefit from each on its own by using/consuming it as a part of its operations. We also concluded that the stand-ready obligation to be available to provide electricity is capable of being distinct as each unit of capacity provides an economic benefit to the holder and could be sold by the customer. During 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement APA with Hoosier Hoosier APA in which Hallador Power shall sell, and Hoosier shall buy, delivered energy quantities through 2025 at the contract price, which is per MWh. We have remaining delivered energy obligations to Hoosier on the APA totaling million through 2025 as of September 30, 2024 . The agreement was amended August 31, 2023, to extend through 2028 . The amendment included additional obligations to Hoosier of million, or per MWh, as of September 30, 2024 . In addition to delivered energy, under the Hoosier APA, Hallador Power shall provide a stand-ready obligation to provide electricity to MISO, also known as contract capacity. The contract capacity that Hallador Power shall provide to Hoosier is megawatts MW for contract year one, and on average MW for contract years two to four. Hoosier shall pay Hallador Power the capacity price of per kilowatt month for the contract capacity.

We have energy and capacity obligations to customers, excluding the Hoosier APA, through 2029 totaling million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 . We have million and million of deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 , related to the prepaid physically delivered power contract and other capacity obligations outside of the Hoosier APA, respectively. Coal operations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to provide distinct goods or services. Performance obligations are the unit of account for purposes of applying the revenue recognition standard and therefore determine when and how revenue is recognized. In most of our coal contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide coal that meets certain quality criteria. We consider each ton of coal a separate performance obligation and allocate the transaction price based on the base price per the contract, increased or decreased for quality adjustments. We recognize revenue at a point in time as the customer does not have control over the asset at any point during the fulfillment of the contract. For substantially all our customers, this is supported by the fact that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer upon loading of the truck or railcar at the mine. This is also the point at which physical possession of the coal transfers to the customer, as well as the right to receive substantially all benefits and the risk of loss in ownership of the coal. We have remaining coal sales performance obligations relating to fixed priced contracts to third-party customers of approximately million, which represents the average fixed prices on our committed contracts as of September 30, 2024. We expect to recognize approximately of this coal sales revenue in 2024 , with the remainder recognized through 2028 . We have remaining volume performance obligations relating to coal contracts with price reopeners of million tons million tons in 2025, 2026 and 2027 as of September 30, 2024. The coal tons used to determine the remaining performance obligations are subject to adjustment in instances of force majeure and exercise of customer options to either take additional tons or reduce tonnage if such an option exists in the customer contract. Contract Balances Under ASC 606, the timing of when a performance obligation is satisfied can affect the presentation of accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities. The main distinction between accounts receivable and contract assets is whether consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is an entity s right to consideration that is unconditional. Under the typical payment terms of our contracts with customers, the customer pays us a base price for the coal, increased or decreased for any quality adjustments, electricity, or capacity. Amounts billed and due are recorded as trade accounts receivable and included in accounts receivable in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of January 1, 2023, accounts receivable for coal sales billed to customers was million. and ~ , respectively. Historically, our actual effective tax rates have differed from the statutory effective rate primarily due to the benefit received from statutory percentage depletion in excess of tax basis. The deduction for statutory percentage depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in income (loss) before income taxes.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION UPDATES THE MD A SECTION OF OUR 2023 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION THEREWITH. Hallador Energy made significant progress in its transformation to an Independent Power Producer this quarter by signing a non-binding term sheet Term Sheet with a leading global data center developer. Our team is working diligently to finalize definitive agreements with this partner and relevant utilities that will support the delivery of our in front of the meter energy and capacity to the large hyperscaler. As we have discussed before, these types of deals are complex arrangements involving multiple parties. If we reach definitive agreements, we will have contracted large portions of our plant s energy and capacity at much improved margins for more than a decade to come. The completion of the transaction contemplated by the Term Sheet is subject to, among other matters, the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and there can be no assurance that definitive agreements will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently contemplated, or at all. The path to this type of long-term, higher margin transaction has been focused and deliberate. While we have not yet reached a binding agreement, we are encouraged both by the relationship with our current partner and the heavy interest that we continue to see from alternative counterparties in our energy and capacity offerings. This continued interest highlights the supply shortage in accredited capacity that we believe the MISO market is experiencing and provides the Company options in the event that we are unable to reach agreement in connection with the executed Term Sheet. We believe accredited capacity in MISO continues to increase in value and demand, particularly in our sales region of MISO Zone 6, an area that includes Indiana and a portion of western Kentucky. This is important to Hallador based on our belief that Hallador has a significant amount of the remaining unsold accredited capacity in MISO Zone 6 over the next few years. Our current belief is guided by several factors, including: Demand for power is growing at the fastest rate in several decades due to new demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and onshoring of industry. Indiana is seeing consistent interest from data center developers, likely due to favorable Indiana tax law for datacenter development and a pro-business climate. Supply Response is Restricted: o MISO has significantly reduced the capacity accreditation it awards to wind and solar generation (non-dispatchable), making it challenging to support accredited capacity needs from generating resources other than coal, U.S. natural gas Gas ), and nuclear (dispatchable). o We are currently seeing minimal supply response of accredited capacity which we believe relates to the regulatory and environmental challenges for all types of baseload generation, including Gas. Additionally, we believe the muted supply response is exacerbated by the glut of solar and wind projects, which provide minimal accredited capacity, overwhelming the queue and delaying access to dispatchable generation projects that would supplement the supply of accredited capacity. While our data center PPA negotiations proceed, we continue to focus on improving our balance sheet and access to liquidity. During the quarter we modified our credit facility to provide the Company with short-term covenant relief to pursue additional liquidity. Subsequent to the quarter, we executed a prepaid forward power sale in the amount of 60.0 million (see Item 1. Footnote 21 - Subsequent Events ), delivering power from June 2025 through December 2026. A portion of the proceeds were used to pay down 20.0 million on our Term Loan, which satisfies our January 2025, April 2025, July 2025 and a portion of our October 2025 required quarterly Term Loan payments. Our October 2025 required quarterly Term Loan payment is reduced to 6.0 million as part of the 20.0 million Term Loan pay down. We also paid 34.0 million on our revolver. We did not utilize the ATM in the third quarter.

 Quarter-over-Quarter our financial results improved. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Hallador Power, generated 1,074,000 MWh during the quarter versus 780,000 MWh in the second quarter of 2024. This is a result of stronger power pricing during the quarter and a significant decrease in Gas inventory levels against the imbalances we saw in the first half of the year. As Gas inventory decreased and prices increased, coal generation s position in the dispatch stack improved. During the third quarter of 2024, our power plant operated more frequently than in the second quarter of 2024, partly due to having no planned maintenance, and as a result, our costs at the plant improved to 44.42 per MWh from 62.98 per MWh. During the third quarter, results at our Sunrise Coal subsidiary also improved in connection with the restructuring of our mining division that we undertook beginning in the first quarter of 2024 (see Item 1. Footnote 16 Organizational Restructuring ). In July of 2024, we completed a project for four of our most productive units, which allowed all units to be on a split air system, which helped to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs at the mine to 66.43 per ton produced, a decrease of 1.59 from the second quarter of 2024. Sunrise Coal entered into a third-party coal contract to provide 2.5 million tons of coal from January 2026 to December 31, 2028, at an average price of 57.60 per ton. Our goal is for Hallador Power to generate approximately 1,500,000 MWh on a quarterly basis, which equates to approximately 6,000,000 MWh annually (see Hallador Power s capacity and utilization information below). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Hallador Power generated 2,670,000 MWh, or 59.3 of our target. During the first nine months of the year, we experienced sales prices of nearly 261.00 per MWh for limited times, balanced against several days of pricing below our variable cost to produce. These fluctuations led to an inconsistent dispatch schedule.

Nameplate capacity for the Merom Power Plant refers to the maximum electric output generated by the plant in the period presented and may not reflect actual production. Actual production each period varies based on weather conditions, operational conditions, and other factors. (ii). Accredited capacity is based on MISO s average seasonal accreditations for the year. Average seasonal accreditations were 769 MW and 838 MW per day for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accreditations are weighted and adjusted annually based on 3-year rolling performance metrics. (iii). Accredited capacity utilization is measured as power produced (MWh) divided by accredited capacity for the period (MW) multiplied by 24 times the number of days for the period. When forward selling Capacity, we target annual sales of around 65.0 million to offset our fixed annual costs at the plant of approximately 60.0 million. We have already sold a large portion of our near term Capacity, which we believe makes our forward Capacity sales goals attainable as illustrated in our Solid Forward Sales Position table below. In addition to the Term Sheet discussed above, which is not included in the graph below, our forward contracted energy sales position has a significant price increase in future years as illustrated in the graph below.

 To match Sunrise s production levels and cost structure to that of the market demands, we restructured Sunrise operations in the first quarter of 2024. As we have previously noted, the restructuring included a reduction in force RIF of approximately 110 people in February, and we have since allowed attrition to further reduce our workforce by approximately 140 additional people, a total workforce reduction of more than 25 . We also restructured our operations to focus on our more profitable units and to idle units with higher production costs. Transitioning our Oaktown mining facilities from 7 units of production to 4 units of production was a deliberate process which took considerable time and effort, and was completed in mid-July. We are encouraged by the early results of Sunrise s restructuring and have seen improvement in mining costs since we made the decision to adjust our operations. The Company last reviewed its long-lived assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2023 and concluded no impairment was indicated. In preparing the Company s impairment analysis, it utilizes undiscounted net cash flows over the expected life of the long-lived asset based upon anticipated production along with contracted and forward prices as well as historical operating expenses adjusted for inflation. This cash flow analysis is largely dependent upon the operating plans of the Company, which are reviewed by the Company and its Board of Directors no less than annually, normally during the fourth quarter of each year. Changes in anticipated activity levels, pricing or operating expenses can have significant effects on the ultimate value of the undiscounted cash flow analysis. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company began a review of our mining assets and our future mining plans. This review will continue through the fourth quarter of 2024. Should the anticipated future mining activity be reduced, an impairment of our mining assets could occur. The amount of any such potential impairment, if any, is not currently estimable and will ultimately be based upon the finalized operating plans of the Company as approved by its Board of Directors, market driven pricing and cost trends, which are not known at this time. Nevertheless, the carrying amount of the Company s mining assets is material to its condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and any future impairment of such assets could therefore be material. The Company has concluded that no impairment exists as of September 30, 2024 as no triggering events have occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024. Our condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with this discussion. This analysis includes a discussion of metrics on a per mega-watt hour (MWh) and a per ton basis as derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are considered non-GAAP measurements. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability.

 2024 vs. 2023 (third quarter) Revenues from electric operations increased 4.4 million, or 6.5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. While the Merom Facility ran less hours in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, the contracted hours were at higher prices. We have new delivered energy contracts and capacity contracts with sales starting in 2024. We entered into three new delivered energy contracts during the current year which increased revenues by 20.9 million. We entered into three capacity contracts during 2023 that began delivery in 2024 and one new capacity contract that we entered into during the current year, which increased revenues by 10.9 million. Revenue increases from new contracts were offset by suppressed MISO pricing (~66 of total energy hours at the Merom node being priced below our production cost at our Merom Facility), and reductions in demand for Power and higher demand for Gas as Gas inventories remained high, with a continued decline in average spot pricing per MBtu of 2.11 compared to 2.59 during the same three-month period in 2023. Fuel decreased 21.1 million, or 41.6 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our MWh sold decreased by 124 MWh, or 9.5 , from the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in fuel costs are primarily related to our decreased electricity sales and declines in coal market pricing. We used 0.1 million less tons of coal in our electric production compared to the third quarter of 2023. The average purchase price per ton of coal used in the plant on a segment basis, was 53.33 in the third quarter of 2024, decreasing from 76.94 per ton in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of purchased power was 3.1 million during the third quarter of 2024. As noted above, when energy hours at the Merom Hub are priced below our production cost at our Merom Facility, we make net hourly purchases of power in the MISO market. Income from operations increased 22.0 million, or 823.3 , and increased 18.39 per MWh, from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The main drivers of this change in income from operations are described in the discussion above. 2024 vs. 2023 (nine months) Delivered energy revenues from electric operations decreased 37.3 million, or 20.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to suppressed MISO pricing (~75 of total energy hours at the Merom Hub being priced below our production cost at our Merom Facility), reductions in demand for Power and higher demand for Gas as Gas inventories remained high with a continued decline in average spot pricing per MBtu of 2.11 compared to 2.47 during the same nine-month period in 2023. Fuel decreased 70.5 million, or 48.0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Production decreased by 942 MWh, or 26.1 , from the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in fuel costs are due to the expiration of a coal purchase contract in June of 2023 and declines in coal market pricing. We used 0.5 million less tons of coal in our electric production compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average purchase price per ton of coal used in the plant on a segment basis, was 54.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing from 62.37 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As discussed above, average spot prices for Gas were down per MMBtu decreasing the demand for Electric Power. Cost of purchased power was 7.7 million during the first nine months of 2024. As noted above, when energy hours at the Merom Hub are priced below our production cost at our Merom Facility, we make net hourly purchases of power in the MISO market. Other operating and maintenance costs increased 9.3 million, or 56.0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to our planned maintenance outage during the second quarter of 2024 which resulted in 7.0 million in additional costs for the period. Income from operations increased 16.1 million, or 63.7 , and increased 7.23 per MWh, from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The main drivers of this change in income from operations are described in the discussion above.

Consolidated operating revenues from coal operations decreased 65.2 million, or 66.6 , from the third quarter of 2023. These declines were due to reductions in volume and average sales price for our coal. Our average sales price, on a segment basis, decreased 12.40 per ton and we sold 1.1 million tons less compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our average sales price on a consolidated basis decreased 7.91 per ton and we sold 1.0 million tons less compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating revenues for the third quarter of 2024 include 16.7 million in sales to the Merom plant which were eliminated in the consolidation. Other operating and maintenance costs decreased 32.7 million, or 54.7 , and labor decreased 10.6 million, or 35.3 , from the third quarter of 2023. These changes were driven by impacts from the Reorganization Plan disclosed in Item 1. Note 16 Organizational Restructuring to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. During the third quarter 2024, underground costs such as roof support and belt maintenance, fuel and utilities, as well as maintenance costs all had significant decreases in comparison to the third quarter of 2023. We produced 0.7 million tons less in the third quarter of 2024 than the third quarter of 2023.

 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization decreased 2.5 million, or 21.7 , from the third quarter of 2023 due to decreases in coal production and the remaining useful lives of the mine development assets. Income (loss) from operations decreased 36.9 million, or 149.2 , and decreased 25.22 per ton, from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The main drivers of this change in income (loss) from operations are described in the discussion above. 2024 vs. 2023 (nine months) Segment operating revenues from coal operations decreased 180.6 million, or 52.6 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated operating revenues from coal operations decreased 166.0 million, or 58.7 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These declines were due to reductions in volume and average sales price for our coal. Our average sales price, on a segment basis, decreased 8.45 per ton and we sold 2.5 million tons less compared to the first nine months of 2023. Our average sales price, on a consolidated basis, for the first nine months of 2024, decreased 4.63 per ton and we sold 2.6 million tons less compared to the first nine months of 2023. Other operating and maintenance costs decreased 42.5 million, or 34.6 , and labor decreased 24.6 million, or 27.1 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These changes were driven by the Reorganization Plan disclosed in Item 1. Note 16 Organizational Restructuring to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. During the first nine months of 2024, we produced 2.3 million tons less on a segment basis than the first nine months of 2023. Additionally, we went from 5 mines producing to 1 mine producing and reduced our coal employee headcount by 313 employees as part of the Reorganization Plan. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization decreased 8.6 million, or 23.0 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreases in coal production and the remaining useful lives of the mine development assets. Income (loss) from operations decreased 99.2 million, or 154.4 , and decreased 23.45 per ton, from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The main drivers of this change in income from operations are described in the discussion above. Quarterly coal sales and cost data on a segment basis are as follows (in thousands, except per ton data and wash plant recovery percentage):

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate based upon projected annual income (loss), forecasted permanent tax differences, discrete items, and statutory rates in states in which we operate. Our ETR differs from the statutory rate due primarily to statutory depletion in excess of tax basis and changes in the valuation allowance. The deduction for statutory percentage depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in income (loss) before income taxes. RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 9 - Stock Compensation Plans for a discussion of RSUs. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We believe that the estimates of coal reserves, asset retirement obligation liabilities, deferred tax accounts, valuation of inventory, and the estimates used in impairment analysis are our critical accounting estimates. The reserve estimates are used in the depreciation, depletion, and amortization calculations and our internal cash flow projections. If these estimates turn out to be materially under or over-stated, our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and impairment test may be affected. The process of estimating reserves is complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve estimates are prepared by professional engineers, both internal and external, and are subject to change over time as more data becomes available. Changes in the reserves estimates from the prior year were nominal. SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that surface disturbance be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans. SMCRA requires us to restore affected surface areas to approximate the original contours as contemporaneously as practicable with the completion of surface mining operations. Federal law and some states impose on mine operators the responsibility for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of longwall mining and possibly other mining operations. Obligations are reflected at the present value of their future cash flows. We reflect accretion of the obligations for the period from the date they are incurred through the date they are extinguished. The ARO assets are amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable (proven and probable) reserves. We use credit-adjusted risk-free discount rates ranging from 7 to 10 to discount the obligation, inflation rates anticipated during the time to reclamation, and cost estimates prepared by its engineers inclusive of market risk premiums. Activities include reclamation of pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at underground mines, and reclamation of refuse areas and slurry ponds.

Table of Contents 
 Accretion expense is recognized on the obligation through the expected settlement date. On at least an annual basis, we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities, changes in the timing and extent of reclamation activities, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions, to reflect current experience. Any difference between the recorded amount of the liability and the actual cost of reclamation will be recognized as a gain or loss when the obligation is settled. We have analyzed our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We identified our federal tax return and our Indiana state tax return as major tax jurisdictions. We believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our consolidated financial position. We have not taken any significant uncertain tax positions, and our tax provisions and returns are prepared by a large public accounting firm with significant experience in energy related industries. Changes to the estimates from reported amounts in the prior year were not significant. Inventory is valued at a lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). Anticipated utilization of low sulfur, higher-cost coal from our Freelandville, and Prosperity mines has the potential to create NRV adjustments as our estimated needs change. The NRV adjustments are subject to change as our costs may fluctuate due to higher or lower production and our NRV may fluctuate based on sales contracts we enter into from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, coal inventory includes NRV adjustments of 1.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively. Long-lived assets used in operations are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. For impairment assessments, management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The determination of the lowest level of cash flows is largely based on nature of production, common infrastructure, common sales points, common regulation and management oversight to make such determinations. These determinations could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment. This cash flow analysis is largely dependent upon the operating plans of the Company, which are reviewed by the Company and its Board of Directors no less than annually, normally during the 4 th quarter of each year. Changes in anticipated activity levels, pricing or operating expenses can have significant effects on the ultimate value of the undiscounted cash flow analysis. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company began a review of its Oaktown mining facilities and future mining plan related to this complex. This review will continue through the fourth quarter of 2024. Should the anticipated future mining activity related to the Company s Oaktown mining facilities be reduced, an impairment of certain mining assets could occur. The amount of any such potential impairment, if any, is not currently estimable and will ultimately be based upon the finalized operating plans of the Company as approved by its Board of Directors, market driven pricing and cost trends, which are not known at this time. Nevertheless, the carrying amount of the Company s mining assets is material to its condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and any future impairment of such assets could therefore be material.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DISCLOSURE CONTROLS We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our CEO and CFO and as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

Exhibit 95.1 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Our principles at Sunrise Coal LLC are safety, honesty, and compliance. We firmly believe that these values compose a dedicated workforce and with that, come high production. The core to this is our strong training programs that include accident prevention, workplace inspection and examination, emergency response and compliance. We work with the Federal and State regulatory agencies to help eliminate safety and health hazards from our workplace and increase safety and compliance awareness throughout the mining industry. We are regulated by the Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 Mine Act ). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. We present information below regarding certain violations which MSHA has issued with respect to our mines. While assessing this information please consider that the number and cost of violations will vary depending on the MSHA inspector and can be contested and appealed, and in that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The disclosures listed below are provided pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. We believe that the following disclosures comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act; however, it is possible that future SEC rule making may require disclosures to be filed in a different format than the following. The table that follows outlines required disclosures and citations/orders issued to us by MSHA during the 3 rd quarter 2024. The citations and orders outlined below may differ from MSHA`s data retrieval system due to timing, special assessed citations, and other factors. Definitions: Section 104(a) Significant and Substantial Citations S S : An alleged violation of a mining safety or health standard or regulation where there exists a reasonable likelihood that the hazard outlined will result in an injury or illness of a serious nature. Section 104(b) Orders: Failure to abate a 104(a) citation within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. The result of which is an order of immediate withdraw of non-essential persons from the affected area until MSHA determines the violation has been corrected. Section 104(d) Citations and Orders: An alleged unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health and safety standards. Section 107(a) Orders: An order of withdrawal for situations where MSHA has determined that an imminent danger exists. Section 110(b)(2) Violations: An alleged flagrant violation issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act.
