and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are not historical facts, and involve risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements
of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in the Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the Company s financial position, business strategy
and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, events or developments which the Company expects or anticipates will
or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof); expansion
and growth of the Company's business and operations; and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are based
on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions
and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual
results or developments will conform with the Company's expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
including general economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and
pursued by the Company; changes in laws or regulation; and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of the Company. 

These forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as believes, anticipates, 
 expects, estimates, plans, may, will, or similar terms. These statements
appear in a number of places in this filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company,
and its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company's financial condition or results
of operations for its limited history; (ii) the Company's business and growth strategies; and, (iii) the Company's financing plans. Investors
are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties,
and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such
factors that could adversely affect actual results and performance include, but are not limited to, the Company's limited operating history,
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and expenses, government regulation, technological change and competition. For information
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements,
please refer to our filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the Risk Factors
section of the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 04, 2024.

actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the
expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no obligations to update any such
forward-looking statements.

Malaysia 

The income tax provision in respect of operations
in Malaysia is calculated at the applicable tax rates on the taxable income for the periods based on existing legislation, interpretations,
and practices. The principal legislation that governs a person s income tax in Malaysia is the Income Tax Act 1967 (the ITA ).
The regulatory body implementing and enforcing the ITA is the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia. Pursuant to Section 3 of the ITA, income
tax shall be charged for each year of assessment upon the income of any person accruing in or derived from Malaysia or received in Malaysia
from outside Malaysia. 

Under the ITA, enterprises incorporated in Malaysia
are usually subject to a unified 24 enterprise income tax rate while preferential tax rates, tax holidays, and tax exemptions may be
granted on a case-by-case basis. The tax rate for small and medium sized companies (generally companies incorporated in Malaysia with
paid-in capital of MYR2,500,000 or less, and gross income of not more than MYR50 million) is 17 for the first MYR600,000 (or approximately
 150,000), with the remaining balance being taxed at the 24 rate.

addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues
which are provided by us and audited by our auditor, and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any acquisition
of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB400 million. Currently, these statements
and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operations, or the ability to accept foreign investments and list our
securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain
how soon legislative or administrative regulation-making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed
implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations
will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on a U.S. or other foreign
exchange. 

Further, in light of the
recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong s national security, the promulgation
of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and
anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject to the risks of the uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard,
including the risk that we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, that applicable laws, regulations or interpretations
change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, which may result in a material change in our operations, including
our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or
continue to offer securities to our investors, and the resulting adverse change in value to our common stock. We may also be subject to
penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to
comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company s securities to continue to trade
on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For
a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and the offering associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to Risk
Factors Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong . set forth in the 10-K.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act ), as of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive
officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), who concluded, that (i) there continues to be material weaknesses
in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, that the weaknesses constitute a deficiency and that
this deficiency could result in misstatements of the foregoing accounts and disclosures that could result in a material misstatement to
the financial statements for the period covered by this report that would not be detected, and (ii) accordingly, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

However, it should be noted
that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonable
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
