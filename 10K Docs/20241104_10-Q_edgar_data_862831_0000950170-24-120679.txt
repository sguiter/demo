 at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had a position in investment securities with a fair value of million and a total unrealized loss of million that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. At September 30, 2024 , there were a total of securities positions in the Company s investment portfolio with a fair value of thousand and a total unrealized loss of less than thousand that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had a position in investment securities with a fair value of million and a total unrealized loss of million that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. At December 31, 2023 , there were a total of securities positions in the Company s investment portfolio with a fair value of thousand and a total unrealized loss of less than thousand that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months. The unrealized loss on investment securities was predominantly caused by changes in market interest rates subsequent to purchase. The fair value of the Company s portfolio fluctuates as market interest rates change. Securities Available for Sale As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , al lowance for credit losses had been recognized on AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities were impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available for sale securities and in consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Furthermore, the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of its investments and more than likely will not need to sell before the recovery period for operating purposes, with no impairment identified. As the portfolio is managed from a liquidity, earnings, and risk standpoint, sales from the AFS portfolio may be warranted based upon prevailing market factors. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Securities Held to Maturity The Company s HTM investment securities include debt securities that are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as risk free, and have a long history of zero credit loss. In addition, the Company s HTM investment securities include debt securities that are issued by state and local government agencies, or municipal bonds. The Company monitors the credit quality of our municipal bonds through the use of a credit rating agency or by ratings that are derived by an internal scoring model. The scoring methodology for the internally derived ratings is based on a series of financial ratios for the municipality being reviewed as compared to typical industry figures. This information is used to determine the financial strengths and weaknesses of the municipality, which is indicated with a numeric rating. This number is then converted into a letter rating to better match the system used by the credit rating agencies. As of September 30, 2024 , million of our municipal bonds were rated as an equivalent to Standard Poor s A/AA/AAA, with million internally rated to be the equivalent of Standard Poor s A/AA/AAA rating. Additionally, no municipal bonds were rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2023 , million of our municipal bonds were rated as an equivalent to Standard Poor s A/AA/AAA, with million internally rated to be the equivalent of Standard Poor s A/AA/AAA rating, and no municipal bonds were rated below investment grade. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had past due or nonaccrual held to maturity investment securities.

There were thousand and thousand in consumer overdrafts which were past due greater than 90 days as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Consumer overdrafts are overdrawn deposit accounts which have been reclassified as loans but by their terms do not accrue interest. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded using the cash basis method of accounting. There was interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Estimated interest income of thousand and thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, would have been recorded if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms. Loan Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty Loans may be modified when it is determined that a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Loan modifications may include principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, and term extensions, or a combination of these concessions.

Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors such as the fair value of collateral. The Company analyzes commercial business and commercial mortgage loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. Risk ratings are updated any time the situation warrants. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company s credit position at some future date. Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans that do not meet the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the process described above are considered uncriticized or pass-rated loans and are included in groups of homogeneous loans with similar risk and loss characteristics.

The sale resulted in a million reduction in the carrying amount of goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1st. The Company did not identify an indication of goodwill impairment for any of its reporting units during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s borrowings. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that million in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. Interest Rate Swaps The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. These interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. Credit-risk-related Contingent Features The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain one or more of the following provisions: (a) if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including a default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations, and (b) if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.

Standby letters of credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses which may require payment of a fee. Commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Unfunded Commitments At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments totaled million and million , respectively, and was included in other liabilities on the Company s consolidated statements of financial condition.

 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of or during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments The assumptions used below are expected to approximate those that market participants would use in valuing these financial instruments. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument, including estimates of timing, amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer. Such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses. In some cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the immediate settlement of the financial instrument. Care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about our business, its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for cash and cash equivalents, Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank FRB stock, accrued interest receivable, non-maturity deposits, short-term borrowings and accrued interest payable. Fair value estimates for other financial instruments not included elsewhere in this disclosure are discussed below. Securities held to maturity: The fair value of the Company s investment securities held to maturity is primarily measured using information from a third-party pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. Loans: The fair value of the Company s loans was estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans would be made for the same remaining maturities. Loans were first segregated by type, such as commercial, residential mortgage, and consumer, and were then further segmented into fixed and variable rate and loan quality categories. Expected future cash flows were projected based on contractual cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments. Time deposits: The fair value of time deposits was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach that applies prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity instruments. The fair values of the Company s time deposit liabilities do not take into consideration the value of the Company s long-term relationships with depositors, which may have significant value. Long-term borrowings: Long-term borrowings consist of million of subordinated notes and million of long-term borrowings from the FHLB. The subordinated notes are publicly traded and are valued based on market prices, which are characterized as Level 2 liabilities in the fair value hierarchy. The FHLB borrowings are valued using discounted cash flows based on current market rates for borrowings with similar remaining maturities and are characterized as Level 2 liabilities in the fair value hierarchy.

 GENERAL 
 The Parent is a financial holding company headquartered in New York State, providing diversified financial services through its operating subsidiaries, Five Star Bank (the Bank and Courier Capital, LLC Courier Capital ). The Company offers a broad array of deposit, lending and other financial services to individuals, municipalities and businesses in Western and Central New York through its wholly owned New York-chartered banking subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank also has commercial loan production offices in Ellicott City (Baltimore), Maryland, and Syracuse, New York, serving the Mid-Atlantic and Central New York regions. Our indirect lending network includes relationships with franchised automobile dealers in Western and Central New York, and the Capital District of New York. Effective January 1, 2024, we exited the Pennsylvania automobile market to align our focus more fully around our core Upstate New York market. Courier Capital provides customized investment advice, wealth management, investment consulting and retirement plan services to individuals, businesses, institutions, foundations and retirement plans. 
 On April 1, 2024, the Company announced and closed the sale of the assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, SDN Insurance Agency, LLC SDN ), which provided a broad range of insurance services to personal and business clients, to NFP Property Casualty Services, Inc. NFP ), a subsidiary of NFP Corp. The sale generated 27 million in proceeds, or a pre-tax gain of 13.7 million, after selling costs, of which 13.5 million was recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The all-cash transaction value represented approximately four times our 2023 insurance revenue. Following the sale of the assets of SDN, we changed the name of the entity to Five Star Advisors LLC and expect to utilize it to serve as a conduit to refer insurance business to NFP. 
 Our primary sources of revenue are net interest income (interest earned on our loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and other funding sources) and noninterest income, particularly investment advisory and financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits, fees and other revenue from insurance, prior to the sale of the assets of SDN. Business volumes and pricing drive revenue potential, and tend to be influenced by overall economic factors, including market interest rates, business spending, consumer confidence, economic growth, and competitive conditions within the marketplace. We are not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations with certainty and our asset/liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate changes from having a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition. 
 48 

Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Our business strategy has been to maintain a community bank philosophy, which consists of focusing on and understanding the individualized banking and other financial needs of individuals, municipalities and businesses of the communities surrounding our primary service area. We believe this focus allows us to be more responsive to our customers needs and provide a high level of personal service that differentiates us from larger competitors, resulting in long-standing and broad-based banking relationships. Our core customers are primarily small- to medium-sized businesses, individuals and community organizations who prefer to build banking and wealth management relationships with a community bank that combines high quality, competitively priced products and services with personalized service. Because of our identity and origin as a locally operated bank, we believe that our level of personal service provides a competitive advantage over larger banks, which tend to consolidate decision-making authority outside local communities. 
 A key aspect of our current business strategy is to foster a community-oriented culture where our customers and employees establish long-standing and mutually beneficial relationships. We believe that we are well-positioned to be a strong competitor within our market area because of our focus on community banking needs and customer service, our comprehensive suite of deposit, loan, and wealth management products typically found at larger banks, our highly experienced management team and our strategically located banking centers. 
 We prioritize customer acquisition through cost-effective, high-demand digital, virtual and physical channels, while maintaining a community bank distinctiveness relative to larger banks and digital-only neobanks. We leverage the retail branch network and customer contact center to build trust and credibility, provide personal financial education and advice, offer convenience, and bridge digital and physical channels. Our enhanced digital capabilities complement a continued focus on a consistent customer experience and engagement across physical and virtual channels, including using branches to create deeper engagement and relationships with customers, balancing customer engagement with efficiency opportunities (e.g., framing outreach to the customer contact center to teach customers how to use digital channels, in addition to addressing the reason for the call), and maintaining and expanding our customer reach digitally, physically or virtually. By employing digital channels across our current products and services, we deepen existing relationships and enter new geographies or market segments that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive targets using traditional approaches. Deepening our existing digital capabilities allows us to capitalize on a shift in customer preferences away from physical branches. On September 16, 2024, we announced our intent to begin an orderly wind down of our BaaS offerings, following a careful review by the Company s executive management and Board of Directors undertaken in conjunction with its annual strategic planning process. 
 We have evolved to meet changing customer needs by offering complementary physical, digital and virtual channels. We focus on technology to provide solutions that fit our customers preferences for transacting business with us. Branches are staffed by certified personal bankers who are trained to meet a broad array of customer needs. Our digital banking capabilities, interactive teller machine ITM functionality and Customer Contact Center provide additional self-serve and phone options through which customer needs are met effectively. 
 We will continue to explore market expansion opportunities that complement current market areas as opportunities arise. Our primary focus will be on increasing the Bank s market share within existing markets, while taking advantage of potential growth opportunities within our noninterest income lines of business by acquiring businesses that can be incorporated into existing operations. We believe our capital position remains strong enough to support an active merger and acquisition strategy and the expansion of our core financial service businesses. Consequently, we continue to explore acquisition opportunities in these activities. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we will balance the potential for earnings accretion with maintaining adequate capital levels, which could result in our common stock being the predominant form of consideration and/or the need for us to raise capital. 
 Conversations with potential strategic partners occur on a regular basis. The evaluation of any potential opportunity will favor a transaction that complements our core competencies and strategic intent, with a lesser emphasis being placed on geographic location or size. Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining a diversified revenue stream. Our senior management team has experience in acquisitions and post-acquisition integration of operations and is prepared to act promptly should a potential opportunity arise but will remain disciplined with its approach. We believe this experience positions us to successfully acquire and integrate additional financial services and banking businesses. 
 Cannabis Banking 
 The Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act was signed into law on March 31, 2021, legalizing the possession and sale of recreational marijuana in New York State for adults aged 21 or older and the state has issued adult-use cannabis cultivation, processing and retail dispensary licenses. We have implemented a program to provide financial products and services to legal cannabis-related businesses and partner with other financial institutions who provide such services. 
 49 

Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Offering financial products and services to the cannabis industry presents a unique set of regulatory risks due to the conflict between state and federal laws, as marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. In January 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ rescinded the Cole Memo and related memoranda which characterized the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against persons and entities complying with state regulatory systems permitting the use, manufacture and sale of medical marijuana as an inefficient use of their prosecutorial resources and discretion. The impact of the DOJ s rescission of the Cole Memo and related memoranda is unclear, but in the future may result in increased enforcement actions against the regulated cannabis industry generally. More recently, the United States Attorney General has indicated that the DOJ, under his leadership, does not intend to pursue cases against parties who comply with the laws in states which have legalized and are effectively regulating marijuana. However, enforcement policies and practices may be highly variable between political administrations. In addition, federal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutor for any district in which we operate will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis. In the future, enforcement actions may be taken against cannabis-related businesses or financial services providers that are viewed as aiding and abetting such activities. 
 The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN published guidelines in 2014 for financial institutions servicing state-legal cannabis businesses. These guidelines were issued for the explicit purpose so that financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses in a manner consistent with their obligations to know their customers and to report possible criminal activity. The Bank has and will continue to follow this and other FinCEN guidance in the areas of cannabis banking. 
 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 Recent Events 
 On September 16, 2024, we announced our intent to begin an orderly wind down of our BaaS offerings, following a careful review by the executive management and Board of Directors undertaken in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process. As of September 30, 2024, deposits and loans related to the Bank s BaaS offerings totaled 103 million and 29 million, respectively. We continue to preliminarily target completion of the wind down sometime in 2025. 
 Summary of 2024 Third Quarter Results 
 Net income decreased 556 thousand to 13.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 14.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was 13.1 million, or 0.84 per diluted share, compared with 13.7 million, or 0.88 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Return on average common equity was 11.18 and return on average assets was 0.89 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 13.15 and 0.92 , respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 results included 384 thousand of professional services expenses attributed to the deposit-related fraud event disclosed in March 2024 that occurred in the first quarter of 2024. We continue to aggressively pursue our legal rights and seek any and all recovery avenues to minimize the fraud loss. 
 Net interest income totaled 40.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 1.0 million compared to 41.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 were 92.4 million lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to an 83.5 million decrease in average investment securities, and a 13.2 million decrease in the average balance of Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially offset by a 4.3 million increase in average loans. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 were 27.2 million lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to a 93.4 million decrease in average borrowings, a 75.2 million decrease in average interest-bearing demand deposits and a 48.3 million decrease in average time deposits, partially offset by a 189.7 million increase in average savings and money market account deposits. 
 Net interest margin was 2.89 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.91 in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher funding costs amid the current high interest rate environment, offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. 
 The provision for credit losses was 3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 1.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a combination of factors, including a slight increase in the national unemployment forecast and higher qualitative factors overall, partially offset by a lower loan balance. Net charge-offs during the recent quarter were 1.7 million, representing 0.15 of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to 1.6 million, or an annualized 0.14 of average loans, in the third quarter of 2023. See the Allowance for Credit Losses Loans and Non-Performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans sections of this Management s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion regarding the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. 
 Noninterest income totaled 9.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 10.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The sale of the assets of our insurance subsidiary in April 2024 resulted in a decrease in insurance income of 1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Partially offsetting this decrease were increases of 377 thousand in company owned life insurance income, due to the higher crediting rate and associated impact to cash surrender value related to the surrender and redeploy strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2023, and 253 thousand in investment advisory income largely due to market-driven increases in assets under management. 
 50 

Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Noninterest expense totaled 32.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 34.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense of 2.3 million as a result of the sale of the assets of our insurance subsidiary, and the previously disclosed fourth quarter 2023 leadership and organizational changes, which reduced salaries and wages expense, 421 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense due in part to the timing of equipment purchases, and 414 thousand in other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an 889 thousand increase in professional services expense, due primarily to legal expenses related to the previously disclosed deposit fraud-related event. 
 The regulatory Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio were 10.62 , and 12.95 , respectively, at September 30, 2024. See the Liquidity and Capital Management section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion regarding regulatory capital and the Basel III capital rules. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest income is our primary source of revenue, comprising approximately 81 and 73 of revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities and repricing frequencies. 
 
 We use interest rate spread and net interest margin to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds net free funds ), principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders equity, also support earning assets. To compare tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, the yield on tax-exempt investment securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis.

Analysis of Net Interest Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 40.7 million, a decrease of 1.0 million versus the comparable quarter last year of 41.8 million. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher funding costs amid the current high interest rate environment. 
 Our net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.89 , 2-basis points lower than 2.91 for the same period in 2023 due to higher funding costs as a result of the continued high interest rate environment, offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the average yield on average interest earning assets of 5.53 was 32-basis points higher than the third quarter of 2023 of 5.21 primarily due to an increase in market interest rates. Average loan yields increased 27-basis points during the third quarter of 2024 to 6.42 from 6.15 for the third quarter of 2023, and the average yield on investment securities increased 26-basis points during the third quarter of 2024 to 2.14 from 1.88 for the third quarter of 2023. Overall, the average interest rate changes increased interest income by 3.8 million and volume variance decreased interest income by 578 thousand during the third quarter of 2024, which collectively drove a favorable variance of 3.2 million. 
 51 

Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Average interest-earning assets were 5.61 billion for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.70 billion for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 92.4 million, or 2 , from the comparable quarter last year, with a decrease in average securities of 83.5 million from 1.23 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to 1.15 billion for the third quarter of 2024, and a 13.2 million decrease in average Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially offset by an increase in average loans of 4.3 million from 4.41 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to 4.42 billion for the third quarter of 2024. Average loans comprised 79 of average interest-earning assets during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 77 during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average loans was primarily due to organic growth in commercial mortgages and stability in residential loans. Loans generally have significantly higher yields compared to other interest-earning assets and, as such, have a more positive effect on the net interest margin. The average yield on average loans was 6.42 for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 27-basis points compared to 6.15 for the comparable quarter in 2023 due to the impact of the higher market interest rates. Interest rate changes on average loans increased interest income by 2.9 million. Average investment securities represented 20 of average interest-earning assets during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 22 during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in average investment securities was primarily due to maturities of investment securities, and the use of cash to fund loan originations and reduce short-term borrowings. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the average cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 3.37 was 41-basis points higher than the third quarter of 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 3.34 was 50-basis points higher than the third quarter of 2023 due to the continued repricing of deposits at higher interest rates. The average cost of total borrowings decreased 55-basis points to 3.80 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.35 in the third quarter of 2023. The reduction in the cost of total borrowings was driven by a wholesale mix shift, with a lower level of outstanding balances, and the benefit of the Bank s cash flow hedging program. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were 4.40 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.43 billion for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 27.2 million, or 1 , driven by the 93.7 million decrease in the average balance of short-term borrowings, partially offset by a 66.2 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits. On average, interest-bearing deposits grew from 4.08 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to 4.15 billion for the current quarter while noninterest-bearing demand deposits (a principal component of net free funds) decreased 69.5 million to 953.0 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was due to growth in average non-public and public deposits, partially offset by decreases in average brokered and reciprocal deposits. For further discussion of our reciprocal and brokered deposits, refer to the Funding Activities Deposits section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis. The decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was due to the interest rate environment driving customers to higher interest bearing accounts. Overall, interest-bearing deposit rate changes resulted in a 5.0 million increase in interest expense, and volume changes resulted in a 593 thousand increase in interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year quarter. A decrease in average short-term borrowings decreased interest expense by 760 thousand, and a decrease in interest rates on short-term borrowings decreased interest expense by 619 thousand during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Analysis of Net Interest Income for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 122.2 million, a decrease of 4.0 million versus the comparable period in 2023 of 126.2 million. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher funding costs amid the current high interest rate environment. 
 Our net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.85 , 14-basis points lower than 2.99 for the same period in 2023 due to higher funding costs as a result of the continued high interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average yield on average interest earning assets of 5.49 was 51-basis points higher than the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 4.98 . The average yield on loans increased 49-basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 6.39 from 5.90 for the comparable period last year. The average yield on investment securities increased 25-basis points to 2.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Overall, the impact of the interest rate increases in 2023 and 2024 has a positive impact on yields, increasing interest income by 18.0 million, while volume variances in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities increased net interest income by 7.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Average interest-earning assets were 5.73 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.63 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 98.9 million, or 2 , with average loans up 150.2 million from 4.29 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.44 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a 40.7 million increase in average Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities of 92.0 million from 1.27 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.17 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Average investment securities represented 21 of average interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in average investment securities was primarily due to maturities of investment securities, and the use of cash to fund loan originations and reduce short-term borrowings. Loans comprised 78 of average interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 76 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average loans was primarily due to organic growth in commercial mortgages and residential real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in consumer indirect loans. Loans generally have significantly higher yields compared to other interest-earning assets and, as such, have a more positive effect on the net interest margin. Higher interest rates on loans increased interest income by 15.4 million, and an increase in the volume of average loans resulted in a 7.4 million increase in interest income.

Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 3.34 was 77-basis points higher than the average cost of 2.57 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the average cost of average interest-bearing deposits of 3.31 increasing 89-basis points from 2.42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the higher interest rate environment that began in 2023 and continued into 2024. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities of 4.52 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 170.1 million, or 3.9 , higher than the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in total average borrowings. On average, interest-bearing deposits increased 238.3 million from 4.01 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.25 billion for the current period, while noninterest-bearing demand deposits (a principal component of net free funds) decreased 83.4 million to 955.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. Total average borrowings decreased to 274.2 million for the current period, down 68.2 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as deposit growth enabled us to pay down short-term borrowings. The increase in average deposits was primarily due to growth in non-public, reciprocal, and public deposits, partially offset by a decrease in brokered deposits. For further discussion of the reciprocal deposit programs, refer to the Funding Activities Deposits section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis. Overall, interest-bearing deposit rate changes resulted in a 27.1 million increase in interest expense and volume changes contributed 5.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment.

The provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by a combination of factors, including a slight increase in the national unemployment forecast and higher qualitative factors overall, partially offset by lower loan balances. The benefit for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was reflective of the 4.9 million benefit for credit losses loans for the first quarter of 2024, which was driven by improvement in forecasted losses, positive trends in qualitative factors, including a reduction in consumer indirect loan delinquencies during the period, and a reduction in total period-end loan balances.

The April 1, 2024 sale of the assets of our insurance subsidiary generated a pre-tax gain of 13.7 million, after selling costs, which was included in net gain (loss) on other assets for the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in insurance income for the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 was reflective of the sale. 
 Investment advisory income increased 253 thousand, or 10 , to 2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a market-driven increase in assets under management in addition to business development. For the first nine months of 2024, investment advisory income decreased 128 thousand, or 2 , to 8.2 million compared to 8.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Income from company owned life insurance increased 377 thousand, or 37 , to 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, income from company owned life insurance increased 1.1 million, or 37 , to 4.1 million compared to 3.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily due to the higher crediting rate and associated impact to cash surrender value recorded in the linked quarter related to the previously disclosed surrender and redeploy strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Income from investments in limited partnerships of 400 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 was relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, income from investments in limited partnerships increased 434 thousand, or 39 , to 1.5 million compared to 1.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. We previously made several investments accounted for under the equity method. Income from these investments fluctuates based on the maturity and performance of the underlying investments. 
 Income from derivative instruments, net of 212 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 was relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, income from derivative income from derivative instruments, net decreased 655 thousand, or 46 , to 763 thousand compared to 1.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. Income from derivative instruments, net, is based on the number and value or interest rate swap transactions executed during the quarter combined with the impact of changes in the fair value of borrower-facing trades.

Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 2.3 million, or 13 , to 15.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 18.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 5.1 million, or 9 , to 49.0 million compared to 54.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in both periods was driven in part by lower salaries and wages in the 2024 periods, as a result of the sale of the assets of SDN, as well as our previously disclosed leadership and organizational changes completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Professional services expense increased 889 thousand, or 83 , to 2.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, professional services expense increased 2.3 million, or 59 , to 6.1 million compared to 3.8 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increases in both periods were primarily due to higher legal expenses in 2024 attributed to the deposit-related fraud event, including 384 thousand and 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and first nine months of 2024, respectively. 
 Computer and data processing expense increased 246 thousand, or 5 , to 5.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, computer and data processing expense increased 1.5 million, or 11 , to 16.1 million compared to 14.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase during the 2024 periods was due in part to an increase in digital banking expense attributable to increased usage along with our strategic investments in data efficiency and marketing technology. 
 Advertising and promotions expense decreased 373 thousand, or 50 , to 371 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 744 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, advertising and promotions expense decreased 448 thousand, or 29 , to 1.1 million, compared to 1.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in both periods reflected higher advertising and promotions expense in the prior year periods related to the money market campaign. 
 Deposit-related charged-off items expense for the first nine months of 2024 included an 18.2 million loss associated with charge-offs associated with the deposit-related fraudulent activity we experienced in early March 2024, including the 18.4 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by 143 thousand of recoveries recorded in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Other expense decreased 414 thousand, or 11 , to 3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, other expense increased 524 thousand, or 5 , to 11.1 million compared to 10.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in New York State capital base franchise tax accrual. 
 Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 was 64.70 and 71.75 , respectively, compared with 66.47 and 64.25 for the third quarter of 2023 and the first nine months of 2023, respectively. The higher efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2024 was reflective of the 18.2 million pre-tax loss in deposit-related charged-off items and approximately 1.4 million of legal and consulting expenses, recorded in professional services expense, attributed to the deposit-related fraud event, partially offset by the 13.7 million gain on the sale of the assets of our insurance subsidiary. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by net revenue, defined as the sum of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income before net gains on investment securities. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease indicates a more efficient allocation of resources. The efficiency ratio, a banking industry financial measure, is not required by GAAP. However, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to noninterest expense control. Management also believes such information is useful to investors in evaluating Company performance.

 Income Taxes 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 1.1 million and 6.0 million, versus 2.4 million and 7.6 million for the same periods in the prior year. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized federal and state tax benefits related to tax credit investments placed in service and/or amortized during the period resulting in a reduction in income tax expense of 1.3 million, versus 731 thousand for the same period in the prior year. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also included related tax credit investment benefits of 3.4 million and 2.1 million, respectively. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.4 and 12.6 , versus 14.8 and 15.9 , respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. Effective tax rates are typically impacted by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal or state taxation. Our effective tax rates reflect the impact of these items, which include, but are not limited to, interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance and the impact of tax credit investments. In addition, our effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 reflect the New York State tax benefit generated by our real estate investment trust.

Our available for sale AFS investment securities portfolio decreased 26.1 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The AFS portfolio had a net unrealized loss of 125.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 150.3 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the AFS portfolio balance was primarily due to maturities of investment securities, and the use of cash to fund loan originations and reduce short-term borrowings in the first nine months of 2024.

Impairment Assessment 
 For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether (i) we intend to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either case is affirmative, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security s amortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If neither case is affirmative, the security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of credit loss expense. AFS securities are charged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no allowance for credit losses was recognized on AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality.

Total commercial loans of 2.76 billion represented 63 of total loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.74 billion, or 61 of total loans as of December 31, 2023. Commercial business loans of 654.5 million, or 15 of total loans, were down 81.2 million, or 11 , from December 31, 2023, and total commercial mortgage loans of 2.11 billion, or 48 of total loans, were up 100.3 million, or 5 from December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial mortgage loans was attributable to increases in construction, multifamily, owner and non-owner occupied loans. As of September 30, 2024, commercial real estate CRE loans made up approximately 66 of total commercial loans, and 41 of total loans, commercial and industrial loans approximated 30 of total commercial loans, and 19 of total loans, and business banking unit loans were approximately 4 of total commercial loans and 3 of total loans. Our CRE committed credit exposure at September 30, 2024 related to approximately 42 multi-family, 18 office, 8 industrial property, 7 retail, 7 hospitality, and 6 home builder. Approximately 70 of our office exposure at September 30, 2024, or 12 of our total CRE exposure, related to Class B or medical office space. More than 70 of our office and 90 of our multifamily CRE loans have full or limited personal or corporate recourse. 
 Total consumer loans of 1.64 billion, or 37 of total loans at September 30, 2024, decreased 78.3 million from December 31, 2023. Consumer loans at September 30, 2024 were comprised of residential real estate loans and lines of credit of 724.4 million, or 16 of total loans, consumer indirect loans of 874.7 million, or 20 of total loans, and other consumer loans of 43.7 million, or 1 of total loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 170.5 million in indirect automobile loans with a mix of approximately 25 new automobile and 75 used automobile loans. This compares with the 238.2 million originated of indirect automobile loans with a mix of approximately 27 new automobile and 73 used automobile loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Origination volumes and the mix of new and used vehicles financed fluctuate depending on general market conditions. Effective January 1, 2024, we exited the Pennsylvania automobile market to align our focus more fully around our core Upstate New York market, which includes a strong network of approximately 375 new automobile dealers. 
 Loans Held for Sale and Loans Serviced for Others 
 Loans held for sale (not included in the loan portfolio composition table) were entirely comprised of residential real estate loans and totaled 2.5 million and 1.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We sell certain qualifying newly originated or refinanced residential real estate loans on the secondary market. Residential real estate loans serviced for others, which are not included in the consolidated statements of financial condition, amounted to 276.8 million and 269.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Loans not analyzed for a specific reserve are segmented into pools of loans based on their homogeneous risk characteristics, including purpose, tenor, amortization, repayment source, payment frequency, collateral and recourse. Once loans have been segmented into pools, a loss rate is applied to the amortized cost basis. This is referred to as the pooled loan component of the allowance for credit losses estimate. Loans have historically been divided into six portfolio segments of loans including Commercial Loans/Lines, Commercial Mortgage, Indirect Loans, Direct Loans, Residential Lines of Credit, and Residential Loans. Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, we further disaggregated the Commercial Mortgage loans into the following categories: Construction, Multifamily, Non-Owner Occupied, and Owner Occupied based on the risk characteristics of the loans and our methodology for monitoring and assessing credit risk. The allowance for credit losses for pooled loans estimate is based upon periodic review of the collectability of the loans quantitatively correlating historical loan experience with reasonable and supportable forecasts using forward looking information. Adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be made for differences in current or expected qualitative risk characteristics such as changes in underwriting standards, delinquency level, regulatory environment, economic condition, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including our Loan Review function. We establish a specific reserve for individually evaluated loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in the forecasted allowance for credit losses. These individually evaluated loans are removed from the pooling approach discussed above for the forecasted allowance for credit losses, and include nonaccrual loans, and other loans deemed appropriate by management, collectively referred to as collateral dependent loans. See Note 4., Loans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details on collateral dependent loans.

Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses loans involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge-offs in the loan portfolio after weighing a variety of factors, including the risk profile of our loan products and customers. 
 The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses loans is subject to ongoing management review. While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for credit losses loans, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review a financial institution s allowance for credit losses loans. Such agencies may require the financial institution to increase the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 Net charge-offs of 1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 represented 0.15 of average loans on an annualized basis compared to net charge-offs of 1.6 million, or 0.14 of average loans for the third quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses loans was 44.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 49.6 million at September 30, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses loans to total loans was 1.01 at September 30, 2024 and 1.12 at September 30, 2023. The ratio of allowance for credit losses loans to non-performing loans was 110 at September 30, 2024, compared with 521 at September 30, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans at September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023 was largely related to two separate and distinct commercial real estate loan relationships in our Upstate New York market, one of which was placed on nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024, and the other in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses loans by loan category as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which actual losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.

Non-performing assets include non-performing loans and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 were 40.9 million, an increase of 14.0 million from the 26.8 million balance at December 31, 2023. The primary component of non-performing assets is non-performing loans, which were 40.7 million or 0.93 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 26.7 million or 0.60 of total loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was largely related to a commercial mortgage - construction relationship that was placed on nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Approximately 1.2 million, or 3 , of the 40.7 million in non-performing loans as of September 30, 2024 were current with respect to payment of principal and interest but were classified as non-accruing because repayment in full of principal and/or interest was uncertain. 
 Foreclosed assets consist of real property formerly pledged as collateral for loans, which we have acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. We had 109 thousand and 142 thousand of properties representing foreclosed asset holdings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing, but information known about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes us to have concern as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as non-performing at some time in the future. These loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors, including payment history, the value of collateral supporting the credits, and/or personal or government guarantees. We consider loans classified as substandard, which continue to accrue interest, to be potential problem loans. We identified 34.7 million and 29.9 million in loans that continued to accrue interest which were classified as substandard as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of estimated uninsured deposits (deposits in amounts greater than 250 thousand, which is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance) was 2.09 billion, or 39 of total deposits, and 1.82 billion, or 35 of total deposits, respectively. The portion of our time deposits by account that were in excess of the FDIC insurance limit was 348.6 million and 302.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The maturities of our uninsured time deposits at September 30, 2024 were as follows: 162.7 million in three months or less; 32.5 million between three months and six months; 93.6 million between six months and one year; and 59.7 million over one year. Approximately 1.12 billion and 956.3 million of reciprocal and public deposits, characterized as preferred deposits for FDIC call report purposes, were collateralized by government-backed securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, estimated uninsured nonpublic deposits were approximately 18 of total deposits. 
 We offer a variety of deposit products designed to attract and retain customers, with the primary focus on building and expanding long-term relationships. At September 30, 2024, total deposits were 5.31 billion, representing an increase of 93.7 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in public, and non-public deposits, partially offset by decreases in brokered and reciprocal deposits. While seasonality in our public deposit portfolio was a contributor, public deposits accounts maintained higher balances during typical outflow cycles while growing deposits with new and existing municipalities. This was complemented by solid growth of non-public deposits during the nine month period. Time deposits were approximately 28 and 27 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Non-public deposits, the largest component of our funding sources, totaled 3.23 billion and 3.12 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represented 61 and 60 of total deposits as of each date, respectively. We have managed this segment of funding through a strategy of competitive pricing that minimizes the number of customer relationships that have only a single service high-cost deposit account. 
 As an additional source of funding, we offer a variety of public (municipal) deposit products to the towns, villages, counties and school districts within our market area. Public deposits generally range from 20 to 30 of our total deposits. There is a high degree of seasonality in this component of funding because the level of deposits varies with the seasonal cash flows for these public customers. We maintain the necessary levels of short-term liquidity to accommodate the seasonality associated with public deposits. Total public deposits were 1.18 billion and 1.02 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represented 22 of total deposits as of each date. 
 We also participate in reciprocal deposit programs, which enable depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage for deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum insurable amount. Through these programs, deposits in excess of the maximum insurable amount are placed with multiple participating financial institutions. Reciprocal deposits totaled 816.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 817.6 million at December 31, 2023, as this product has been an attractive option for customers with more than 250 thousand on deposit desiring FDIC insurance. Reciprocal deposits represented 15 and 16 of total deposits as of each date, respectively. 
 Brokered deposits totaled 79.4 million and 256.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represented 2 and 5 of total deposits as of each date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 29.4 million and 206.8 million of interest-bearing demand deposits and 50.0 million of time deposits were brokered deposit accounts. The Bank reduced the outstanding balance of the brokered sweep deposit portfolio by 180.0 million in April 2024 through the utilization of more cost effective funding sources.

Short-term Borrowings 
 Short-term Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB borrowings have original maturities of less than one year and include overnight borrowings which we typically utilize to address short term funding needs as they arise. Short-term FHLB borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 55.0 million and 107.0 million, respectively. The FHLB borrowings are collateralized by securities from the Company s investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. In May 2023, we borrowed 15.0 million under the Federal Reserve Bank FRB Bank Term funding program at a rate of 4.80 , which matured on May 8, 2024. In December 2023, we borrowed an additional 50 million under the program at an interest rate of 4.89 , which matures on December 13, 2024, and 13.0 million at an interest rate of 4.88 , which matures on December 20, 2024. Short-term borrowings and brokered deposits have historically been utilized to manage the seasonality of public deposits. We continue to be proactive in managing funding costs and reduced short-term borrowings in the third quarter. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 50.0 million of the short-term borrowings balance was designated as a cash-flow hedge, which became effective in April 2022, at a fixed rate of 0.787 , 30.0 million was designated as a cash-flow hedge, which became effective in January 2023, at a fixed rate of 3.669 , and 25.0 million was designated as a cash-flow hedge, which became effective in May 2023, at a fixed rate of 3.4615 . 
 We have credit capacity with the FHLB and can borrow through facilities that include amortizing and term advances or repurchase agreements. We had approximately 284.7 million of immediate credit capacity with the FHLB, and approximately 878.6 million in secured borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window as of September 30, 2024. The FHLB and FRB credit capacity are collateralized by securities from our investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. We had 155.0 million of credit available under unsecured federal funds purchased lines with various banks as of September 30, 2024, with no amounts outstanding. Additionally, we had approximately 133.7 million of unencumbered liquid securities available for pledging at September 30, 2024. 
 The Parent has a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank allowing borrowings up to 20.0 million in total as an additional source of working capital. At September 30, 2024, no amounts have been drawn on the line of credit. 
 Long-term Borrowings 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had a long-term advance payable to FHLB of 50.0 million. The advance matures on January 20, 2026 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.05 . FHLB advances are collateralized by securities from our investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. 
 On October 7, 2020, we completed a private placement of 35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes to qualified institutional buyers and accredited institutional investors that were subsequently exchanged for subordinated notes with substantially the same terms (the 2020 Notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2020 Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and bear interest, payable semi-annually, at the rate of 4.375 per annum, until October 15, 2025. Commencing on that date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 4.265 , payable quarterly until maturity. The 2020 Notes are redeemable by us, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after October 15, 2025, and we may redeem the Notes in whole at any time upon certain other specified events. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, organic growth and to support regulatory capital ratios at Five Star Bank. Proceeds, net of debt issuance costs of 740 thousand, were 34.3 million. The 2020 Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. 
 On April 15, 2015, we issued 40.0 million of subordinated notes (the 2015 Notes in a registered public offering. The 2015 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0 per year, payable semi-annually, for the first 10 years. From April 15, 2025 to the April 15, 2030 maturity date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then current three-month CME Term SOFR plus 4.20561 . The 2015 Notes are redeemable by us at any quarterly interest payment date beginning on April 15, 2025 to maturity at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Proceeds, net of debt issuance costs of 1.1 million, were 38.9 million. The 2015 Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.

Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 Liquidity 
 We continue to actively monitor our liquidity profile and funding concentrations in accordance with our Board approved Liquidity Policy. Management is actively monitoring customer activity by way of commercial and consumer line of credit utilization, as well as deposit flows. As of September 30, 2024, all structural liquidity ratios and early warning indicators remain in compliance, with what we believe are ample funding sources available in the event of a stress scenario. 
 The objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure that we meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity, the repayment of matured borrowings, the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. We achieve liquidity by maintaining a strong base of both core customer funds and maturing short-term assets; we also rely on our ability to sell or pledge securities and lines-of-credit and our overall ability to access to the financial and capital markets. 
 Liquidity for the Bank is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans, the investment portfolio, deposits and wholesale funds. The strength of the Bank s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits. These core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include credit lines with other banking institutions, the FHLB, the FRB Discount Window, and brokered deposit relationships. 
 The primary source of our non-deposit short-term borrowings is FHLB advances, of which 55.0 million were outstanding at September 30, 2024. In addition to this amount, we have additional collateralized wholesale borrowing capacity of approximately 1.32 billion as of September 30, 2024 from various funding sources which include the FHLB, the FRB and commercial banks that we can use to fund lending activities, liquidity needs, and/or to adjust and manage our asset and liability position. 
 The Parent s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of non-bank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The Parent obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends received from the Bank, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, and the issuance of debt and equity securities. In addition, the Parent maintains a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank for an aggregate amount of up to 20.0 million, all of which was available at September 30, 2024. The line of credit has a one-year term and matures in May 2025. Funds drawn would be used for general corporate purposes and backup liquidity. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 249.6 million as of September 30, 2024, up 125.1 million from 124.4 million as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled 50.1 million and the principal source of operating activity cash flow was net income adjusted for noncash income and expense items. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled 126.7 million, which primarily included inflows from a decrease in net loans of 53.2 million, 51.0 million for net proceeds from investment securities, and 27.0 million for the proceeds from the sale of the assets of SDN, partially offset by outflows of 4.6 million for purchases of premises and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities of 51.7 million was primarily attributed to a 130.0 million net decrease in short-term borrowings, and 15.0 million in dividend payments, partially offset by a 93.7 million net increase in deposits. 
 Capital Management 
 We actively manage capital, commensurate with our risk profile, to enhance shareholder value. We also seek to maintain capital levels for the Company and the Bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory well-capitalized thresholds. Periodically, we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position. 
 Banks and financial holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. 
 Shareholders equity was 500.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 45.5 million from 454.8 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to net income in the first nine months of 2024, and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 17.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to a decrease in net unrealized losses on securities available for sale. 
 The FRB and FDIC have adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s BCBS capital guidelines for U.S. banks. See the Basel III Capital Rules section below for further discussion.

 We have elected to apply the 2020 Current Expected Credit Losses CECL transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the US banking agencies March 2020 interim final rule. Under the 2020 CECL transition provision, the regulatory capital impact of the Day 1 adjustment to the allowance for credit losses (after-tax) upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date has been deferred and has begun to phase into regulatory capital at 25 per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, we were allowed to defer the regulatory capital impact of the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25 of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pre-tax) recognized through earnings for each period between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, also began to phase into regulatory capital at 25 per year commencing January 1, 2022. 
 Basel III Capital Rules 
 Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the current minimum capital ratios, including an additional capital conservation buffer applicable to the Company and the Bank, are: 
 7.0 CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

8.5 Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

10.5 Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. 

Banking institutions with a capital conservation buffer below the minimum level will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the Basel III Capital Rules. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and Bank s capital levels remained characterized as well capitalized under the Basel III rules, including the additional capital conversion buffer.

Dividend Restrictions 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is dependent upon dividends from the Bank to provide funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders and to provide for other cash requirements. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid. Approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank to fall below specified minimum levels. Approval is also required if dividends declared exceed the net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualit ative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the potential impact on earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. The Bank s market risk management framework has been developed to control both short-term and long-term exposure within Board approved policy limits and is monitored by the Asset-Liability Management Committee and Board of Directors. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk were presented at December 31, 2023 in Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2024. The following is an update of the discussion provided therein. 
 Portfolio Composition 
 There was no material change in the composition of assets, deposit liabilities or borrowings from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. See the section titled Analysis of Financial Condition in Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of asset, deposit and borrowing activity during the period. 
 Net Interest Income at Risk 
 A primary tool used to manage interest rate risk is rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity. Rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income as well as economic value of equity. 
 Net interest income at risk is measured by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of different magnitudes over a period of 12 months. The following table sets forth the estimated changes to net interest income over the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025, assuming instantaneous changes in interest rates for the given rate shock scenarios (dollars in thousands):

In the rising rate scenarios, the static model results indicate that net interest income is modeled to increase compared to the flat rate scenario over a one-year time frame. This is a combination of an increase across the entire deposit portfolio, which has decreased wholesale borrowings and the higher cost associated with the borrowings. This simulation does not consider balance sheet growth or a change in the balance sheet mix. As intermediate and longer-term assets continue to mature and are replaced at higher yields, net interest income should improve over the longer-term time frame. Model results in the declining rate scenario show a decrease in net interest income due to a combination of increases in the yield curve, as well as increases in higher paying public and nonpublic deposits, which will reprice downward slower due to market deposit competition. 
 In addition to the changes in interest rate scenarios listed above, other scenarios are typically modeled to measure interest rate risk. These scenarios vary depending on the economic and interest rate environment. Furthermore, given the static balance sheet approach, retained earnings are considered to be reinvested in a noninterest earning asset. 
 The simulation referenced above is based on our assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve. It also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates. Further, it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. While this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates, it is not a forecast of future results, does not measure the effect of changing interest rates on noninterest income and is based on many assumptions that, if changed, could cause a different outcome. 
 Economic Value of Equity at Risk 
 The economic (or fair value of financial instruments on our balance sheet will also vary under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed. This variance is measured by simulating changes in our economic value of equity EVE ), which is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair value of liabilities from the estimated fair value of assets. Fair values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows (principal and interest) at current replacement rates for each account type, while fair values of non-financial assets and liabilities are assumed to equal book value and do not vary with interest rate fluctuations. An economic value simulation is a static measure for balance sheet accounts at a given point in time, but this measurement can change substantially over time as the characteristics of our balance sheet evolve and as interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated. 
 The amount of change in economic value under different interest rate scenarios depends on the characteristics of each class of financial instrument, including the stated interest rate or spread relative to current market rates or spreads, the likelihood of prepayment, whether the rate is fixed or floating, and the maturity date of the instrument. As a rule, fixed-rate financial assets become more valuable in declining rate scenarios and less valuable in rising rate scenarios, while fixed-rate financial liabilities gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value as interest rates decline. The longer the duration of the financial instrument, the greater the impact a rate change will have on its value. In our economic value simulations, estimated prepayments are factored in for financial instruments with stated maturity dates, and decay rates for non-maturity deposits are projected based on historical data (back-testing).

 The analysis that follows presents the estimated EVE resulting from market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter-end Pre-Shock Scenario ), and under other interest rate scenarios (each a Rate Shock Scenario represented by immediate, permanent, parallel shifts in interest rates from those observed at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands). The analysis additionally presents a measurement of the interest rate sensitivity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. EVE amounts are computed under each respective Pre-Shock Scenario and Rate Shock Scenario. An increase in the EVE amount is considered favorable, while a decline is considered unfavorable. The following table sets forth the estimated changes to EVE assuming instantaneous changes in interest rates for the given rate shock scenarios (dollars in thousands):

The increase in the Pre-Shock Scenario EVE at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is the result of the overall value increase of the loan portfolio, slightly offset by deposits. The sensitivity in the down Rate Shock Scenarios to EVE grow more negative at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. This is a result from concentrated efforts to grow the deposit portfolio to decrease wholesale borrowings, and a subsequent mix shift from non-maturity deposits to time deposits. As a result, the shift from non-maturity to time deposits has made the deposit portfolio slightly less valuable in non-public deposits which was slightly offset by the seasonal inflow of non-maturity public deposits. 
 ITEM 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b), as adopted by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. L egal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of prosecution, defense and settlement costs, unfavorable awards, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 We are party to an action filed against us on May 16, 2017 by Matthew L. Chipego, Charlene Mowry, Constance C. Churchill and Joseph W. Ewing in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs sought class certification to represent classes of consumers in New York and Pennsylvania along with statutory damages, interest and declaratory relief. The plaintiffs sought to represent a putative class of consumers who are alleged to have obtained direct or indirect financing from us for the purchase of vehicles that we later repossessed. The plaintiffs specifically claim that the notices the Bank sent to defaulting consumers after their vehicles were repossessed did not comply with the relevant portions of the Uniform Commercial Code in New York and Pennsylvania. We dispute and believe we have meritorious defenses against these claims and plan to vigorously defend ourselves. 
 On September 30, 2021, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification and certified four different classes (two classes of New York consumers and two classes of Pennsylvania consumers). There are approximately 5,200 members in the New York classes and 300 members in the Pennsylvania classes. 
 On September 26, 2022, the lower Court denied the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment for most of the relief they seek and found that there were questions of fact as to whether the members of the class had purchased the subject vehicles for consumer use within the meaning of the relevant statutes. The Court also denied our motion for partial summary judgment seeking an offset in the form of recoupment reducing any liability that may be imposed against us by the amounts that the borrowers owe for failing to repay their motor vehicle loans, determining that the Court could not enter a judgment on recoupment which is a set off from liability without first determining whether there was liability. 
 During the July 11, 2024 pretrial conference, the Court instructed the parties to engage in further settlement of non-binding mediation discussions and set a September 11, 2024 deadline to file motions in limine and a bench trial to commence on May 5, 2025. 
 All depositions and document productions have been completed. Plaintiff did not file a Motion in Limine by September 11, 2024. Plaintiffs however filed a motion for partial judgment on October 8, 2024 asserting that the recoupment claims were barred because they were too distinct from the underlying claims. We intend to file an opposition against the motion for partial summary judgment with the Court by the November 7, 2024 deadline. The parties continue to discuss potential candidates to serve as a mediator in response to the Court s instruction that they explore further settlement or mediation discussions. 
 We have not accrued a contingent liability for this matter at this time because, given our defenses, we are unable to conclude whether a liability is probable to occur nor are we able to currently reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss. 
 If we settle these claims or the action is not resolved in our favor, we may suffer reputational damage and incur legal costs, settlements or judgments that exceed the amounts covered by our insurer. We can provide no assurances that our insurer will cover the full legal costs, settlements or judgments we incur. If we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves from these claims or if our insurer does not cover the full amount of legal costs we incur, the result may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
