Minerva Gold Inc. is a junior mineral exploration company engaged in the identification, acquisition and exploration of precious metals in Kazakhstan. . These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. Management has assessed the Company s current financial condition and plans to continue as a going concern. In its assessment, management acknowledges that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management s plan is to address this uncertainty by securing additional capital resources through funding from management and significant shareholders, as well as pursuing third-party equity and/or debt financing to meet the Company's minimal operating expenses. While management is actively seeking these additional sources of capital, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient capital, it may be unable to continue as a going concern, and adjustments to the financial statements may be required, including potential impairment of assets and the reclassification of liabilities. These financial statements do not include any such adjustments, as management s plans have not yet been realized. Cash and Cash Equivalents .

As of the date the financial statements were issued, the Company has not executed the SPA, made the required cash payments, or funded any exploration or development work on the property. Consequently, since the period for meeting the initial obligations has passed, the Option Agreement is considered terminated, and the Company no longer holds any rights to the Arsy deposit. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company does not have any material commitments other than those previously discussed in this Note. As of August 31, 2024, the Company is not aware of any contingent liabilities, legal disputes, or other obligations that could impact its financial position and that should be reflected in the financial statements. 9 | page Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS We were incorporated on February 24, 2021 in the State of Nevada. We are a start-up company which is in the mineral property exploration business. We started operating activities, which include the incorporation of our company, the initial equity funding by our sole officer and director, developing our business plan, engaging in market research and the execution of consulting contract with a geologist. In addition, on March 29, 2023, we signed a Mineral Property Option Agreement with Tuzashuu Ken Limited Liability Company for the exploration of the Arsy deposit. However, the agreement was terminated after the Company failed to meet the required obligations within the specified timeframe, and as of now, no rights to the property are held. Other than the activities mentioned, no additional operations have been conducted to date. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. As of August 31, 2024, our total assets were 0 compared to 58 in total assets at February 29, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, our total liabilities were 52,032 compared to 33,710 in total liabilities at February 29, 2024. Stockholders equity was negative 52,032 as of August 31, 2024 compared to negative 33,652 as of February 29, 2024. 10 | page Table of Contents Three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to three months ended August 31, 2023 During three months ended August 31, 2024, we incurred expenses of 4,982 compared to 3,555 during three months ended August 31, 2023. Our net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 4,982 compared to 3,555 during three months ended August 31, 2023. Six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to six months ended August 31, 2023 During six months ended August 31, 2024, we incurred expenses of 18,380 compared to 15,148 during six months ended August 31, 2023. Our net loss for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 18,380 compared to 15,148 during six months ended August 31, 2023. Cash Flows used by Operating Activities For the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities were 18,322 comprised of net loss of 18,380 and depreciation expense of 58. For the six-month period ended August 31, 2023 net cash net cash flows used in operating activities were 15,233 comprised of net loss of 15,148, decrease in accounts payable of 200 and depreciation expense of 115. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, net cash flows from financing activities were 18,322 received from loan the related party compared to 433 for the six-month period ended August 31, 2023. PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. While existing working capital is currently unavailable, further advances, debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 11 | page Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. GOING CONCERN The independent registered public accounting firm auditors' report accompanying our February 29, 2024 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management has a disclosure in the financial statements to this effect as well. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) within the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in a timely manner.
