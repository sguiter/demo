 and respectively, and the Company has an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. The Company anticipates that it will incur net losses for the foreseeable future and, even if it increases revenue, there is no guarantee that it will ever become profitable. All of the aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Until the Company can generate sufficient revenue to cover its operating expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures, it will rely on private and public capital raising efforts. The Company plans to finance its operations with proceeds from the issuance and sale of equity securities or debt; however, there is no assurance that management's plans to obtain additional debt or equity financing will be successfully implemented or implemented on terms favorable to the Company. Significant Risks and Uncertainties The Company s current business activities consist of business planning, research and development efforts to design and develop high-power, high-brightness blue laser technology, and capital raising to finance the Company through full commercialization; however, the Company s ability to operate has been significantly impacted by its inability to obtain sufficient financing. The Company is subject to the risks associated with such activities, including the need to further develop its technology and its marketing and distribution channels; further develop its supply chain and manufacturing; and hire additional management and other key personnel. Successful completion of the Company s development program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations, are dependent upon future events, including its ability to access potential markets and secure long-term financing. The Company s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company s future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, rapid technological change, competition from substitute products and larger companies, protection of proprietary technology, ability to maintain distributor relationships and dependence on key individuals.

(1) shares of Common Stock as of the Closing of the Business Combination to be reserved for potential future issuance upon the exercise of Nuburu options or settlement of Nuburu RSUs. (2) Public Warrants issued and outstanding as of the Closing of the Business Combination. 
 The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP because Legacy Nuburu has been determined to be the accounting acquirer. Under this method of accounting, Tailwind, which is the legal acquirer, is treated as the accounting acquiree for financial reporting purposes and Legacy Nuburu, which is the legal acquiree, is treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of Legacy Nuburu have become the historical financial statements of Nuburu, and Tailwind s assets, liabilities and results of operations have been consolidated with Legacy Nuburu s beginning on the acquisition date. For accounting purposes, the financial statements of Nuburu represent a continuation of the financial statements of Legacy Nuburu with the Business Combination being treated as the equivalent of Legacy Nuburu issuing stock for the net assets of Tailwind, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Tailwind are stated at historical costs and no goodwill or other intangible assets have been recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination will be presented as those of Legacy Nuburu in future reports of Nuburu. Legacy Nuburu was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation of the following facts and circumstances: Legacy Nuburu stockholders comprise a majority of the voting power of Nuburu; 

 The Nuburu board of directors consists only of members of the Legacy Nuburu board of directors or nominees selected by Legacy Nuburu; 

 Legacy Nuburu s operations prior to the acquisition comprise the only ongoing operations of Nuburu; 

 Legacy Nuburu s senior management comprises the senior management of Nuburu; 

 Nuburu has assumed the Legacy Nuburu name; and 

 Legacy Nuburu s headquarters have become Nuburu s headquarters. 

 All periods prior to the Business Combination have been retrospectively adjusted using the Exchange Ratios for the equivalent number of shares outstanding immediately after the Closing to effect the reverse recapitalization. In connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, the Company received net proceeds from the Business Combination totaling million, prior to deducting transaction and issuance costs. Legacy Nuburu s total transaction expenses were approximately million and Tailwind s total transaction expenses were approximately million after taking into account waivers of costs incurred by Legacy Nuburu and Tailwind.

If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.

 Junior Notes Issued August 2024 (the "August 2024 Convertible Notes") On August 6, 2024 and August 19, 2024, the Company entered into a subordinated convertible note agreement (the "August 2024 Convertible Note Agreement") with Esousa Group Holdings LLC ("Esousa") for the sale of convertible notes (the "August 2024 Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of , issued at a discount of . The August 2024 Convertible Notes bear interest at per annum, with principal and accrued interest due at maturity on , unless earlier paid or converted into common stock. The notes are prepayable at any time prior to the maturity date without penalty. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default or spin-off of a subsidiary, a default interest rate of an additional 5 per annum may be applied to any outstanding borrowings (in the case of an event of default only) and the investor may declare all outstanding principal plus accrued interest immediately due. Additionally, at any point after issuance, the investor has the option to convert the August 2024 Convertible Notes into common stock at the lower of (i) a fixed price of or (ii) of the lowest daily volume weighted-average price in the trading days prior to such conversion date, subject to certain adjustments. Issuances of common stock on conversion are (i) subject to approval by NYSE American of a supplemental listing application, (ii) limited to an amount equal to of the outstanding common stock as of the date of execution, until such time as the transaction is approved by stockholders and (iii) required to be registered with the SEC for resale. With certain exceptions, the Company is prohibited from issuing new securities until such stockholder approval is obtained and the registration statement registering the securities issuable under such notes has been effective for a period of at least 30 days (the Restricted Period ). As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate of the August 2024 Convertible Notes was , which reflects the impact of the August 2024 Convertible Note Derivative Liability, defined and described below. As required under the terms of the August 2024 Convertible Notes, the Company called a stockholder meeting to approve the securities issuable upon conversion of such notes. However, the Company was unable to achieve quorum and was forced to delay obtaining such approval. Further, while the Company timely filed a registration statement for the resale of shares issuable on conversion, it has not yet been declared effective by the SEC. As a result, the Company is currently in default under the terms of such notes. The Company determined that the conversion and share-settled redemption features, as well as the automatic increase in interest rate upon an event of default feature, of the August 2024 Convertible Notes were embedded derivatives that were required to be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as embedded derivative instruments, which the Company compounded (the "August 2024 Convertible Note Derivative Liability"). As the Company did not elect the fair value option for the August 2024 Convertible Notes, the proceeds from the August 2024 Convertible Notes were allocated to the initial fair value of the August 2024 Convertible Note Derivative Liability, which was determined to be , with the residual balance allocated to the initial carrying value of the August 2024 Convertible Notes host instrument. For additional information related to the fair value of the August 2024 Convertible Note Derivative Liability, see Note 5. The Company incurred in debt issuance costs for legal fees related to the issuance of the August 2024 Convertible Notes. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of the August 2024 Convertible Notes, the Company issued warrants to a financial services firm as compensation for their services performed, the fair value of which was determined to be and was recorded as a debt issuance cost. For additional information regarding these warrants, see Note 10.

This resulted in the issuance of shares of Nuburu Series A preferred stock to those non-redeeming stockholders. Tailwind and the Tailwind Sponsor entered into the Sponsor Support and Forfeiture Agreement. In connection with the Business Combination, the Founder Shares were forfeited other than shares of Common Stock (of which, shares were transferred to Nautilus Maser Fund, L.P. and shares were transferred to Cohen Company Capital Markets at Closing) and shares of Series A preferred stock.

The Junior Note Warrants currently outstanding have an exercise price equal to per share (subject to adjustment per the Junior Note Purchase Agreements) and expire on . The Junior Note Purchase Agreements also provide for additional warrants to be issued if the Junior Notes remain outstanding for certain periods of time: (i) if the Junior Notes have not been repaid six months after issuance, additional warrants will be issued to each Lender in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Note multiplied by , and such quotient divided by a per share cash exercise price equal to of the Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") of the Company's Common Stock during the trading days immediately prior to issuance and (ii) if the Junior Notes have not been repaid nine months after issuance, additional warrants will be issued to each Lender in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Note multiplied by , and such quotient divided by a per share cash exercise price equal to of the VWAP of the Company's Common Stock during the trading days immediately prior to issuance. As a portion of the Junior Notes were outstanding at each of May 13, 2024 and August 13, 2024, the Company was required to issue additional warrants pursuant to the Junior Note Purchase Agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on the terms of the Junior Note Purchase Agreements, the Junior Note Warrants were evaluated under FASB ASC 815-40 - Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity ("ASC 815-40") and the Company concluded they did not initially meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity (deficit). Specifically, there were contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions that existed, as described above, where the number of shares available under the Junior Note Warrants may be adjusted. Because the number of outstanding common shares was not a fair value input to a fixed-for-fixed model, the Junior Note Warrants are treated as liabilities and are remeasured at each reporting date. The proceeds of were allocated first to the Junior Note Warrant liability at fair value and then to the Junior Notes. The Company further determined that the Junior Warrant liability meets the criteria to be accounted for as a bifurcated derivative due to the significant discount it creates on the Junior Notes. Public Warrants In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, Nuburu assumed the Public Warrants outstanding on the date of Closing. As of September 30, 2024 , all Public Warrants remain outstanding. However, on December 12, 2023, the NYSE American notified the Company and publicly announced that the NYSE American had determined to (a) commence proceedings to delist the Company s Public Warrants, each whole Public Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of per share, and listed to trade on the NYSE American under the symbol BURU WS , and (b) immediately suspend trading in the Public Warrants due to abnormally low trading price levels. As such, the Public Warrants were determined to have no value in the financial statements as of September 30, 2024. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing days after the completion of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its Public Warrants only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. The Public Warrants will expire after the completion of the Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Redemptions of Public Warrants when the price of Common Stock equals or exceeds Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants: in whole and not in part;

 if the closing price of the Common Stock for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than per share, the Private Placement Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.

The exercise price for the pre-funded warrants is substantially paid by the purchaser at closing and, as a result, such warrants may be exercised in the future with a nominal exercise price payment. Investors will also receive a warrant to acquire the same number of shares covered by the pre-funded warrant for a purchase price equal to of the relevant pre-funded warrant purchase price exercisable for a period of years. Each specific transaction will be entered into on terms agreed by the parties; provided however, that in no case will the purchase price per share be less than of the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of purchase. Contemporaneously with the acquisition of pre-funded warrants, the investors may also voluntarily convert outstanding notes previously issued by the Company; provided that such transactions, as a whole, may not result in an effective direct or indirect discount to market price to the investors of greater than .

The Company has determined that a Section 382 change in ownership occurred during 2023. As a result of this change in ownership, we expect that certain of the Company's NOLs may not be utilized in the future to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. However, due to the full valuation allowance recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the limitation does not affect the Company's results of operations for the periods presented.

The Investor was also required to engage in good faith best efforts to prepay or otherwise acquire outstanding notes held by Esousa, given among other things the failure to achieve quorum at the special meeting called to approve the Esousa transaction and the restrictions on the issuance of additional shares until after such time as such stockholder approval is obtained.

The Company called a special stockholder meeting to approve the securities issuable upon conversion of the Esousa notes, which had been scheduled to take place on September 27, 2024. The proxy statement relating to such meeting requested approval of securities issuances in other capital raising transactions as well, which would have facilitated certain transactions under the Master Agreement. However, the Company was unable to achieve quorum and was forced to adjourn, and then ultimately cancel, the special meeting. The Company timely filed a registration statement, which it anticipates will be effective during the fourth quarter of 2024 and has filed a proxy statement for a second stockholder meeting to approve, among other things, the issuances of shares in connection with the Esousa and Liqueous transactions, which is scheduled to take place on December 27, 2024. The Company has negotiated financing transactions that would provide capital necessary to continue its path to commercialization; however, if the Company is unable to obtain the required stockholder approval to issue additional securities (and consent from certain investors with additional contractual rights to the extent required) or the counter parties do not perform under the terms of such financing agreements, the Company will not be able to sustain operations and will need to consider alternatives, which could include a sale, liquidation, or dissolution of the business or a foreclosure by its senior secured creditors.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and our Amended 10-K that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, references in this section to Nuburu, we, us, our and the Company refer to Nuburu, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary, Nuburu Subsidiary, Inc. 
 Company Overview 
 Nuburu, Inc. is a leading innovator in high-power, high-brightness blue laser technology that is focused on bringing breakthrough improvements to a broad range of high-value applications, including welding and 3D printing. By delivering increased speed and quality we hope to enhance productivity and cost efficiency for manufacturers in the e-mobility, consumer electronics, aerospace and defense, and 3D printing markets, as well as to find additional applications currently not yet serviced by existing laser technologies. 
 We have invented, patented, and developed what we believe to be the next pivotal point for manufacturing technology, with the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing industry by changing how products are made. Our technology is also aligned with the need to reduce carbon generation in manufacturing. The Nuburu laser system outperforms currently available alternatives by more efficiently coupling heat into the material being processed, thereby helping to promote a more sustainable future by using less energy and, in turn, generating less carbon in the manufacturing process. 
 A fundamental physical characteristic is that metals absorb blue laser light better than infrared laser light. In the case of materials such as gold, copper, silver and aluminum, the advantage of blue laser light is substantial. The better absorption results in substantial improvements in the quality of the part produced, the yield of parts during production and the speed at which the part can be produced. We believe that these advantages enable efficiencies in the overall productivity of the manufacturing line and can extend the life of the products produced. We also believe that these characteristics will be advantageous to our customers, whether in upgrading existing manufacturing processes or enabling entirely new approaches to manufacturing through the use of Nuburu s laser systems in either industrial welding or 3D printing technology applications. 
 Nuburu provides blue laser systems for welding applications such as batteries, large screen displays, and cell phone components. Nuburu has over 220 granted and pending patents and patent applications globally, which include: blue laser applications such as welding, blue laser technologies, single mode blue laser technology, blue Raman laser technologies, addressable array technologies, and 3D printing using blue lasers. Notably, Nuburu has been awarded patent protection for the use of high-power blue lasers. 
 Given the size, complexity and value of our blue laser technology, our sales to date have come from long-term discussions between our management team and our current customers. Based on our experiences so far, we expect the approximate adoption timelines of our customers from first contact to first purchase order to range up to 22-24 months. Going forward, we intend to expand our marketing efforts, as we pursue a more widespread adoption of our blue laser technology. 
 We have developed and trained and expect to continue to develop and train third-party distributors that provide sales and customer support functions in their specific territory, including business development and sales, application and service support and local marketing. Our distributors are, and are expected to be, an integral part of our sales and marketing strategy. The Americas region is managed from our headquarters, but we have distributor partners located in key countries worldwide to help target current and prospective customers in Asia (particularly in China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, India, and Taiwan) and in Europe. 
 As we have disclosed previously, we have not yet achieved commercialization and expect continued losses until we can do so. We must rely on capital from investors to support our operations. During 2024, management negotiated several funding agreements with multiple investors. Certain of these investors have not fully performed their obligations under such agreements and the Company has been unable to obtain stockholder approval necessary to consummate certain transactions because it was unable to achieve quorum for the special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose. As a result, the Company has not received the funding necessary to maintain operations, fill orders or implement its sales and marketing program. Given the lack of funding, management initiated measures designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees. This significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024. In response to the furloughs and financing challenges, several key employees have resigned entirely. The Company has negotiated financing transactions that would provide capital necessary to continue its path to commercialization and has now filed two proxy statements soliciting consent from stockholders for the issuances of shares pursuant to such transactions; however, if investors do not perform under the terms of such agreements, or the Company is unable to obtain the required stockholder approval to issue additional securities (or consent from certain investors with additional contractual rights to the extent required), the Company will not be able to sustain operations and will need to consider alternatives, which could include a sale, liquidation, or dissolution of the business. 
 We generated total revenue of nil and 186,743 and had net losses of 4,377,522 and 5,085,301 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated total revenue of 142,827 and 1,710,794 and had net losses 22,765,563 and 15,959,530, respectively.

Table of Contents 

We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we: 
 continue our research and development efforts; 

seek to commercialize our products; and 

operate as a public company. 

Accordingly, we will continue to seek to fund our operations through public or private equity financings, debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all, or counter parties to such agreements may not perform. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition. 
 The Business Combination 
 On January 31, 2023, we consummated the Business Combination. 
 Being an SEC-registered and publicly traded company has required us to hire additional personnel and to implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. Compared to the operations of Legacy Nuburu, we have incurred and expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees, and additional internal and external accounting, legal, and administrative resources, including increased personnel costs, audit and other professional service fees. 
 Recent Developments 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On February 22, 2024, we held a special meeting of stockholders where stockholders approved proposals to authorize the Company to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Stock within a range from 1-for 30 to 1-for-75, with the exact ratio of the reverse stock split to be determined by the Company's board of directors. On July 23, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-40 reverse stock split (the "Reverse Stock Split"). 
 April 2024 SPA Agreement 
 On April 3, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with certain accredited investors named therein pursuant to which the investors agreed to purchase from the Company 3,000,000 of newly issued shares (the Shares of the Company s Common Stock, at a per Share purchase price of 5.00 per Share. Only a portion of the purchase price 644,936) has been advanced. In October 2024, a notification of default was sent to the investors for failure to provide the remainder of the purchase price. 
 
 Warrant Issuances and Note Extinguishments 
 Pre-Funded Warrants 
 On May 1, 2024, we entered into a Pre-Funded Warrant Purchase Program (the Program with strategic investors, pursuant to which from time-to-time the Company may sell and the investors may acquire pre-funded warrants, up to a total purchase price to the Company equal to 15 million. The exercise price for the pre-funded warrants is substantially paid by the purchaser at closing and, as a result, such warrants may be exercised in the future with a nominal exercise price payment. Investors will also receive a warrant to acquire the same number of shares covered by the pre-funded warrant for a purchase price equal to 150 of the relevant pre-funded warrant purchase price exercisable for a period of 5 years. Each specific transaction will be entered into on terms agreed by the parties; provided however, that in no case will the purchase price per share be less than 110 of the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of purchase. Contemporaneously with the acquisition of pre-funded warrants, the investors may also voluntarily convert outstanding notes previously issued by the Company; provided that such transactions, as a whole, may not result in an effective direct or indirect discount to market price to the investors of greater than 30 . 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 665,410 and 837,116 pre-funded warrants, respectively, for total cash proceeds of 600,000 and 2,139,866, respectively, in pre-funded warrants pursuant to the Program. Each pre-funded warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price ranging f rom 125 to 140 of the relevant pre-funded warrant purchase price. The pre-funded warrant is exercisable any time after issuance through five years. No pre-funded warrants were exercised during the periods presented. The proceeds from the issuance of the pre-funded warrants were recorded to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Additional Warrant Issuances 
 Further, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued certain additional warrants. For additional information, see notes 8 and 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Note Extinguishments 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 2,399,850 and 4,648,162 shares, respectively, to noteholders to extinguish an aggregate 0.7 million and 4.8 million, respectively, of principal and accrued interest under the Senior Notes and Junior Notes. 
 August 2024 Convertible Notes 
 On August 6, 2024 and August 19, 2024, the Company entered into the August 2024 Convertible Note Agreement with Esousa for the sale of the August 2024 Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 673,000, issued at a discount of 25,000. The August 2024 Convertible Notes bear interest at 15 per annum, with principal and accrued interest due at maturity on February 6, 2025, unless earlier paid or converted into common stock. The notes are prepayable at any time prior to the maturity date without penalty. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default or spin-off of a subsidiary, a default interest rate 
 31 

Table of Contents 

of an additional 5 per annum may be applied to any outstanding borrowings and the investor may declare all outstanding principal plus accrued interest immediately due. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate of the August 2024 Convertible Notes was 180.2 . Additionally, at any point after issuance, the investor has the option to convert the August 2024 Convertible Notes into common stock at the lower of (i) a fixed price of 2.03 or (ii) 80 of the lowest daily volume weighted-average price in the 10 trading days prior to such conversion date, subject to certain adjustments. Issuances of common stock on conversion are (i) subject to approval by NYSE American of a supplemental listing application, (ii) limited to an amount equal to 19.9 of the outstanding common stock as of the date of execution, until such time as the transaction is approved by stockholders, and (iii) required to be registered with the SEC for resale. While the Company called a special meeting to obtain the required stockholder approval, it was unable to achieve quorum and was forced to adjourn, and then ultimately cancel, the special meeting, which results a default under the terms of the notes issued to Esousa. 
 Esousa also purchased 687,315 of outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Senior Convertible Notes from an existing investor and subsequently exchanged such notes for the Additional August 2024 Convertible Notes. The Additional August 2024 Convertible Notes may be prepaid at any time without penalty, do not accrue interest, mature on February 6, 2025 and may be converted at any time on or after the issuance date into common stock at a conversion price of 25 of the closing price of the common stock on the trading day prior to such conversion date, subject to certain adjustments. 
 The August 2024 Convertible Notes and Additional August 2024 Convertible Notes are unsecured and subordinated to the Company s outstanding senior convertible notes and junior bridge notes in right of payment, whether in respect to payment or redemptions, interest, damages, upon liquidation or dissolution or otherwise. 
 
 Long-Term Funding Program 
 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Master Agreement with Liqueous LP (the Investor pursuant to which, the Company and the Investor established a strategic financing framework for short-term and long-term financing for the Company. The Master Agreement provides for: (i) an immediate capital infusion from the Investor of 3.0 million at current market price, (ii) subsequent weekly capital infusions of 1,250,000 at market price until an additional 10 million has been invested; (iii) the acquisition and conversion of certain outstanding notes, with each 1.00 of debt converted into 2.00 of common stock at market price; (iv) an adjustment to current market price of certain outstanding pre-funded warrants held by the Investor having a current cash value of approximately 2.2 million; and (v) the implementation of a 50 million ELOC pursuant to which the Company may require the Investor to purchase common stock from time-to-time in the amounts and for the prices determined in accordance with the terms of the ELOC. Before the ELOC may be fully utilized, shares subject to the ELOC must be registered for resale and the Company must obtain consent from stockholders to issue shares in excess of 19.99 of the Company s common stock as of the date of the ELOC. The Investor was also required to engage in good faith best efforts to prepay or otherwise acquire outstanding notes held by Esousa, given among other things the failure to achieve quorum at the special meeting called to approve the Esousa transaction and the restrictions on the issuance of additional shares until after such time as such stockholder approval is obtained. The full initial amounts due under the Master Agreement were not yet paid to the Company and Esousa s notes remained outstanding, when the Company received claims from certain existing investors alleging that the Master Agreement violated the terms of their existing investments and Esousa enjoined us from issuing future securities, with certain exceptions, during the Restricted Period. The Company called a special stockholder meeting to approve the securities issuable upon conversion of the Esousa notes, which had been scheduled to take place on September 27, 2024. The proxy statement relating to such meeting requested approval of securities issuances in other capital raising transactions as well, which would have facilitated certain transactions under the Master Agreement. However, the Company was unable to achieve quorum and was forced to adjourn, and then ultimately cancel, the special meeting. The Company timely filed a registration statement, which it anticipates will be effective during the fourth quarter of 2024 and has filed a proxy statement for a second stockholder meeting to approve, among other things, the issuances of shares in connection with the Esousa and Liqueous transactions, which is scheduled to take place on December 27, 2024. The Company has negotiated financing transactions that would provide capital necessary to continue its path to commercialization; however, if the Company is unable to obtain the required stockholder approval to issue additional securities (and consent from certain investors with additional contractual rights to the extent required) or the counter parties do not perform under the terms of such financing agreements, the Company will not be able to sustain operations and will need to consider alternatives, which could include a sale, liquidation, or dissolution of the business or a foreclosure by its senior secured creditors. 
 NYSE American Delisting and Reinstatement 
 On June 13, 2024, NYSE American LLC announced that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist our Common Stock. Trading of our stock on NYSE American was immediately suspended and we commenced trading on the over-the-counter market. 
 On July 29, 2024, we received a notification from NYSE American informing us that we had resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to low selling price as described in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide. As a result, the staff of NYSE Regulation withdrew its delisting determination and lifted the trading suspension on Nuburu s Common Stock. The Common Stock re-commenced trading on NYSE American on Friday, August 2, 2024 under the symbol BURU. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Commercial Launch of Products 
 In 2022 and early 2023, we began the production and shipment of our AO-650 laser. We announced the commercial launch of the first laser in the NUBURU BL TM series, the BL-250, in January 2023. We announced the commercial launch of the BL-1Kw in June 2023 and in the early second quarter of 2024, we expanded our BL product line to include the BL-300. We have shifted our future focus to manufacturing and shipping the BL series. 
 Adoption of our Blue Laser Technology 
 We believe that Nuburu blue laser technology offers a superior solution to improving a variety of aspects of welding and 3D printing, particularly in the manufacturing of batteries, consumer electronics, electric vehicles, renewable energy products and displays. However, our financial results will depend on the 
 32 

Table of Contents 

degree to which potential and current customers recognize the benefits of our blue laser technology and invest in our products. The selection process for our products is lengthy, typically up to 22-24 months, and may require us to incur costs in pursuing opportunities with no assurance that our products will be selected. 
 Capital Equipment 
 Our business is expected to depend substantially on capital expenditures by end users, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive (particularly electric vehicles), other transportation, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor, and electronics. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by end users of materials processing equipment and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending. 
 Recent inflationary pressures are resulting in global central banks adopting less accommodating monetary policies and increasing interest rates. Higher interest rates could impact global growth and could lead to a recession that may reduce the investment in capital equipment. In addition, higher interest rates would increase the cost of equipment financed with leases or debt. 
 Establishing Manufacturing Capacity 
 Nuburu s lasers are designed to be compatible with automated manufacturing methods. Nuburu continually improves the design of its lasers as well as the automation equipment required to manufacture these systems. We expect to work to reduce waste and limit costs while developing robust manufacturing processes with the aim of enhancing our competitive advantage in the marketplace. To do this, we are incorporating the Six Sigma Lean methodologies as well as ISO quality standards to ensure we meet customer expectations. With Six Sigma, we expect to further improve the quality of our products and decrease the variations that cause rework or defects. By incorporating the 5S pillars of the Six Sigma process into our day-to-day work life, we expect to develop a streamlined productive work environment ensuring organized and improved cycle times, with the aim of reducing the cost of goods sold. Through these tools we aim to create an environment that demands quality and performance, while reducing downtime and defects that are generated from undefined processes and underutilized talent. 
 As described above, during 2024 management initiated measures designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees. This significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024. If we are able to obtain sufficient funding for operations, we anticipate that as we ramp up our manufacturing, we will require additional engineers and production personnel to build out and then operate our manufacturing capabilities. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. We believe that these investments will sustain our position as a leader in the blue laser industry and will support the development of new products that can address new markets and growth opportunities. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. 
 Inflationary Pressure 
 The U.S. economy has experienced increased inflation recently, including as a result of expansive monetary policy. Our cost to manufacture our systems is heavily influenced by the cost of the key components and materials used in each system, cost of labor, as well as cost of equipment.

Components of Statements of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Revenue consists of revenue recognized from sales and installation services of high-powered lasers. We have customers in the United States, Europe and Asia. In all sales arrangements, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of materials, overhead and employee compensation associated with the manufacturing of our high-powered lasers. Product cost also includes lower of cost or net realizable value inventory LCNRV adjustments if the carrying value of the inventory is greater than its net realizable value. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits, training, travel, third-party consulting services and laboratory supplies incurred to further our commercialization development efforts. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We anticipate research and development expenses to increase significantly as we expand our product portfolio. 
 As described above, during 2024, management initiated measures designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees. This significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Selling and Marketing 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for our direct sales force, sales management and marketing, and include stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel expenses. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs related to trade shows and marketing programs. We expense selling and marketing costs as incurred. We expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as we expand our sales force, marketing, and customer support organizations and increase our participation in trade shows and marketing programs. 
 As described above, during 2024, management initiated measures designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees. This significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024. 
 General and Administrative 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for our finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, and include stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel expenses. In addition, general and administrative expenses include our third-party consulting and advisory services, legal, audit, accounting services and facilities costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. 
 As described above, during 2024, management initiated measures designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees. This significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024.

Revenue. Revenue decreased 186,743 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily to the measures implemented by management during 2024 designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees that significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024, as described above. 
 Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased 755,753 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a period-over-period decrease of (i) direct labor of approximately 383,000 due to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the third quarter of 2024, as further discussed above, and (ii) direct job costs and materials of approximately 326,000 due to decreased production of the laser systems related to the measures implemented by management during 2024 designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees that significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024, as described above. 
 Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased 1,141,976 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to (i) approximately 1,010,000 of lower personnel costs due to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the third quarter of 2024, as further discussed above, (ii) approximately 117,000 of lower spend on the BL TM series as it transitioned to production in 2023 and (iii) approximately 115,000 lower software, consulting, and other costs. 
 Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 410,182 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to lower personnel costs due to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the third quarter of 2024, as further discussed above, as well as lower consulting expenses. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 394,520 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in compliance costs, which were heightened during the 2023 period due to the Business Combination, and a decrease in personnel costs due to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the third quarter of 2024, as further discussed above, partially offset by an increase in professional service costs. 
 Interest Income. Interest income decreased 46,277 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to lower cash balances between periods. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 766,281 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher debt balances between periods. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was comprised of interest accrued on the Senior Convertible Notes and Junior Notes and the debt discount amortization for the Junior Notes. Refer to Note 8 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Note 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information on our debt obligations. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. We recorded a gain of 369,674 in the third quarter of 2024, which resulted from the decrease in the fair value of the Company's liability-classified warrants between June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a gain of 167,108 due to the decrease in the fair value of the Public Warrants between June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Public Warrants have a zero value due to being delisted from the NYSE American, as further discussed in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability. We recorded a gain of 141,100 in the third quarter of 2024, which resulted from the decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability from the time of the issuance of the August 2024 Convertible Notes in August 2024 through September 30, 2024. There was no derivative liability recorded during the third quarter of 2023. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. We recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 1,339,017 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily relates to the issuance of 2,399,850 shares to noteholders of the Senior Notes and Junior Notes to extinguish an aggregate amount of 677,061 of principal and accrued interest under the Senior Notes and Junior Notes. For further information, see note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Revenue. Revenue decreased 1,567,967 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily to the measures implemented by management during 2024 designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees that significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024, as described above. 
 Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased 2,862,772 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a period-over-period decrease of approximately 3,018,000 of direct job costs and materials due to decreased production of the laser systems related to the measures implemented by management during 2024 designed to reduce costs, which included implementing a furlough of employees that significantly impacted commercialization and operations, particularly in the third quarter of 2024, as described above. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately 128,000 of other overhead costs period-over-period.

Table of Contents 

Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased 2,643,816 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to (i) approximately 1,897,000 of lower personnel costs due to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the first three quarters of 2024, as further discussed above, (ii) approximately 541,000 of lower spend on the BL TM series as it transitioned to production in 2023 and (iii) approximately 206,000 lower software, materials and consulting costs. 
 Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 680,324 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to lower personnel costs related to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the first three quarters of 2024, as further discussed above, and the reversal of stock compensation expense due to the departure of our Chief Marketing and Sales Officer in April 2024 and the resultant forfeiture of his unvested awards, and a decrease in consulting costs. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 1,468,429 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in compliance costs and professional fees, which were heightened during the 2023 period due to the Business Combination, and a decrease in personnel costs due to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the third quarter of 2024, as further discussed above. 
 Interest Income. Interest income decreased 74,712 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to lower cash balances between periods. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 2,646,378 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher debt balances between periods. Interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 was comprised of interest accrued on the Senior Convertible Notes and Junior Notes and debt discount amortization for the Junior Notes. Interest expense for the nine three months of 2023 comprised of interest accrued on the Senior Convertible Notes, which were issued in June 2023. Refer to Note 8 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Note 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information on our debt obligations. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. We recorded a gain of 2,156,186 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted from the decrease in the fair value of the Company's liability-classified warrants between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, we recorded a gain of 1,002,647 due to the decrease in the fair value of the Public Warrants between the Closing and September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Public Warrants have a zero value due to being delisted from the NYSE American, as further discussed in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability. We recorded a gain of 141,100 during the nine months ended September 30,2 024, which resulted from the decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability from the time of the issuance of the August 2024 Convertible Notes in August 2024 through September 30, 2024. There was no derivative liability recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. We recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 11,685,125 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The majority of this loss is related to (i) the issuance of 2,248,312 shares to noteholders to extinguish 4.0 million of principal of Senior Notes and Junior Notes, as well as 106,050 of interest accrued on the Senior Notes and (ii) the issuance of 2,399,850 shares to noteholders of the Senior Notes and Junior Notes to extinguish an aggregate amount of 677,061 of principal and accrued interest under the Senior Notes and Junior Notes. For further information, see note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consisted of a 218,169 gain related to an Employee Retention Tax Credit for qualifying 2021 wages received during the first nine months of 2024, which was accounted for when collectability was assured. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations, and other commitments. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have yet to generate meaningful revenue from our business operations and have funded capital expenditure and working capital requirements through debt and equity financing. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 232,075, as compared to 2,148,700 as of December 31, 2023. Our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our current operating model and expansion plans. On the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company must also, under certain circumstances, redeem the maximum portion of the Preferred Stock as permitted by law in cash at an amount equal to the Original Issuance Price as of such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to redeem any shares of Preferred Stock to the extent the Company does not have legally available funds to effect such redemption. 
 From inception through September 30, 2024, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have incurred operating losses, including net losses of 22,765,563 and 15,959,530, respectively, and we have an accumulated deficit of 120,052,352 as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate that we will incur net losses for the foreseeable future and, even if we increase our revenue, there is no guarantee that it will ever become profitable. All of the aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are able to obtain sufficient funding, we expect to continue to expand our operations, including by investing in manufacturing, sales and marketing, research and development and infrastructure to support our growth.

Table of Contents 

Until we can generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures, we will rely on private and public capital raising efforts; however, there is no assurance that plans to obtain additional debt or equity financing will be successfully implemented or implemented on terms favorable to the Company. 
 The further development of our products, commencement of commercial operations and expansion of our business will require a significant amount of cash for expenditures. Our ability to successfully manage this growth will depend on many factors, including our working capital needs, the availability of equity or debt financing and, over time, our ability to generate cash flows from operations. 
 Given the Company s current liquidity position, the Company will need to raise additional capital. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, this would result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing any additional preferred stock, such securities may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of Common Stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, such debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of Common Stock. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of uncertainty that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented.

Net cash provided by financing activities 

3,583,214 

13,148,567 

Cash flows from operating activities 
 Our cash flows used in operating activities to date have been primarily comprised of costs related to research and development, selling and marketing, and other general and administrative activities. We expect our expenses related to personnel, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative activities to increase as a result of operating as a public company. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 5,499,839 and 13,259,181 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net cash flows used in operating activities is primarily driven by decreased operating expenses and changes in working capital, partially offset by decreases in revenue. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Our cash flows from investing activities have been comprised primarily of purchases of equipment and installation of improvements to our leased facilities and headquarters. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was nil and 1,142,910 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the purchase of equipment to build out our production line. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of stock and promissory notes. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 3,583,214 and 13,148,567 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing in activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised primarily of proceeds from the issuance of pre-funded warrants and Common Stock of 2,139,866 and 200,000, respectively, as well as proceeds from debt borrowings of 743,000 and proceeds from shareholder advances of 645,036, partially offset by payments of accrued debt issuance costs for the Junior Notes totaling 71,500 and tax withholdings for RSU issuances totaling 73,088. 
 Net cash provided by financing in activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is comprised of proceeds received from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and warrants, proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, and the proceeds received from the Closing of the Business Combination. These combined proceeds were partially offset by payments of transaction costs associated with the Business Combination. 
 Key Operating and Financial Metrics (Non-GAAP Results) 
 We regularly review several metrics, including the metrics presented in the table below, to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. The calculation of the key metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly-titled metrics used by other companies.

(1) EBITDA and Free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Information below for our definitions of, and additional information about, EBITDA and Free cash flow and for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, which are net loss and net cash used in operating activities, respectively. 
 Non-GAAP Information 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively and in context, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies that may present similar non-GAAP financial measures. 
 EBITDA and Free Cash Flow 
 We define EBITDA as income (loss), plus (minus) depreciation and amortization expenses, plus (minus) interest, plus (minus) taxes and define Free cash flow as net cash from (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. EBITDA and Free cash flow are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP and these measures should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss), and net cash used in operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. Our computation of EBITDA and Free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA or Free cash flow in the same fashion. 
 Limitations of Non-GAAP Measures 
 There are a number of limitations related to EBITDA, including the following: 
 EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets. While these are non-cash charges, we may need to replace the assets being depreciated and amortized in the future and EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for these replacements or new capital expenditure requirements. 

EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, net, which may constitute a significant recurring expense in the future. 

Free cash flow does not reflect the impact of equity or debt raises or repayment of debt or dividends paid. 

Because of these and other limitations, EBITDA and Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Free cash flow on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of our net loss to EBITDA and net loss to Free cash flow below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 Our presentation of EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items and our presentation of Free cash flow does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund our cash needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 
 For our contractual obligations that are expected to have an effect on our liquidity and cash flow, see section Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no significant changes to our accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting estimates described in our audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, and as subsequently amended by the Form 10-K/As filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024, August 12, 2024 and September 6, 2024.

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 We review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each new standard will have. For the recently issued and adopted accounting standards that we believe may have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements, see the section entitled Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to a material weakness in our control environment around the accounting and presentation of complex financial instrument transactions that was not effectively designed or maintained. This material weakness resulted in the restatements of the Company s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the comparative period therein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for each of the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023 (as filed on Amendment No. 4 on Form 10-K/A on November 8, 2024), March 31, 2024 (as filed on Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A on November 14, 2024) and June 30, 2024 (as filed on Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A on November 14, 2024). Additionally, this material weakness could result in material misstatements of the financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we intend to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2025: (i) hire additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are dependent upon our receiving additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. 
 See Note 15, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements and Previously Issued Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER IN FORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Pr oceedings. 
 The information under the caption Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings. The Company will accrue a liability for legal proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was not involved in any material legal proceedings. 
 Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, despite the Company calling a meeting of stockholders to approve the Esousa transaction (which failed for lack of achieving quorum) and expending significant efforts to satisfy required conditions, Esousa filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and enjoined the Company from issuing additional securities until such stockholder approval and other requirements are satisfied, significantly impacting the Company s ability to raise capital critical to operations. Esousa subsequently settled its claims for a payment of 50,000 and a future payment of 100,000 upon the consummation of the very transactions it sought to enjoin in its complaint. 
 Item 1A. Risk F actors. 
 In addition to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should consider the following risk factor, which supplements those contained in in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our most recently filed Amended 10-K, in evaluating our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in the shares of our company. Other than the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Amended 10-K. If any of the risks discussed in our Amended 10-K are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We have had to restate previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reporting and prevent fraud. 
 On October 21, 2024, our Board of Directors and management, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the comparative period therein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the interim quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024 should no longer be relied upon due to material weaknesses in our control environment related to the accounting and presentation of complex financial instrument transactions, as further described in Note 15, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements and Previously Issued Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 To remediate such weaknesses, we intend to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2025: (i) hire additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. These remediation measures may be time-consuming and costly, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate or are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations or enforcement actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 
 We can provide no assurance that the measures that we plan to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or a circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Eq uity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 Descriptions of the April 2024 SPA Agreement, Warrant Issuances, Note Extinguishments and August 2024 Convertible Notes described above under " Recent Developments ", as well as share-based compensation arrangements described in Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation , to the condensed consolidated financial statements are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) GOOD FAITH ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE OTHER DISPUTES. If either the Company or the Investor believes that a dispute not covered by Section 10.15(b) has arisen under these Transaction Documents, that party, prior to commencing arbitration, must provide the other side with written notice detailing the nature of the alleged dispute. Upon receipt of such written notice, the parties are required to engage in good faith negotiations in an attempt to resolve the dispute for a period of not less than fourteen (14) days, such time as may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.

(d) ARBITRATION .

(e) COSTS AND AWARD. Each side must bear its own costs and legal fees during the pendency of the arbitration. A party s failure to pay any costs or fees required to proceed in the arbitration, as they timely come due, shall result in an immediate default against that party. The prevailing party in the arbitration shall be entitled to recoup all its reasonable attorneys fees and costs from the non- prevailing party, including, without limitation, all of its costs relating to the arbitration, excluding only the costs incurred in connection with the procedures of Section 10.15(b) . The arbitrator s final award shall include this assessment of costs and fees. That award also shall include interest from the date of any damages incurred for breach of these Transaction Documents, and from the date of the award until paid in full assessed at the 

24 

prevailing statutory rate. The non-prevailing party must promptly pay that award in Dollars, free of any tax, deduction or offset.

With respect to damages, the only damages recoverable under these Transaction Documents are compensatory; both the Company and the Investor expressly disclaim the right to seek punitive or other exemplary damages. 

(f) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Provided a party has made a sufficient showing under applicable law, the arbitrator shall have the freedom to invoke, and the parties agree to abide by, injunctive measures that either party submits in writing for arbitration claims requiring immediate relief. Additionally, nothing in this Section 10.15 shall preclude either party from seeking equitable relief or interim or provisional relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim equitable relief, concerning a dispute either prior to or during arbitration if necessary to protect the interests of such party or to preserve the status quo pending the arbitration proceeding. 

(g) CONFIDENTIALITY. The arbitration proceeding and subsequent award shall be confidential. The arbitrator shall issue appropriate protective orders to safeguard each party s confidential information. Except as required by law (or if necessary to enforce the award), including without limitation securities regulations, neither party is to make any public announcement with respect to the proceedings or decision of the arbitrator without the prior written consent of the other party. The existence of any dispute submitted to arbitration, and the award, shall be kept in confidence by the parties and the arbitrator, except as required in connection with the enforcement of such an award or as otherwise required by law.

(f) The Company shall notify Legal Counsel and the Investor in writing of the happening of any event, as promptly as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such event, as a result of which the Prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and, subject to Section 3(q), promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement and such Prospectus contained therein to correct such untrue statement or omission and deliver one (1) electronic copy of such supplement or amendment to Legal Counsel and the Investor (or such other number of copies as Legal Counsel or the Investor may reasonably request).

(i) Without limiting any obligation of the Company under the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts either to (i) cause all of the Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement to be listed on the Trading Market, or (ii) secure designation and quotation of all of the Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement on another Eligible Market.

(k) Upon the written request of the Investor, the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of notice from the Investor and subject to Section 3(p) hereof, (i) incorporate in a Prospectus Supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the Investor reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; (ii) make all required filings of such Prospectus Supplement or post-effective amendment after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus Supplement or post-effective amendment; and (iii) supplement or make amendments to any Registration Statement or Prospectus contained therein if reasonably requested by the Investor. 

(l) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities. 

(m) The Company shall make generally available to its security holders (which may be satisfied by making such information available on EDGAR) as soon as practical, but not later than ninety (90) days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with, and in the manner provided by, the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company s fiscal quarter next following the applicable Effective Date of each Registration Statement. 

(n) The Company shall otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission in connection with any registration hereunder. 

(o) Within one (1) Business Day after each Registration Statement which covers Registrable Securities is declared effective by the Commission, the Company shall deliver, and shall cause legal counsel for the Company to deliver, to the transfer agent for such Registrable Securities (with copies to the Investor) confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A . 

(p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject to the last sentence of this Section 3(p)), at any time after the Effective Date of a particular Registration Statement, the Company may, upon written notice to Investor, suspend Investor s use of any prospectus that is a part of any Registration Statement (in which event the Investor shall discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement, but shall settle any previously made sales of Registrable Securities) if the Company (x) is pursuing an acquisition, merger, tender offer, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and the Company determines in good faith that (A) the Company s ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in such Registration Statement or other registration statement or (B) such transaction renders the Company unable to comply with Commission requirements, in each case under circumstances that would make it impractical or inadvisable to cause any Registration Statement (or such filings) to be used by Investor or to promptly amend or supplement any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement on a post effective basis, as applicable, or (y) has experienced some other material non-public event the 

10 

disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the Company, would materially adversely affect the Company (each, an Allowable Grace Period ); provided, however , that in no event shall the Investor be suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement for a period that exceeds twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days or an aggregate of sixty (60) days in any 365-day period; and provided, further , the Company shall not effect any such suspension during (A) the first ten (10) consecutive Trading Days after the Effective Date of the particular Registration Statement, (B) the five (5)-Trading Day period commencing on the Commencement Date, or (C) the five (5)-Trading Day period commencing on the Purchase Date for each Purchase. Upon disclosure of such information or the termination of the condition described above, the Company shall provide prompt notice, but in any event within one Business Day of such disclosure or termination, to the Investor and shall promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other reasonable actions to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement (including as set forth in the first sentence of Section 3(f) with respect to the information giving rise thereto unless such material, non-public information is no longer applicable). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3(p), the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver DWAC Shares to a transferee of the Investor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which (i) the Company has made a sale to Investor and (ii) the Investor has entered into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the Prospectus included as part of the particular Registration Statement to the extent applicable, in each case prior to the Investor s receipt of the notice of an Allowable Grace Period and for which the Investor has not yet settled. 

4. Obligations of the Investor . 

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of each Registration Statement (or such shorter period to which the parties agree), the Company shall notify the Investor in writing of the information the Company requires from the Investor with respect to such Registration Statement. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to complete the registration pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities of the Investor that the Investor shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities held by it, as shall be reasonably required to effect and maintain the effectiveness of the registration of such Registrable Securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request. 

(b) The Investor, by its acceptance of the Registrable Securities, agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of each Registration Statement hereunder, unless the Investor has notified the Company in writing of the Investor s election to exclude all of the Investor s Registrable Securities from such Registration Statement. 

11 

(c) The Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(p) or the first sentence of 3(f), the Investor shall immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement(s) covering such Registrable Securities until the Investor s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(p) or the first sentence of Section 3(f) or receipt of notice that no supplement or amendment is required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(c), the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver DWAC Shares to a transferee of the Investor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which the Investor has entered into a contract for sale prior to the Investor s receipt of a notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(p) or the first sentence of Section 3(f) and for which the Investor has not yet settled. 

(d) The Investor covenants and agrees that it shall comply with the prospectus delivery and other requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement.

12 

which Registrable Securities are offered Blue Sky Filing ), or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) or in any Prospectus Supplement or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being, collectively, Violations ). Subject to Section 6(e), the Company shall reimburse the Investor Parties, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a): (i) shall not apply to a Claim by an Investor Party arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Investor Party for such Investor Party expressly for use in connection with the preparation of such Registration Statement, Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto (it being hereby acknowledged and agreed that the written information set forth on Exhibit C attached hereto is the only written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement); (ii) shall not be available to the Investor to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of the Investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) made available by the Company (to the extent applicable), including, without limitation, a corrected Prospectus, if such Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) or corrected Prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d) and then only if, and to the extent that, following the receipt of the corrected Prospectus no grounds for such Claim would have existed; and (iii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Investor Party and shall survive the transfer of any of the Registrable Securities by the Investor pursuant to Section 9. 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Investor is participating, the Investor agrees to severally and not jointly indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section 6(a), the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an Company Party ), against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case, to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to the Investor furnished to the Company by the Investor expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement, the Prospectus included therein or any Prospectus Supplement thereto (it being hereby acknowledged and agreed that the written information set forth on Exhibit C attached hereto is the only written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement); and, subject to Section 6(e) and the below provisos in this Section 6(b), the Investor shall reimburse a Company Party any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Company Party in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; provided , however , the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained 

13 

in Section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and provided, further that the Investor shall be liable under this Section 6(b) for only that amount of a Claim or Indemnified Damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to the Investor as a result of the applicable sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Company Party and shall survive the transfer of any of the Registrable Securities by the Investor pursuant to Section 9. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an Investor Party or Company Party (as the case may be) under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including, without limitation, any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Investor Party or Company Party (as the case may be) shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Investor Party or the Company Party (as the case may be); provided , however , an Investor Party or Company Party (as the case may be) shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the indemnifying party if: (i) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Claim and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Investor Party or Company Party (as the case may be) in any such Claim; or (iii) the named parties to any such Claim (including, without limitation, any impleaded parties) include both such Investor Party or Company Party (as the case may be) and the indemnifying party, and such Investor Party or such Company Party (as the case may be) shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Investor Party or such Company Party and the indemnifying party (in which case, if such Investor Party or such Company Party (as the case may be) notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, then the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof on behalf of the indemnified party and such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party, provided further that in the case of clause (iii) above the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one (1) separate legal counsel for all Investor Parties or Company Parties (as the case may be). The Company Party or Investor Party (as the case may be) shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Company Party or Investor Party (as the case may be) which relates to such action or Claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the Company Party or Investor Party (as the case may be) reasonably apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent; provided , however , the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the Company Party or Investor Party (as the case may be), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Company Party or Investor Party (as the case may be) of a release from all liability in respect to such Claim or litigation, and such settlement shall not include any admission as to fault on the part of the Company Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence shall apply to Sections 6(a) and 6(b) hereof. Following 

14 

indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Company Party or Investor Party (as the case may be) with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Investor Party or Company Party (as the case may be) under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially and adversely prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. 

(d) No Person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities who is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to indemnification from any Person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who is not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.

(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Company Party or Investor Party against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law. 

7. Contribution . 

To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided , however : (i) no contribution shall be made under circumstances where the maker would not have been liable for indemnification under the fault standards set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement, (ii) no Person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities which Person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution from any Person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (iii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the amount of net proceeds received by such seller from the applicable sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Investor shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by the Investor from the applicable sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the Claim exceeds the amount of any damages that the Investor has otherwise been required to pay, or would otherwise be required to pay under Section 6(b), by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

It is accordingly agreed that either party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or cure breaches of the provisions of this Agreement by the other party and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required), this being in addition to any other remedy to which either party may be entitled by law or equity. 

(d) All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts sitting in The City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address for such notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in that jurisdiction or the validity or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

17 

implication that the contrary would otherwise be true, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit, modify or affect in any manner whatsoever (i) the conditions precedent to a Purchase contained in Article VII of the Purchase Agreement or (ii) any of the Company s obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
