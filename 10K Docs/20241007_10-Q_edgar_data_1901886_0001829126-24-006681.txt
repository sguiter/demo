Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Aura FAT Projects Capital LLC generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of . 

Transaction costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees paid in cash, of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trust Account )), and of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Cash of was held outside of the Trust Account on August 31, 2024 and was available for working capital purposes. As described in Note 6, the deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination. 

The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will complete the initial Business Combination only if the post-Business Combination company in which its public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. 

Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in a trust account Trust Account and may only be invested in United States government securities within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its tax obligations and up to of interest that may be used for its dissolution expenses, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or certain amendments to the memorandum and articles of association prior thereto or to redeem 100 of the public shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) (the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-Business Combination activity, and (c) the redemption of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of its public shareholders. 

The Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the Company to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or share exchange listing requirements. 

The public shareholders are entitled to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be 10.20 per public share, however, there is no guarantee that investors will receive 10.20 per share upon redemption. 

The shares of ordinary share subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company s Class A ordinary shares are not classified as a penny stock upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

The Company will have only 15 months (or up to a 21-month if the Company chooses to extend such period, as described in more detail in the final prospectus, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination. On July 17, 2023, the Company held a special meeting (the Special Meeting where its shareholders approved the proposal (the Trust Amendment Proposal to authorize the Company to enter into Amendment No. 1 to the Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement Amendment to amend the Trust Agreement to allow the Company to extend beyond July 18, 2023 the date by which the Company must have completed its initial business combination. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement Amendment, the Company has the right to extend beyond July 18, 2023 (the Original Termination Date by up to 12, 1-month extensions through July 18, 2024 (each of the 12, 1-month extensions, an Extension , and each such extended date a Deadline Date the date by which the Company must consummate the initial Business Combination and the Sponsor will deposit into the Trust Account the lesser of (x) or (y) per share for each Public Share outstanding as of the applicable Deadline Date for each one-month extension (the Extension Payment (the Extension Amendment Proposal ). If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company s obligations under the laws of Cayman Islands to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At the Special Meeting, shareholders also approved the NTA Amendment to remove from the existing charter the following limitations: (i) that the Company will only redeem offering shares so long as (after such redemption), the Company s net tangible assets NTA will be at least or any greater NTA or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to an initial business combination and after payment of the underwriters fees and commission (the Redemption Limitation ), (ii) that the Company shall not redeem offering shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination if the Redemption Limitation is exceeded, and (iii) that the Company shall not consummate a business combination pursuant to a tender offer if the Redemption Limitation is exceeded (the NTA Proposal ). In connection with the voting on the NTA Proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposal, and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Special Meeting, holders of shares of Class A ordinary shares exercised the right to redeem such shares for a payment of or approximately per share. 

On July 19, 2024, in connection with the voting on the NTA Proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposal, and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Special Meeting, holders of shares of Class A ordinary shares exercised the right to redeem such shares for a payment of or approximately per share. The vote allows the Company to extend beyond July 18, 2024 the date by which the Company must have completed its initial business combination. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement Amendment, the Company has the right to extend the Deadline Date by up to 12, 1-month extensions through July 18, 2025. 

The Sponsor, officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with Company, pursuant to which they will agree to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior thereto or to redeem 100 of the public shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period for each three month extension, into the Trust Account, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Class A ordinary shares and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares held by them if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period although the Company will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. 

On December 11, 2023, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq indicating that since the Company s Market Value of Listed Securities was less than million, the Company was no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Global Market continued listing criteria set forth in Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), which requires the Company to maintain a Market Value of Listed Securities of at least 50 million (the MVLS Notice ). The MVLS Notice additionally indicates that the Company, pursuant to the Listing Rules, has a compliance period of 180 calendar days in which it can regain compliance. Further, the MVLS Notice states that, if at any time during the compliance period the Company closes at 50 million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. 

On each of December 15, 2023, January 17, 2024, February 14, 2024, March 14, 2024, April 19, 2024, May 17, 2024, and June 18, 2024 the Company deposited into the Company s Trust Account for its public shareholders, allowing the Company to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination by seven additional months from December 18, 2023 to August 18, 2024. On each of August 14, 2024 and September 23, 2024, the Company deposited into the Company s Trust Account for its public shareholders, allowing the Company to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination to October 18, 2024. 

Going Concern Consideration 

As of August 31, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and working capital deficit of . 

Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

The Company expects to incur significant costs
in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business
combination. The Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor,
shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated
to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to
meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the
Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could
include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing
overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable
terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to complete the Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available,
the Company will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In connection with the Company s assessment of
going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company
is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete an Initial Business Combination by
July 18, 2024 then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. On July 17, 2023, the
Company amended the Company governing documents to allow for twelve 1-month extensions by depositing the lesser of (x) ,
or (y) 
per share for each public share outstanding as of the applicable Deadline Date into trust for each extension requested. Currently
extension deposits have been made for extension through October 18, 2024. On July 19, 2024, in connection with the voting on the NTA
Proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposal, and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Special Meeting, holders of shares of
Class A ordinary shares exercised the right to redeem such shares for a payment of or approximately per share.
The Company may extend the time to consummate a Business Combination by twelve (12) one-month (1-month) periods by depositing the
lesser of: (x) , or (y) per share per Extension into the Trust Account before the 18th day of each applicable month. The
liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to consummate a business combination prior to the mandatory
liquidation date. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to
liquidate after October 18, 2024. 

Business Combination Agreement 

On May 7, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the Agreement with Allrites Holdings Pte Ltd., a Singapore private company limited by shares, Allrites ), and Meta Gold Pte. Ltd., a Singapore exempt private company limited by shares, as the representative for the shareholders of Allrites (See Note 6). 

On September 14, 2023, the Company signed a convertible promissory note with the Sponsor for for working capital purposes. The note is non-interest bearing and payable upon liquidation or completion of a Business Combination (see Note 5). 

Risks and Uncertainties 

Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of this financial statement.

On each of August 14, 2024 and September 23, 2024, the Company deposited 5,000 into the Company s Trust Account for its public shareholders, allowing the Company to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination to October 18, 2024. 

23 

On July 24, 2024, the Company and the Underwriter, collectively the Parties further entered into a Deed of Satisfaction and Discharge of Indebtedness (Deed) in relation to the Deferred Underwriting Fee upon completion of the Company s Business Combination. The Deed outlines the steps and fulfilment of the Deferred Underwriting Fee based on select scenarios upon Business Combination, in particular the financial obligations of the Deferred Underwriting Fee will be satisfied in combination of cash and scrip of the Company. 

In the event of a Business Combination, the Underwriter shall receive up to the maximum of 402,500 in cash from available funds in the Trust Account only, and the balance of the Deferred Underwriting Fee shall be issued in Company scrip. If a PIPE is delivered as part of the Business Combination, the Underwriter will instead be entitled to a maximum of 500,000 in cash from available funds in the Trust Account, with the balance of the Deferred Underwriting Fee issued in Company scrip. The Underwriter shall be entitled to a PIPE placement fee in addition to the Deferred Underwriting Fee. If there is insufficient amount in Trust Account to satisfy the cash obligations of the above scenarios, the unpaid cash balance shall be accrued at an interest rate of 9 per annum and be paid from the proceeds of the next financing event by the Company. 

At the Special Meeting, shareholders also approved the NTA Amendment to remove from the existing charter the following limitations: (i) that the Company will only redeem offering shares so long as (after such redemption), the Company s net tangible assets NTA will be at least 5,000,001 or any greater NTA or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to an initial business combination and after payment of the underwriters fees and commission (the Redemption Limitation ), (ii) that the Company shall not redeem offering shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination if the Redemption Limitation is exceeded, and (iii) that the Company shall not consummate a business combination pursuant to a tender offer if the Redemption Limitation is exceeded (the NTA Proposal ). In connection with the voting on the NTA Proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposal, and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Special Meeting, holders of 8,708,304 shares of Class A ordinary shares exercised the right to redeem such shares for a payment of 92,514,424 or approximately 10.62 per share.

These advances are non-interest bearing and payable the earlier of the closing of the merger or July 18, 2024.

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from December 6, 2021 (inception) through August 31, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, we had a net loss of 119,529, which consists of an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 12,045 and operating costs of 370,232, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 261,486, interest earned on note receivable of 1,262. 

For the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we had a net income of 323,669, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,085,980 and interest earned on note receivable of 3,768, offset by operating costs of 766,079. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2023, we had a net income of 553,286, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,009,563 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 9,101, offset by operating and formation costs of 465,378. 

For the nine months ended August 31, 2023, we had a net income of 2,358,955, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,687,468 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 3,730, offset by operating and formation costs of 1,332,243. 

26 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On April 18, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, at a price of 10.00 per Unit, which includes the exercise of the over-allotment option in full of 1,500,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private sale of 5,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of 5,000,000. 

Following the Initial Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Units, a total of 117,300,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 5,724,785 in Initial Public Offering related costs, including 1,150,000 of underwriting fees and 4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fees and 549,785 of other offering costs. 

For the nine months ended August 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 339,969. Net income of 323,669 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,085,980. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 422,342 of cash for operating activities. 

For the nine months ended August 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 540,784. Net income of 2,358,955 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,687,468 and unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust account of 3,730. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 791,459 of cash for operating activities. 

As of August 31, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,134,182 (including 322,256 of interest income, net of unrealized losses) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As of August 31, 2024, we had cash of 151,901. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. 

If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. 

27 

In connection with our assessment of going
concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s ability to
Continue as a Going Concern, we have determined that if we are unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs
as well as complete a Business Combination by July 18, 2023, then we will cease all operations except for the purpose of
liquidating. On July 17, 2023, the Company amended the Company governing documents to allow for twelve 1-month extensions by
depositing 50,000 into trust for each extension requested. Currently extension deposits have been made for extension through
July 18, 2024. On July 19, 2024, in connection with the voting on the NTA Proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposal, and the
Trust Amendment Proposal at the special meeting, holders of 2,522,186 shares of Class A ordinary shares exercised the right to
redeem such shares for a payment of 26,268,373 or approximately 10.41 per share. In connection with the Company s charter
approved at the special meeting, the Company may extend the time to consummate a Business Combination by twelve (12) one-month
(1-month) periods by depositing the lesser of: (x) 5,000, or (y) 0.02 per share per Extension into the Trust Account before the
18th day of each applicable month. The liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to consummate a Business Combination prior to the
mandatory liquidation date. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to
liquidate after July 18, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of August 31, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse the Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, and completing an initial Business Combination commencing on the filing of the initial draft registration statement. We began incurring these fees on January 27, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. 

The underwriters will be entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, which aggregates to 4,025,000, upon the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

On July 24, 2024, the Company and the Underwriter, collectively the Parties further entered into a Deed of Satisfaction and Discharge of Indebtedness (Deed) in relation to the Deferred Underwriting Fee upon completion of the Company s Business Combination. The Deed outlines the steps and fulfilment of the Deferred Underwriting Fee based on select scenarios upon Business Combination, in particular the financial obligations of the Deferred Underwriting Fee will be satisfied in combination of cash and scrip of the Company. 

In the event of a Business Combination, the Underwriter shall receive up to the maximum of 402,500 in cash from available funds in the Trust Account only, and the balance of the Deferred Underwriting Fee shall be issued in Company scrip. If a PIPE is delivered as part of the Business Combination, the Underwriter will instead be entitled to a maximum of 500,000 in cash from available funds in the Trust Account, with the balance of the Deferred Underwriting Fee issued in Company scrip. The Underwriter shall be entitled to a PIPE placement fee in addition to the Deferred Underwriting Fee. If there is insufficient amount in Trust Account to satisfy the cash obligations of the above scenarios, the unpaid cash balance shall be accrued at an interest rate of 9 per annum and be paid from the proceeds of the next financing event by the Company. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of unaudited financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s unaudited financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering. The risk factor disclosure in our final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on April 14, 2022, set forth under the heading Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and results of operations is replaced in its entirety with the following risk factor: 

Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and results of operations. 

We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination, and results of operations. 

On March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to, among other items, enhancing disclosures in business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amending the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; effectively limiting the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; increasing the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These rules, if adopted, whether in the form proposed or in revised form, may materially adversely affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. 

The risk factor disclosure in our final prospectus as set forth under the heading If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations is replaced in its entirety with the following risk factor: 

If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. 

If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following: 

costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations and complying with different commercial and legal requirements of overseas markets; 

rules and regulations regarding currency redemption; 

30 

complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals; 

laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected; 

exchange listing and/or delisting requirements; 

tariffs and trade barriers; 

regulations related to customs and import/export matters; 

local or regional economic policies and market conditions; 

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 

longer payment cycles; 

tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; 

currency fluctuations and exchange controls; 

rates of inflation; 

challenges in collecting accounts receivable; 

cultural and language differences; 

employment regulations; 

underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems; 

corruption; 

protection of intellectual property; 

social unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances; 

regime changes and political upheaval; 

terrorist attacks, natural disasters and wars; 

deterioration of political relations with the United States; and 

government appropriation of assets. 

Additionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. Further, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. 

We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On January 7, 2022, we issued an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder Shares to the Sponsor for an aggregate price of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per share, pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such issuances. On April 18, 2022, in connection with the underwriters election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, an aggregate of 375,000 Founder Shares were no longer subject to forfeiture, and 2,875,000 Founder Shares remain outstanding. The Founder Shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. 

On April 18, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,500,000 Units. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of 115,000,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value 0.0001 per share, and one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The warrants will become exercisable at any time commencing on the later of April 18, 2023, 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or the date of the consummation of our initial Business Combination and will expire five years after the consummation of our initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC EF Hutton is acting as the sole book-running manager and as the representative of the underwriters mentioned in the prospectus for the Initial Public Offering. The securities in the offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-263717) (the Registration Statement ). The SEC declared the Registration Statement effective on April 14, 2022. 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 5,000,000 warrants (each, a Private Placement Warrant and, collectively, the Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Aura FAT Projects Capital LLC (the Sponsor ), generating gross proceeds of 5,000,000. The issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the Private Placement. 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except as described below. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The Private Placement Warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the placement warrants) are identical to the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering except that (a) the placement warrants and their component securities will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the consummation of our initial Business Combination, except to permitted transferees, and (b) will be entitled to registration rights.
