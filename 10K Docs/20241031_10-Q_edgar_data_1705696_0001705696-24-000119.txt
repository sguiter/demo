EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of VICI Properties Inc. and VICI Properties L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to VICI mean VICI Properties Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including VICI Properties OP LLC VICI OP ), and references to VICI LP mean VICI Properties L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms the Company, we, our and us mean VICI and VICI LP, including, collectively, their consolidated subsidiaries. 
 In order to highlight the differences between VICI and VICI LP, the separate sections in this report for VICI and VICI LP described below specifically refer to VICI and VICI LP. In the sections that combine disclosure of VICI and VICI LP, this report refers to actions or holdings of VICI and VICI LP as being our actions or holdings. Although VICI LP is the entity that generally, directly or indirectly, enters into contracts and joint ventures, holds assets and incurs debt, we believe that references to we, us or our in this context is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and we operate substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets through VICI LP. 
 VICI is a real estate investment trust REIT that is the sole owner of VICI Properties GP LLC, the sole general partner of VICI LP. As of September 30, 2024, VICI owns 100 of the limited liability company interests of VICI Properties HoldCo LLC HoldCo ), which in turn owns approximately 98.8 of the limited liability company interest of VICI OP (such interests, VICI OP Units ), our operating partnership, which in turns owns 100 of the limited partnership interest in VICI LP. The balance of the VICI OP Units not held by HoldCo are held by third-party unit holders. 
 The following diagram details VICI s organizational structure as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of VICI and VICI LP into this single report: 
 enhances investors understanding of VICI and VICI LP by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 We operate VICI and VICI LP as one business. Because VICI LP is managed by VICI, and VICI conducts substantially all of its operations and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets indirectly through VICI LP, VICI s executive officers are VICI LP s executive officers, although, as a partnership, VICI LP does not have a board of directors. 
 We believe it is important to understand the few differences between VICI and VICI LP in the context of how VICI and VICI LP operate as a consolidated company. VICI is a REIT whose only material assets are its indirect interest in VICI LP, through which it conducts its real property business. VICI also conducts its golf course business through a taxable REIT subsidiary (a TRS ), VICI Golf LLC, a Delaware limited liability company VICI Golf ). As a result, VICI does not conduct business itself other than issuing public equity from time to time and does not directly incur any material indebtedness, rather VICI LP 
 2 

holds substantially all of our assets, except for those held in VICI Golf. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by VICI, VICI LP generates all capital required by the Company s business, which sources include VICI LP s operations and its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness. 
 VICI consolidates VICI LP for financial reporting purposes, and VICI does not have material assets other than its indirect investment in VICI LP. Therefore, while there are some areas of difference between the unaudited consolidated financial statements of VICI and those of VICI LP, the assets and liabilities of VICI and VICI LP are materially the same on their respective financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, the primary areas of difference between the unaudited consolidated financial statements of VICI and those of VICI LP were cash and cash equivalents, stockholders equity and partners capital, non-controlling interests and golf operations, which include the assets and liabilities and income and expenses of VICI Golf. 
 To help investors understand the differences between VICI and VICI LP, this report provides: 
 separate consolidated financial statements for VICI and VICI LP; 
 a single set of notes to such consolidated financial statements that includes separate discussions of stockholders equity or partners equity and per share and per unit data, as applicable; 
 a combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that also includes discrete information related to each entity, as applicable; 
 separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections; 
 separate Part II, Item 2. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities sections related to each entity; and 
 separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of VICI and VICI LP in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that VICI and VICI LP are each compliant with Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. 1350. 
 The separate discussions of VICI and VICI LP in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand our results on a consolidated basis and how management operates our business.

 million of capital investment into the Venetian Resort for extensive reinvestment projects through our Partner Property Growth Fund strategy (the Venetian Capital Investment ). The Venetian Capital Investment will fund several projects, including hotel room product renovations, gaming floor optimization and entertainment and convention center enhancements, among others, seeking to improve the overall guest experience and enhance the value of the property. The invested capital will earn a return through the addition of incremental rent to the lease agreement for the Venetian Resort (as amended in connection with the Venetian Capital Investment, the Venetian Lease ). 
 The up to million of funding through the Venetian Capital Investment is comprised of million that has already been funded and an incremental million that the Venetian Resort will have the option, but not the obligation, to draw in whole or in part until November 1, 2026. The initial million investment was funded based on a fixed schedule: million was funded in the second quarter of 2024, million was funded in the third quarter of 2024 and million was funded on October 1, 2024. The previous Property Growth Fund Agreement entered into with the tenant in connection with the Venetian Resort acquisition in 2021 providing for up to billion of future development and construction project funding was terminated on May 1, 2024 concurrently with the entry into the agreement to fund the Venetian Capital Investment. 
 In connection with the Venetian Capital Investment, annual rent under the Venetian Lease will increase commencing on the first day of the quarter immediately following each capital funding at a yield (the Incremental Venetian Rent ). In addition to any increase pursuant to the Incremental Venetian Rent, annual rent under the Venetian Lease will begin escalating annually at on March 1, 2029 and, commencing on March 1, 2031, will begin escalating on the same terms as the rest of the rent payable under the Venetian Lease with annual escalation equal to the greater of or CPI, capped at . On July 1, 2024, the aggregate annual rent under the Venetian Lease increased by million as a result of the first million funding. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 1, 2024, the aggregate annual rent under the Venetian Lease increased by million as a result of the additional million funding that occurred during the third quarter. 
 We determined that the amendment to the Venetian Lease in connection with the Venetian Capital Investment represented a lease modification under ASC 842 pursuant to which we were required to reassess the lease classification. Upon reassessment, we determined that the Venetian Lease continues to meet the definition of a sales-type lease. Accordingly, since the classification remains unchanged, we modified the future minimum lease cash flows to reflect the amendment and prospectively adjusted the discount rate used to recognize income, incorporating the impact of the additional funding and related incremental rent in connection with the Venetian Capital Investment.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a million increase in our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by initial CECL allowances on our property acquisition and loan origination activity of billion during such period and an increase in the Long-Term Period PD as a result of a standard annual update made to the Long-Term PD default study we utilize to estimate our CECL allowance.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 We assess the credit quality of our investments through the credit ratings of the senior secured debt of the guarantors of our leases, as we believe that our lease agreements have a similar credit profile to a senior secured debt instrument. The credit quality indicators are reviewed by us on a quarterly basis as of quarter-end. In instances where the guarantor of one of our lease agreements does not have senior secured debt with a credit rating, we use either a comparable proxy company or the overall corporate credit rating, as applicable. We also use this credit rating to determine the Long-Term Period PD when estimating credit losses for each investment.

 The Revolving Credit Facility includes maturity extension options, the exercise of which is subject to customary conditions and the payment of an extension fee of on the extended commitments. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility includes the option to increase the revolving loan commitments by up to billion to the extent that any one or more lenders (from the syndicate or otherwise) agree to provide such additional credit extensions.

 We have entered into, and subsequently settled, the following forward-starting derivatives and U.S. Treasury Rate Lock agreements to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates from the trade date through the forecasted issuance of the respective senior unsecured notes. In each case, the derivatives were designated as cash-flow hedges and, accordingly, the unrealized gain in Accumulated other comprehensive income is amortized over the term of the respective derivative instruments, which matches that of the underlying note, as a reduction in interest expense. 
 In connection with our March 2024 Notes offering, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements for a total aggregate notional amount of million, which we settled in March 2024 for total net proceeds of million. 
 In connection with our April 2022 Notes offering, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion and U.S. Treasury Rate Lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million, which we settled in April 2022 for total net proceeds of million.)

As non-derivative net investment hedges, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the principal balances are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million in unrealized losses and million in unrealized gains, respectively, related to such net investment hedges, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized million and million, respectively, in unrealized losses related to such net investment hedges, which were recorded as a component of Foreign currency translation adjustments in the Statement of Operations.

Certain of our acquisitions necessitate that we assume, as the lessee, ground and use leases that are integral to the operations of the property, the cost of which is passed to our tenants through our lease agreements, which require the tenants to pay all costs associated with such ground and use leases and provide for their direct payment to the landlord. 
 We have determined we are the primary obligor of certain of such ground and use leases and, accordingly, have presented these leases on a gross basis on our Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations.

Sales of common stock, if any, made pursuant to the ATM Program may be sold in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings, as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. The ATM Program also provides that the Company may sell shares of its common stock under the ATM Program through forward sale agreements. Actual sales under the ATM Program will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, our capital needs, and our determination of the appropriate sources of funding to meet such needs.

 Earnings Per Unit 
 The following section presents the basic earnings per unit EPU and diluted EPU of VICI OP, our operating partnership and the direct parent and interest holder in VICI LP. VICI LP s interests are not expressed in units. However, given that VICI OP has a unit ownership structure and the financial information of VICI OP is substantially identical with that of VICI LP, we have elected to present the EPU of VICI OP. Basic EPU is computed by dividing net income attributable to partners capital by the weighted-average number of units outstanding during the period. In accordance with the VICI OP limited liability company agreement, for each share of common stock issued at VICI, a corresponding unit is issued by VICI OP. Accordingly, diluted EPU reflects the additional dilution for all potentially dilutive units resulting from potentially dilutive VICI stock issuances, such as options, unvested restricted stock awards, unvested performance-based restricted stock unit awards and units to be issued by us upon settlement of any outstanding forward sale agreements of VICI for the period such dilutive security is outstanding. The units issuable upon settlement of any outstanding forward sale agreements of VICI are reflected in the diluted EPU calculations using the treasury stock method for the period outstanding prior to settlement. Under this method, the number of units used in calculating diluted EPU is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of units that would be issued upon full physical settlement of the units under any outstanding forward sale agreements for the period prior to settlement over the number of shares of VICI common stock that could be purchased by us in the market (based on the average market price during the period prior to settlement) using the proceeds receivable upon full physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sales price immediately prior to settlement). Upon VICI s physical settlement of the shares of VICI common stock under the outstanding forward sale agreement, the delivery of shares of VICI common stock resulted in an increase in the number of VICI OP Units outstanding and resulting dilution to EPU.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are a Maryland corporation that is primarily engaged in the business of owning and acquiring gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations, subject to long-term triple-net leases. We own 93 experiential assets across a geographically diverse portfolio consisting of 54 gaming properties and 39 other experiential properties across the United States and Canada, including Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort, three of the most iconic entertainment facilities on the Las Vegas Strip. Our properties are occupied by industry-leading gaming, leisure and hospitality operators under long-term, triple-net lease agreements. Across approximately 127 million square feet, our well-maintained properties are curren tly located across urban, destination and drive-to markets in twenty-six states and Canada, contain approximately 60,300 hotel rooms and feature over 500 restaurants, bars, nightclubs and sportsbooks. 
 We also have a growing array of real estate and financing partnerships with leading operators in other experiential sectors, including Bowlero, Cabot, Canyon Ranch, Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf Resorts, Homefield, and Kalahari Resorts. This portfolio includes certain real estate debt investments that we have originated for strategic reasons, primarily in connection with transactions that either do or may provide the potential to convert our investment into the ownership of certain of the underlying real estate in the future. In addition, we own approximately 33 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip that is leased to Caesars, which we may look to monetize as appropriate. As of September 30, 2024 , our properties are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term, including extension options, of approximately 41.0 years. VICI also owns four championship golf courses located near certain of our properties, two of which are in close proximity to the Las Vegas Strip. 
 We believe we have a mutually beneficial relationship with each of our tenants, all of which are leading owners and operators of gaming, entertainment and leisure properties. Our long-term triple-net lease agreements with our tenants provide us with a highly predictable revenue stream with embedded growth potential. We believe our geographic diversification limits the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance. We are focused on driving long-term total returns through managing experiential asset growth and allocating capital diligently, maintaining a highly productive tenant base, and optimizing our capital structure to support external growth. As a growth focused public real estate investment trust with long-term investments, we believe our relationship with our partners will position us for additional investments in our current properties and the acquisition of additional properties across leisure and hospitality over the long-term. 
 Our portfolio is competitively positioned and well-maintained. Pursuant to the terms of our lease agreements, which require our tenants to invest in our properties, and in line with our tenants commitment to build guest loyalty, we anticipate our tenants will continue to make strategic value-enhancing investments in our properties over time, helping to maintain their competitive position. Our long-term triple-net leases provide our tenants with complete control over management at our leased properties, including sole responsibility for all operations and related expenses, including property taxes, insurance and maintenance, repair, improvement and other capital expenditures, as well as over the implementation of environmental sustainability and other initiatives.

Table of Contents 

 We conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We believe VICI s election of REIT status, combined with the income generation from the lease agreements and loans, will enhance our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, providing investors with current income as well as long-term growth, subject to the macroeconomic environment, other global events and market conditions more broadly. We conduct our real property business through VICI OP and our golf course business through a TRS, VICI Golf. 
 The financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is our consolidated results (including the real property business and the golf course business) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Impact of Material Trends on Our Business 
 Recent macroeconomic volatility has introduced significant uncertainty and heightened risk for businesses, including us and our tenants, including the impact of a heightened interest rate environment (and uncertainty regarding future rate changes), inflation and increased cost of capital. Our tenants also face additional challenges, including potential changes in consumer confidence levels, which may impact consumer behavior and spending, and increased operational expenses, such as with respect to labor or energy costs. As a triple-net lessor, increased operational expenses at our leased properties are borne by our tenants and do not directly impact their rent obligations (other than with respect to underlying inflation as applied to the CPI-based escalators) or other obligations under our lease agreements. As a triple-net lessor, we believe we are generally in a strong creditor position and structurally insulated from operational and performance impacts of our tenants, both positive and negative. However, the full extent to which these trends adversely affect our tenants and/or ultimately impact us depends on future developments that cannot be predicted with confidence, including our tenants financial performance, the direct and indirect effects of such trends (including among other things, interest rate changes, inflation, economic recessions, consumer confidence levels and general conditions in the capital and credit markets) and the impact of any future measures taken in response to such trends on our tenants. 
 For more information, refer to the sections entitled Key Trends That May Affect Our Business and Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as updated from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. 
 SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES DURING 2024 
 Acquisition and Leasing Activity 
 Venetian Capital Investment. On May 1, 2024, we entered into agreements to fund up to 700.0 million of capital investment into the Venetian Resort for extensive reinvestment projects through our Partner Property Growth Fund strategy (the Venetian Capital Investment ). The invested capital will earn a return through the addition of incremental rent to the Venetian Lease. The up to 700.0 million of funding through the Venetian Capital Investment is comprised of 400.0 million that has already been funded and an incremental 300.0 million that the Venetian Resort will have the option, but not the obligation, to draw in whole or in part until November 1, 2026. The initial 400.0 million investment was funded based on a fixed schedule: 100.0 million was funded in the second quarter of 2024, 150.0 million was funded in the third quarter of 2024 and 150.0 million was funded on October 1, 2024. The previous Property Growth Fund Agreement entered into with the tenant in connection with the Venetian Resort acquisition providing for up to 1.0 billion of future development and construction project funding was terminated on May 1, 2024 concurrently with the entry into the agreement to fund the Venetian Capital Investment. 
 In connection with the Venetian Capital Investment, annual rent under the Venetian Lease will increase commencing on the first day of the quarter immediately following each capital funding at a 7.25 yield (the Incremental Venetian Rent ). In addition to any increase pursuant to the Incremental Venetian Rent, annual rent under the Venetian Lease will begin escalating annually at 2.0 on March 1, 2029 and, commencing on March 1, 2031, will begin escalating on the same terms as the rest of the rent payable under the Venetian Lease with annual escalation equal to the greater of 2.0 or CPI, capped at 3.0 . On July 1, 2024, the aggregate annual rent under the Venetian Lease increased by 7.3 million as a result of the first 100.0 million funding. Subsequent to quarter-end, on October 1, 2024, the aggregate annual rent under the Venetian Lease increased by 10.9 million as a result of the additional 150.0 million that was funded during the third quarter.

On March 18, 2024, VICI LP issued (i) 550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750 Senior Notes due 2034, which mature on April 1, 2034 and (ii) 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.125 Senior Notes due 2054, which mature on April 1, 2054, in each case under a supplemental indenture dated as of March 18, 2024, between VICI LP and the Trustee. We used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem (i) 1,024.2 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625 Senior Notes due May 1, 2024 and (ii) 25.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625 Senior Notes due May 1, 2024. 
 Forward-Starting Interest Rate Swaps. On March 11, 2024, we settled the seven outstanding forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 500.0 million resulting in net proceeds of 2.8 million. Since the forward-starting swaps were hedging the interest rate risk on the March 2024 Notes, the unrealized gain in Accumulated other comprehensive income is being amortized over the term of the respective derivative instruments, which matches that of the underlying note, as a decrease in interest expense. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we entered into eight forward-starting interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of 400.0 million to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates from the trade date through the forecasted issuance of senior unsecured notes expected to be issued in connection with the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes maturing in 2025.

 (1) Represents our asset acquisitions structured as sale leaseback transactions. In accordance with ASC 842, since the lease agreements were determined to meet the definition of a sales-type lease and control of the asset is not considered to have transferred to us, such lease agreements are accounted for as financings under ASC 310. 
 (2) Amounts represent the non-cash adjustment to income from sales-type leases and lease financing receivables in order to recognize income on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the term of the leases. 
 Leasing revenue is generated from rent from our lease agreements. Total leasing revenue increased 42.6 million and 145.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Total contractual leasing revenue increased 38.0 million and 125.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases were primarily driven by the acquisition of the remaining 49.9 of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay portfolio in January 2023, the Rocky Gap Casino component of the master lease agreement with Century Casinos, Inc. Century Master Lease in July 2023, the Canadian portfolio component of the Century Master Lease in September 2023, the master lease agreement with Bowlero in October 2023, the lease agreement with Chelsea Piers in December 2023 and the incremental rent increase from the Venetian Capital Investment in July 2024, as well as the annual rent escalators from certain of our other lease agreements. 
 Income From Loans and Securities 
 Income from loans and securities increased 16.5 million and 44.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases were driven by the origination and subsequent funding, as applicable, of our debt investments and the related interest income from the increased principal balances outstanding under such debt investments, partially offset by the full repayment of certain loan investments. 
 Other Income 
 Other income increased 1.1 million and 2.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by the additional income as a result of the assumption of certain sub-leases in connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Rocky Gap Casino in July 2023 and the sale-leaseback transaction with Chelsea Piers in December 2023. We determined 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 that we are the primary obligor of the respective ground and use leases and, accordingly, record the related income and expense on a gross basis on our Income Statement. The lease agreements require our tenants to cover all costs associated with such ground and use sub-leases and provide for their direct payment to the primary landlord. 
 Operating Expenses 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses were comprised of the following items: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance General and administrative 16,458 14,422 2,036 48,418 44,347 4,071 Depreciation 1,008 1,011 (3) 3,133 2,712 421 Other expenses 19,315 18,179 1,136 57,950 55,043 2,907 Golf expenses 6,824 6,332 492 20,148 18,874 1,274 Change in allowance for credit losses (31,626) 95,997 (127,623) 32,292 166,119 (133,827) Transaction and acquisition expenses 1,164 3,566 (2,402) 1,728 3,385 (1,657) Total operating expenses 13,143 139,507 (126,364) 163,669 290,480 (126,811) 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased 2.0 million and 4.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation, including stock-based compensation and the addition of new employees. 
 Other Expenses 
 Other expenses increased 1.1 million and 2.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by the additional expense as a result of the assumption of certain sub-leases in connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Rocky Gap Casino in July 2023 and the sale-leaseback transaction with Chelsea Piers in December 2023. We determined we are the primary obligor of the respective ground and use leases and, accordingly, record the related income and expense on a gross basis on our Income Statement. The lease agreements require our tenants to cover all costs associated with such ground and use sub-leases and provide for their direct payment to the primary landlord. 
 Change in Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Change in allowance for credit losses decreased 127.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by positive changes in the macroeconomic forecast during the current quarter and market performance of our tenants partially offset by certain adjustments made to the assumptions used to project future cash flows for one of our investments. 
 Change in allowance for credit losses decreased 133.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower initial CECL allowances recorded on our acquisition and loan origination activity. We recorded initial CECL allowances of 2.9 million on our 365.0 million of loan origination activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to initial CECL allowances of 263.6 million on our 6.1 billion of property acquisition activity and 8.0 million on our 375.1 million of loan origination activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by certain adjustments made to the assumptions used to project future cash flows for one of our investments. 
 Further fluctuation in the change in allowance for credit losses are the result of changes to the reasonable and supportable period, or R S Period, probability of default, or PD, and loss given default, or LGD, of our existing tenants and their parent guarantors (as applicable) as a result of market performance and changes in the macroeconomic model used to scenario condition such inputs and annual standard updates to the model used to estimate the CECL allowance. Refer to Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses for further details.

 Transaction and Acquisition Expenses 
 Transaction and acquisition expenses decreased 2.4 million and 1.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in transaction and acquisition expenses are related to fluctuations in (i) costs incurred for investments during the period that are not capitalizable under GAAP, and (ii) costs incurred for investments that we are no longer pursuing. 
 Non-Operating Income and Expenses 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our non-operating income and expenses were comprised of the following items: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance Income from unconsolidated affiliate 1,280 (1,280) Interest expense (207,317) (204,927) (2,390) (617,976) (612,881) (5,095) Interest income 2,797 7,341 (4,544) 12,016 16,194 (4,178) Other (losses) gains (64) (1,122) 1,058 770 4,295 (3,525) 
 Income from Unconsolidated Affiliate 
 Income from unconsolidated affiliate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents our 50.1 share of the income of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV for the period from January 1, 2023 through January 8, 2023, immediately prior to the closing of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition. Beginning on January 9, 2023, upon the closing of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition, we consolidated the operations of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV, and subsequently, such income is included in Income from sales-type lease on our Statement of Operations and, accordingly, no Income from unconsolidated affiliate was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 2.4 million and 5.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily related to the increase in debt from the (i) C 140.0 million, C 75.0 million and 14.5 million draws on the Revolving Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of the portfolio of assets leased to PURE Canadian Gaming, Corp. in January 2023, the acquisition of the Canadian portfolio component of the Century Master Lease in September 2023 and the Cabot Highlands loan in December 2023, respectively, partially offset by a C 15.0 million principal repayment under the Revolving Credit Facility in August 2024 and (ii) assumption of 3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of CMBS debt on January 9, 2023, in connection with the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition, the combination of which resulted in an additional 3.2 billion in notional amount of debt. 
 Additionally, the weighted average annualized interest rate of our debt, net of the impact of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, increased to 4.34 from 4.32 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of a higher effective interest rate on (i) the draws on the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) the March 2024 Notes as compared to the debt that was refinanced by such notes. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income, representing interest earned on our excess cash, decreased 4.5 million and 4.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by an overall decrease in our cash on hand throughout the current periods as compared to the prior periods. 
 Other (Losses) Gains 
 Other (losses) decreased 1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and Other gains decreased 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes primarily relate to foreign currency remeasurement adjustments associated with our investments in Canada and the United Kingdom. In connection with such transactions, we entered into 
 52

 foreign denominated debt on the Revolving Credit Facility, of which C 200.0 million and 14.5 million is currently outstanding and, since such debt is held at entities with USD as their functional currency, certain of the related assets and liabilities are remeasured through the Statement of Operations. 
 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 We present VICI s Funds From Operations FFO ), FFO per share, Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO ), AFFO per share, and Adjusted EBITDA, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). These are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP). We believe FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of VICI s business. 
 FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. Consistent with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), we define FFO as VICI s net income (or loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, (ii) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) our proportionate share of such adjustments from our investment in unconsolidated affiliate. 
 AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate VICI s performance. We calculate VICI s AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO non-cash leasing and financing adjustments, non-cash change in allowance for credit losses, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments, amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, other non-cash interest expense, non-real estate depreciation (which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations), capital expenditures (which are comprised of additions to property, plant and equipment related to our golf course operations), impairment charges related to non-depreciable real estate, gains (or losses) on debt extinguishment and interest rate swap settlements, other (losses) gains, deferred income tax benefits and expenses, other non-recurring non-cash transactions, our proportionate share of non-cash adjustments from our investment in unconsolidated affiliate (including the amortization of any basis differences) with respect to certain of the foregoing and non-cash adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest with respect to certain of the foregoing. 
 We calculate VICI s Adjusted EBITDA by adding or subtracting from AFFO contractual interest expense (including the impact of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks) and interest income (collectively, interest expense, net), income tax expense and our proportionate share of such adjustments from our investment in unconsolidated affiliate. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures: (i) do not represent VICI s cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to VICI s net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to VICI s cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In addition, these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity, nor do they measure our ability to fund all of our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders, to fund capital improvements, or to make interest payments on our indebtedness. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies, including REITs, due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of VICI s financial results in accordance with GAAP.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our available cash and cash-equivalents balance, short-term investments, capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds available from outstanding forward sale agreements were as follows: 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 355,667 Capacity under Revolving Credit Facility (1) 
 2,332,296 Net proceeds available from settlement of Forward Sale Agreements (2) 
 630,222 Total 3,318,185 
 ____________________ 
 (1) In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility includes the option to increase the revolving loan commitments by up to 1.0 billion to the extent that any one or more lenders (from the syndicate or otherwise) agree to provide such additional extensions of credit. 
 (2) Assumes the physical settlement of the 20,853,338 shares remaining to be settled as of September 30, 2024 under our ATM forward sale agreements at a forward sales price of 30.22, calculated as of September 30, 2024. Subsequent to quarter-end, on October 1, 2024, we physically settled 7,000,000 shares under an ATM forward sale agreement in exchange for total net settlement proceeds of approximately 200.9 million. 
 We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our material cash requirements, including our contractual obligations, debt maturities and commitments as well as our additional funding requirements, primarily through currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash received under our lease agreements, existing borrowings from banks, including our undrawn capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, net proceeds available under our outstanding forward sale agreements, and proceeds from future issuances of debt and equity securities (including issuances under the ATM Program) for the next 12 months and in future periods. 
 All of our lease agreements call for an initial term of between fifteen and thirty-two years with additional tenant renewal options and, along with our loans, are designed to provide us with a reliable and predictable long-term revenue stream. Our cash flows from operations and our ability to access capital resources could be adversely affected due to uncertain economic factors and volatility in the financial and credit markets, including as a result of the current interest rate environment, inflationary pressures, equity market volatility, and changes in consumer behavior and spending. In particular, we can provide no assurances that our tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses become challenged due to, among other things, current or future adverse economic conditions. See Overview Impact of Material Trends on our Business above for additional detail. In the event our tenants are unable to make all of their contractual rent payments as provided by our lease agreements, we believe we have sufficient liquidity from the other sources discussed above to meet all of our contractual obligations for a significant period of time. For more information, refer to the risk factors incorporated by reference into Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors herein from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 Our ability to raise funds in the future through the issuance of debt and equity securities and access to other third-party sources of capital on attractive terms, or at all, will be dependent on, among other things, general economic conditions, general market conditions for REITs and investment grade issuers, market perceptions, the trading price of our stock and uncertainties related to the macroeconomic environment. We will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time, but financing through the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms we deem attractive, or at all. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our short-term obligations consist primarily of regular interest payments on our debt obligations, dividends to our common stockholders, distributions to the VICI OP Unit holders and Bowlero OP Unit holders, normal recurring operating expenses, recurring expenditures for corporate and administrative needs, certain lease and other contractual commitments related to our golf operations and certain non-recurring expenditures.

 Distribution Policy 
 We intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of our common stock. Dividends declared (on a per share basis) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Period Dividend March 7, 2024 March 21, 2024 April 4, 2024 January 1, 2024 - March 31, 2024 0.4150 June 7, 2024 June 18, 2024 July 3, 2024 April 1, 2024 - June 30, 2024 0.4150 September 5, 2024 September 18, 2024 October 3, 2024 July 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 0.4325 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Period Dividend March 9, 2023 March 23, 2023 April 6, 2023 January 1, 2023 - March 31, 2023 0.3900 June 8, 2023 June 22, 2023 July 6, 2023 April 1, 2023 - June 30, 2023 0.3900 September 7, 2023 September 21, 2023 October 5, 2023 July 1, 2023 - September 30, 2023 0.4150 
 Federal income tax law requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income (with certain adjustments), determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains. In addition, a REIT will be required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income, 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years. 
 We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal income or excise tax (other than at any TRS of ours). We may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, we may generate REIT taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of REIT taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . There have been no significant changes in our critical policies and estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows. To achieve this objective, our consolidated subsidiaries primarily borrow on a fixed-rate basis for longer-term debt issuances. As of September 30, 2024, we had 17.1 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, of which 99.0 has fixed rate interest and 1.0 has a variable interest rate, representing the US 167.7 million outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility (denominated in CAD and GBP and based on the applicable exchange rate as of September 30, 2024). As of September 30, 2024, a one percent increase or decrease in the annual interest rate on our variable rate borrowings would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately 1.7 million using the applicable exchange rate as of September 30, 2024. 
 Additionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk between the time we enter into a transaction and the time we finance the related transaction with long-term fixed-rate debt. In addition, when that long-term debt matures, we may have to refinance such debt at a higher interest rate. In a heightened interest rate environment, we have from time to time and may in the future seek to mitigate that risk by utilizing forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, treasury locks and other derivative instruments. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control.

 Capital Markets Risks 
 We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets and our related ability to finance our business through long-term indebtedness, borrowings under credit facilities or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of capital we raise.
