Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of financial instruments. Inputs may be based on independent market data observable inputs or they may be internally developed unobservable inputs ). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level 2 
 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and 

Level 3 
 Unobservable inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trust s assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments. 

Fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Trust s net asset value and the prices used by the Trust s underlying index, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust s performance and the performance of the Trust s underlying index. 
 
 The following table summarizes the value of each of the Trust s investments by the fair value hierarchy levels as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 Q. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, should, could, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by the Sponsor on the basis of its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed below, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Although the Sponsor does not make forward looking statements unless it believes it has a reasonable basis for doing so, the Sponsor cannot guarantee their accuracy. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws, none of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Advisor, the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee is under a duty to update any of the forward looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in expectations or predictions. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 The iShares S P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (the Trust is a Delaware statutory trust that issues units of beneficial interest Shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The Trust holds long positions in exchange-traded index futures contracts of various expirations, Index Futures on the S P GSCI Excess Return Index (the S P GSCI-ER ), together with cash, U.S. Treasury securities or other short-term securities and similar securities that are eligible as margin deposits for the Trust s Index Futures positions, referred to as Collateral Assets. The Index Futures held by the Trust are listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the CME ). The Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the S P GSCI Total Return Index (the Index before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities. 
 
 iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor ). BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. is the Trustee of the Trust. The Trust is a commodity pool, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), and is operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. BlackRock Fund Advisors (the Advisor ), an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., serves as the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust has delegated day-to-day administration of the Trust to the Trustee. The Trustee has delegated certain day-to-day administrative functions of the Trustee to State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Trust Administrator ). Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware trust company, serves as the Delaware Trustee of the Trust. 
 
 The Trust intends to offer Shares on a continuous basis. The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares Baskets ). Only institutions that enter into an agreement with the Trust to become Authorized Participants may purchase or redeem Baskets, in exchange for Index Futures and Collateral Assets with an aggregate value equal to the net asset value per Share, or NAV of the Shares being purchased or redeemed. 
 
 Owners of beneficial interests in Shares Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants have no right to redeem their Shares. In order to liquidate their investment in the Shares, Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants must generally sell their Shares in the secondary market, assuming that demand for their Shares exists. The price obtained by the Shareholders for the Shares may be less than the NAV of those Shares. 
 
 Shares of the Trust trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol GSG. 
 
 Valuation of Index Futures Computation of the Trust s Net Asset Value 
 
 The Sponsor has the exclusive authority to determine the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV, which it has delegated to the Trustee under the Fourth Amended and Restated Trust Agreement. The Trustee determines the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV as of 4:00 p.m. (New York time), on each Business Day on which NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as soon as practicable after that time. A Business Day is a day (1) on which none of the following occurs: (a) NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading, (b) the Exchange is closed for regular trading or (c) the Federal Reserve wire transfer system is closed for cash wire transfers, or (2) that the Trustee determines that it is able to conduct business. 
 
 The Trustee values the Trust s long positions in Index Futures on the basis of that day s settlement prices for the Index Futures held by the Trust as announced by the applicable Exchange. The value of the Trust s positions in any particular Index Futures contract equals the product of (1) the number of such Index Futures contracts owned by the Trust, (2) the settlement price of such Index Futures contract on the date of calculation and (3) the multiplier of such Index Futures contract. If there is no announced settlement price for a particular Index Futures contract on a Business Day, the Trustee uses the most recently announced settlement price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation. The daily settlement price for each Index Futures contract currently held by the Trust is established on each trading day, generally at 2:40 p.m. (New York time), by the CME Group Inc., and its designed contract markets, including the CME, CBOT (Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc.), NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange), COMEX and KCBT (the CME Group staff. 
 
 The Trustee values all other holdings of the Trust at (1) its current market value, if quotations for such property are readily available or (2) its fair value, as reasonably determined by the Trustee, if the current market value cannot be determined. 
 
 Once the value of the Index Futures, Collateral Assets of the Trust and interest earned on the Trust s Collateral Assets has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust as of the time of calculation in order to calculate the net asset value of the Trust.

Table of Contents 

Once the net asset value of the Trust has been calculated, the Trustee determines the NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made. Any changes to the NAV that may result from creation and redemption activity are not reflected in the NAV calculations for purposes of the Trust s operations until the Business Day following the Business Day on which they occur, but are reflected in the Trust s financial statements as of such first Business Day. Creation and redemption orders received after 2:40 p.m. (New York time) are not deemed to be received, and the related creation or redemption will not be deemed to occur, until the following Business Day. Subject to the approval of the Trustee, Baskets may be created solely for cash, but the related creation orders will be deemed received as of the following Business Day unless received by 10:00 a.m. (New York time). Orders are expected to settle by 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day following the Business Day on which such orders are deemed to be received. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 The Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 The Trust s net asset value decreased from 1,098,519,705 at June 30, 2024 to 881,380,256 at September 30, 2024. The decrease in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from a net decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 49,500,000 Shares at June 30, 2024 to 42,000,000 Shares at September 30, 2024, a consequence of 350,000 Shares (7 Baskets) being created and 7,850,000 Shares (157 Baskets) being redeemed during the quarter. The Trust s net asset value was also affected by a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations. 
 
 The 5.41 decrease in the NAV from 22.19 at June 30, 2024 to 20.99 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 6.51 decrease in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The NAV decreased slightly less than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the interest income from U.S. Treasury bills. 
 
 The net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 59,879,999, resulting from a net realized and unrealized loss of 70,955,953, partially offset by a net investment income of 11,075,954. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized loss of 70,477 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of 70,885,476 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor s fees of 1,801,762 and brokerage commissions and fees of 159,320, the Trust had no expenses during the quarter. 
 
 The Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 The Trust s net asset value decreased from 968,051,679 at December 31, 2023 to 881,380,256 at September 30, 2024. The decrease in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from a net decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 48,200,000 Shares at December 31, 2023 to 42,000,000 Shares at September 30, 2024, a consequence of 8,100,000 Shares (162 Baskets) being created and 14,300,000 Shares (286 Baskets) being redeemed during the period. The decrease in the Trust s net asset value was partially offset by a net increase in net assets resulting from operations. 
 
 The 4.53 increase in the NAV from 20.08 at December 31, 2023 to 20.99 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 1.12 increase in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The NAV increased more than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the interest income from U.S. Treasury bills. 
 
 The net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36,958,771, resulting from a net realized and unrealized gain of 2,954,190, and a net investment income of 34,004,581. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized loss of 169,987 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized gain of 3,124,177 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor s fees of 5,612,921 and brokerage commissions and fees of 581,121, the Trust had no expenses during the period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Trust s assets as of September 30, 2024 consist of Index Futures and Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. The Trust does not anticipate any further need for liquidity, because creations and redemptions of Shares generally occur in-kind and ordinary expenses are met by cash on hand. Interest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the Trust and is used to pay the Sponsor s fees and purchase additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets, or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to Shareholders. In exchange for a fee based on the net asset value of the Trust, the Sponsor has assumed most of the ordinary expenses incurred by the Trust. In the case of an extraordinary expense and/or insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses, however, the Trust could be forced to liquidate its positions in Index Futures and Collateral Assets to pay such expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the market for Index Futures had not developed significant liquidity and the Trust represented substantially all of the long-side open interest in Index Futures. In addition, it is expected that Goldman Sachs Co. LLC or its accountholders may represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side interest in such market. The existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate losses to the Trust if the Trust were required to liquidate its Index Futures positions. 
 
 The Sponsor is unaware of any other trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to the Trust s liquidity needs. 
 
 Because the Trust trades Index Futures, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of the Index Futures or other assets (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform (credit risk). 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 The Trust holds Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Futures positions. Because of this limited diversification of the Trust s assets, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares. The value of the Index Futures is expected to track generally the S P GSCI-ER, although this correlation may not be exact. The S P GSCI-ER, in turn, reflects the value of a diversified group of commodities. The Trust s exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Futures market and activities of other market participants. 

15

Table of Contents 

Credit Risk 
 
 When the Trust purchases or holds Index Futures, it is exposed to the credit risk of a default by the CME s clearing house, which serves as the counterparty to each Index Futures position, and of a default by its futures commission merchant, or Clearing FCM. In the case of such a default, the Trust may be unable to recover amounts due to it on its Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets posted as margin. The Trust is also exposed to credit risk as a result of its ownership of U.S. Treasury bills or of perceived or actual economic distress or failures of financial institutions. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 
 The Trust does not use and is not expected to use special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Trust does not have and is not expected to have loan guarantee arrangements or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services that are in the interest of the Trust. While the Trust s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Trust s financial position. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements of the Trust for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Quantitative Disclosure 
 
 The Trust is exposed to commodity price risk through the Trust s holdings of Index Futures. The following table provides information about the Trust s futures contract positions, which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. As of September 30, 2024, the Trust s open Index Futures positions (long) were as follows: 

Number of contracts: 

30,550 

Expiration date: 
 
 December 2024 

Weighted-average price per contract: 

277.04 

Notional amount (fair value): 

878,883,785 

The notional amount is calculated using the settlement price for the Index Futures on the CME on September 30, 2024, which was 287.69 per contract, and the 100 multiplier applicable under the contract terms. 
 
 The Trust has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term U.S. Treasury bills and such market risk is expected to be immaterial. 
 
 Qualitative Disclosure 
 
 As described herein, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Index itself is intended to reflect the performance of a diversified group of physical commodities, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. The Trust obtains this exposure to commodity prices through the Trust s Index Futures positions. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Trust s Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares. 
 
 The Trust will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the S P GSCI ER, or the value of any Collateral Assets. The Trust s exposure to market risk may be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Futures market and activities of other market participants. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
 
 There were no changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.

 None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors last reported under Part I, Item 1A of the registrant s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2024: 
 
 The market values of the investments by the Trust may be negatively impacted by changes in interest rates, and, as a result, the value or liquidity of the cash equivalents and marketable securities of the Trust could decline, which could adversely affect the performance of the Trust. 
 
 The Trust will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury securities and thus is subject to interest rate risk, which refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security or other instrument due to changes in the general level of interest rates. An increase in interest rates generally will cause the value of fixed-income securities to decline. Securities with longer maturities generally are more sensitive to interest rate changes and subject to greater fluctuations in value. Changes in interest rates may have unpredictable effects on fixed-income markets and result in heightened market volatility and lower liquidity for certain instruments, all of which may adversely affect the Trust s performance. Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable and are influenced by a number of factors, including government policy, monetary policy, inflation expectations, perceptions of risk, and supply and demand for fixed-income securities. 
 
 A failure of Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, the clearing futures commission merchant (the Clearing FCM to segregate assets or a default of the Clearing FCM, its customers or other market participants may cause losses for the Trust. 
 
 The Commodity Exchange Act requires clearing futures commission merchants FCMs to segregate all funds received from customers from such clearing FCM s proprietary assets. If the Clearing FCM fails to segregate customer assets as required, the assets of the Trust might not be fully protected in the event of the Clearing FCM s distress, impairment or bankruptcy. Furthermore, in the event of the Clearing FCM s distress, impairment or bankruptcy, the Trust could be delayed in recovering its assets. The Trust also could be limited to recovering its pro rata share of all available customer funds held by the Clearing FCM, or the Trust may not recover any assets at all, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Trust was held by the Clearing FCM. 
 
 In addition, the Commodity Exchange Act requires an approved derivatives clearing organization to segregate all funds and other property received from an FCM on behalf of the FCM s customers in connection with U.S. futures and options contracts from any funds held at the clearing organization to support the FCM s proprietary trading. Nevertheless, customer funds held at a clearing organization in connection with futures or options contracts may be held in a commingled omnibus account, which may not identify the names of the FCM s individual customers. With respect to futures and options contracts, a clearing organization may use the assets of a non-defaulting customer held in an omnibus account at the clearing organization to satisfy the payment obligations of a defaulting customer of the FCM to the clearing organization. In the event of a default of another client of the Clearing FCM or the Clearing FCM s failure to extend its own funds in connection with any such default, the Trust may not be able to recover the full amount of assets deposited by the Clearing FCM with the clearing organization on the Trust s behalf. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of any exchange or clearing house, the Trust could experience a loss of the funds deposited through the Clearing FCM as margin with the exchange or clearing house, a loss of any unrealized profits on its open positions on the exchange, and the loss of unrealized profits on its closed positions on the exchange.
