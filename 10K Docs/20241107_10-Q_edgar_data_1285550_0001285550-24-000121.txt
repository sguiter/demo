SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements relate to our expectations for performance, revenues and costs, and the adequacy of cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments to support operations and meet future obligations. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "anticipates," "believes," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "potential," "predicts," "projects," "should," "will," "would," and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain. 
 In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should refer to (i) the section titled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which we filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 12, 2024 (the "2023 Form 10-K"), (ii) Item 2 of this Quarterly Report, under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations" and (iii) Part II, Item 1.A of this Quarterly Report. As a result of these risk factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. We do not undertake to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.

As discussed in Note 7, the Company entered into a lease for a manufacturing facility in Carlsbad, California, which commenced in June 2023.

biologics and drug delivery customers who are evaluating or using its products and services in trials to inject gene and cell therapies directly into the brain. These relationships involve drug development programs that are at various stages of development ranging from preclinical research to late-stage regulatory trials for multiple distinct disease states. This part of the Company s business potentially represents the largest opportunity for growth; however, the Company s ability to grow in this market is dependent on its ability to maintain and establish new relationships with customers, such customers' continuation of research and product development plans, and such customers' achievement of success in completion of clinical trials and subsequent regulatory approvals of their biologics and drugs. 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 The Company continues to monitor the impact of various macroeconomic trends, such as global economic and supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including instability resulting from military conflicts), labor shortages, inflationary conditions, and legislative and political developments. Impacts from inflationary pressures, such as increasing costs for research and development of the Company's products, administrative and other costs of doing business, and the Company's access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the future could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these trends could adversely affect the Company's customers, which could impact their willingness to spend on the Company's products and services, or their ability to make payment, which could harm the Company's collection of accounts receivable and financial results. The continued development and fluidity of these situations preclude any prediction as to the ultimate impact they will have on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows . 
 Liquidity 
 The Company has incurred net losses since its inception, which has resulted in a cumulative deficit at September 30, 2024 of million. In addition, the Company s use of cash from operations amounted to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since its inception, the Company has financed its operations principally from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of notes payable, however, there is no assurance a future sale of equity securities and/or issuance of notes payable will be at terms favorable to the Company or available at all. As required by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., the Company has evaluated its ability to continue as a going concern and has determined that based on current forecasts, existing cash and cash equivalent balances at September 30, 2024 are sufficient to support the Company's operations and meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months. 
 In March 2024, the Company completed a public offering of shares of its common stock from which the net proceeds totaled approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses paid by the Company. See Note 8 below for additional information with respect to the common stock offering.

 million outstanding under a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into in 2020 (the "SPA"), pursuant to which the Company issued secured convertible notes to investors raising gross proceeds of million, of which million had been previously converted to common stock.

, or as commercial sales occur that are related to the royalty prepayment. In addition, the Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its investment in the license rights and records an impairment charge in the event such evaluation indicates that the Company s investment is not likely to be recovered.

 and is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the service agreement. A time-elapsed output method is used for service revenue because the Company transfers control evenly by providing a stand-ready service. 
 The Company may also enter into contracts with customers who own ClearPoint capital equipment, which bundle maintenance and support services and access to software and hardware upgrades made commercially available over the term of the contract, for a single contract price, typically paid on an annual basis. The Company allocates the contract price among the performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone prices for each such performance obligation and recognizes the revenue ratably on a monthly basis. A time-elapsed output method is used as the Company is providing a stand-ready service for each of the performance obligations. 
 Installation, training and shipping: Consistent with the Company s recognition of revenue for capital equipment and software sales as described above, fees for installation, training and shipping in connection with sales of capital equipment and software that have been preceded by customer evaluation periods are recognized as revenue at the point in time the Company is in receipt of an executed purchase agreement or purchase order for the equipment and software. Installation, training and shipping fees related to capital equipment and software sales not having been preceded by an evaluation period are recognized as revenue concurrent with the recognition of revenue from sales of the related capital equipment.

 industry segment, and the predominance of its sales are to U.S.-based customers. 
 Payment terms under contracts with customers generally are in a range of - days after the customers receipt of the Company s invoices. 
 The Company s terms and conditions do not provide for a right of return unless for: (a) product defects; or (b) other conditions subject to the Company s approval. 
 See Note 3 for additional information regarding revenue recognition. 
 million in bank balances that were in excess of the insured limits. 
 At September 30, 2024, there was one customer whose accounts receivable balance represented of accounts receivable at that date. At December 31, 2023, there were four customers whose accounts receivable balances represented of accounts receivable at that date. 
 One pharmaceutical customer, a related party who is a stockholder and whose chief executive officer is a member of the Company's Board of Directors, for whom the Company provides hardware, software, clinical services and market development services in support of the customer's clinical trials, and from whom the Company earns a quarterly fee, accounted for and of total sales in both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There was one additional customer, who comprised of the total sales in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and another customer who comprised of the total sales in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Prior to granting credit to a customer, the Company generally performs credit evaluations of the customer's financial condition. In general, the Company does not require collateral from customers in connection with an extension of credit. The accounts receivable balance is reduced by an allowance for credit losses from the potential inability of the Company's customers to make required payments. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was million and million, respectively. The Company evaluates the historic loss experience on the accounts receivable balance and also considers separately customers with receivable balances that may be negatively impacted by current economic developments and market conditions. The estimate is a result of the Company's ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses and future expectations. 
 The Company is subject to risks common to emerging companies in the medical device industry, including, but not limited to: new technological innovations; acceptance and competitiveness of its products; dependence on key personnel; dependence on key suppliers; its ability to maintain its third-party collaboration, license and joint development partners, and enter into new relationships; changes in general economic conditions and interest rates; its

 Contract Balances 
 Contract assets The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to the Company's customers. In most cases, customers are billed upon shipment of such products or delivery of such services and the related contract assets, which represent an unconditional right to consideration, comprise the accounts receivable balance. When revenue is recognized in advance of its right to bill and receive consideration, the Company records this unbilled receivable as a contract asset, which is classified as other current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Other contract assets Unbilled receivables 
 Contract liabilities Contract liabilities consist of amounts that have been invoiced and for which the Company has the right to bill, but that have not been recognized as revenue as the related goods or services have not been transferred. The Company's contract liabilities are generally comprised of the following: (1) capital equipment and software-related service fees that are typically billed and collected at the inception of the service agreements, which have terms ranging from one to ; (2) annual fees for agreements with customers that bundle the capital equipment and software-related service fees with software and hardware upgrades that are made commercially available over the term of the contract; and (3) up-front payments from customers made in connection with consulting services. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million and million of revenue, respectively, which was previously included in deferred revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. 
 Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. The majority of the remaining performance obligations relate to capital equipment and software-related service agreements and the upfront

 investors (the "2020 Convertible Noteholders"), whereby the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of million of secured convertible notes (the "First Closing Notes") pursuant to the SPA, which, unless earlier converted or redeemed, were to mature on January 29, 2025, and bore interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) the three (3)-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and (b) two percent ), plus (ii) a margin of on the outstanding balance of the First Closing Notes, payable quarterly on the first business day of each calendar quarter. The First Closing Notes were convertible at a price of per share, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the SPA and the note agreement, and could not be pre-paid without the consent of the noteholder. In May 2021, one of the 2020 Convertible Noteholders (the "Converting Noteholder") converted the entire million principal amount of such Converting Noteholder s First Closing Note, and related accrued interest of approximately million, into shares of the Company s common stock. 
 In December 2020, the Company issued the Second Closing Note (as defined in the SPA) to one of the 2020 Convertible Noteholders in an aggregate principal amount of million. In November 2021, the holder of the Second Closing Note converted the entire million principal amount of such note, along with related accrued and payment in-kind interest aggregating million, into shares of the Company's common stock. 
 On August 23, 2024, the Company repaid all amounts owing under the remaining First Closing Note, which included the principal amount of million, and related accrued interest of million. In connection with the prepayment, the noteholder waived all prohibitions on prepayment of the note, and all collateral securing the note was released.

period, at the Company s option, provided that the Company s landlord has entered into an extension of its prime lease for the office space that encompasses the Company s office space for at least . 
 The Company leases space in Carlsbad, California, that serves as office space and a manufacturing facility under a lease that commenced on June 1, 2023 and ends on May 31, 2033.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties. You should review the section titled "Risk Factors" appearing in the 2023 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1.A of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis. In addition, historical results and trends that might appear in this Quarterly Report should not be interpreted as being indicative of future operations. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and commercializes innovative platforms for performing minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain. We have deployed significant resources to fund our efforts to develop the capabilities for enabling neurosurgery interventions, building an intellectual property portfolio, and identifying and building out commercial applications for the technologies developed by our company. 
 The foundational part of our business is providing medical devices for neurosurgery applications. Our primary medical device product, the ClearPoint system, is an integrated system comprised of hardware components, disposable components, and intuitive, menu-driven software, which is in commercial use globally. The primary applications for the ClearPoint system are to target and guide the insertion of deep brain stimulation electrodes, biopsy needles, and laser catheters, as well as the delivery of pharmaceuticals into the brain. The ClearPoint system was originally designed for use in an MRI setting. In 2021, we launched the SmartFrame Array Neuro Navigation System and Software, which allow for operating room placement of the ClearPoint system, and in 2024, we released the SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System, which allows for complete procedures to be performed in the operating room. In 2022, we commercialized the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System as our first therapy product offering. We have exclusive global commercialization rights to the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System through our Swedish partner, CLS. 
 The second part of our business is focused on partnerships in the biologics and drug delivery space. Our services include protocol consultation and solutions for preclinical study design and execution for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents to the brain. We also partner with customers to develop devices used for administration of therapies into the central nervous system. Currently, we have more than 50 biologics and drug delivery customers who are evaluating or using our products and services in trials to inject gene and cell therapies directly into the brain. These partnerships involve drug development programs that are at various stages of development ranging from preclinical research to late-stage regulatory trials for multiple distinct disease states. This part of our business potentially represents the largest opportunity for growth; however, our ability to grow in this market is dependent on our ability to maintain and establish new relationships with customers, such customers' continuation of research and development plans, and such customers' achievement of success in completion of clinical trials and subsequent regulatory approvals of their biologics and drugs. 
 Substantially all our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relates to (i) sales of our ClearPoint system products and related services and (ii) providing services to our customers in the biologics and drug delivery space. We have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through the sale of equity securities and the issuance of notes payable. We have incurred significant losses since our inception in 1998 as we have devoted substantial efforts to research and development. As of September 30, 2024, we had accumulated losses of 186.0 million. We may continue to incur operating losses as we expand our ClearPoint system platform, services to our pharmaceutical and other medical technology customers, and our business generally. 
 
 Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations 
 The following is a description of factors that may influence our future results of operations, and that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations. 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 We continue to monitor the impact of various macroeconomic trends, such as global economic and supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including instability resulting from military conflicts), labor shortages, inflationary 
 19 

conditions, and legislative and political developments. Impacts from inflationary pressures, such as increasing costs for research and development of our products, administrative and other costs of doing business, and our access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these trends could adversely affect our customers, which could impact their willingness to spend on our products and services, or their ability to make payment, which could harm the Company's collection of accounts receivable and financial results. The continued development and fluidity of these situations precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact they will have on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
 Revenue 
 In 2010, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") to market our ClearPoint system in the U.S. for general neurosurgical procedures; in February 2011 and May 2018, we also obtained CE marking for our ClearPoint system and SmartFlow cannula, respectively; and in June 2020, we obtained CE marking for version 2.0 of our ClearPoint software and our Inflexion head fixation frame. In January 2021, we received 510(k) clearance for the SmartFrame Array Neuro Navigation System. In September 2022, the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System, for which we have exclusive global rights to commercialize, received 510(k) clearance through our Swedish partner, CLS. The Prism laser represents the first therapy product we have commercialized. In January 2024, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System. 
 In 2021, we started providing services to our pharmaceutical and other medical technology customers for improving outcome predictability and optimizing preclinical and clinical workflows. Our expertise is concentrated in benchtop testing, preclinical studies, clinical trial support, regulatory consultation, and over-arching translation from the preclinical to the clinical setting to enhance accuracy and precision of drug delivery. In 2024, we expanded our services to our pharmaceutical and other medical technology customers to include development of devices used for administration of therapies into the central nervous system. 
 Future revenue from sales of products and services is difficult to predict and may not be sufficient to offset our continuing research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Generating recurring revenue from the sale of products is an important part of our business model for our ClearPoint system. Our product revenue was approximately 5.5 million and 14.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Our service and other revenue was approximately 2.6 million and 9.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, of which 89 and 92 , respectively, is related to the biologics and drug delivery service line. 
 Our revenue recognition policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included above in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report. 
 Underlying the revenue from sales of products and services to our biologics and drug delivery customers is the number of direct customers and end users of our products and/or services ("Partners"). Our Partners consist of pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic institutions, and customer-sponsored contract research organizations that are developing methods to deliver a wide variety of molecules, genes or proteins to targeted brain tissue or structures that would need to bypass the blood-brain barrier for the treatment of a variety of disorders. This is a novel area in which commercialization must be preceded by FDA-mandated clinical trials, which are expensive and time consuming to conduct, and for which the commercial success is uncertain, pending, in part, the outcome of those trials. While our revenue from sales of products and services to our biologics and drug delivery customers is indicative of growth, the number of Partner relationships is also of importance as we recognize the possibility that some Partners research will reach commercial success, and others may not. To the extent our Partners achieve commercial success, our expectation is that we will share in such success through our Partners use of our products and services in their delivery of therapies. At September 30, 2024, we had more than 50 Partners, which is similar to the number of Partners as of the same date in 2023. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue includes the direct costs associated with the assembly and purchase of components for neurosurgery navigation products, biologics and drug delivery products, non-neurosurgery therapy products, and ClearPoint capital equipment and software that we have sold, and for which we have recognized the revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as well as labor hours and materials for the cost of providing preclinical, consulting, and service 
 20 

revenue. Cost of revenue also includes the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and depreciation of loaned systems installed under our ClearPoint placement program, as well as provisions for obsolete, impaired, or excess inventory. 
 Research and Development Costs 
 Our research and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the conceptualization, design, testing, and prototyping of our ClearPoint system products and enhancements. Such costs include salaries, travel, and benefits for research and development personnel; materials and laboratory supplies in research and development activities; outside consultant costs; and licensing costs related to technology not yet commercialized. We anticipate that, over time, our research and development costs may increase as we: (i) develop devices and services for delivery of therapeutics into the central nervous system; (ii) expand products into the operating room and therapeutics space; and (iii) expand the application of our technological platforms internationally. 
 Product development timelines, likelihood of success, and total costs can vary widely by product candidate. There are also risks inherent in the regulatory clearance and approval process. At this time, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in our efforts to expand the application of our technological platforms. 
 Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, travel and benefits, including share-based compensation; marketing costs; professional fees, including fees for outside attorneys and accountants; occupancy costs; insurance; and other general and administrative expenses, which include, but are not limited to, corporate licenses, director fees, hiring costs, taxes, postage, office supplies, information technology and meeting costs. Our sales and marketing expenses are expected to continue to increase due to costs associated with the continued commercialization of our products and services and the increased headcount necessary to support growth in operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Biologics and drug delivery revenue, which includes sales of services and disposable products related to customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials utilizing our products, increased 27 to 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.5 million for the same period in 2023. Our overall revenue growth is attributable to a 1.6 million increase in product revenue resulting from higher demand for disposables as multiple partners progress in their trials, partially offset by a decrease of 0.7 million in service and other revenue due to a reduction in the number of preclinical studies performed, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Neurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue, which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, increased 49 to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is driven by higher product revenue of 1.0 million resulting from newly activated accounts, increased case count, and new product offerings, including the SmartFrame OR and Prism Laser Therapy, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Capital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software and related services, increased 133 to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.4 million for the same period in 2023 due to an increase in the placements of ClearPoint navigation capital equipment and software and Prism laser units. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Cost of revenue was 3.3 million, resulting in gross profit of 4.8 million and gross margin of 60 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was 2.5 million, resulting in gross profit of 3.3 million and gross margin of 57 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the transition to the new manufacturing facility, occurring in 2023, and higher volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs were 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 0.9 million, or 36 . The increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs and product and software development costs, each in the amount of 0.5 million, partially offset by lower trial costs of 0.1 million. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 0.7 million, or 25 . This increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs, including share-based compensation, of 0.6 million resulting from increases in headcount, and increased travel costs of 0.1 million. 
 22 

General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses were 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.9 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 0.3 million, or 9 . This increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs and share-based compensation of 0.4 million, higher occupancy costs of 0.2 million, and higher professional fees of 0.1 million, partially offset by lower bad debt expense of 0.5 million mainly as a result of subsequent recoveries. 
 Interest Income (Expense). Net interest income was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.1 million for the same period in 2023, as a result of increased investment in U.S. Government debt securities stemming from the capital raise in March 2024 as well as lower interest expense due to the early repayment of the First Closing Note.

Biologics and drug delivery revenue, which includes sales of services and disposable products related to customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials utilizing our products, increased 37 to 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.5 million for the same period in 2023. Our overall revenue growth is attributable to a 2.9 million increase in product revenue resulting from higher demand for disposables as multiple partners progress in their trials, and a 0.6 million increase in service and other revenue related to new preclinical trials and service agreements entered into with our Partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Neurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue, which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, increased 14 to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.5 million for the same period in 2023. Product revenue increased 33 , or 1.8 million , resulting from newly activated accounts, increased case count, and new product offerings, including the SmartFrame OR and Prism Laser Therapy, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This was partially offset by a decrease in service and other revenue of 0.9 million primarily as a result of pausing a co-development program with one of our Brain Computer Interface partners. 
 Capital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software and related services, increased 180 to 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.1 million for the same period in 2023 due to an increase in the placements of ClearPoint navigation capital equipment and software and Prism laser units. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Cost of revenue was 9.3 million, resulting in gross profit of 14.4 million and gross margin of 61 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was 7.5 million, resulting in gross profit of 9.6 million and gross margin of 56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the transition to the new manufacturing facility, occurring in 2023, and higher volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs were relatively flat at 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Personnel costs, including share-based compensation, were higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 0.7 million as compared to the same period in 2023. This was offset by lower product and software development costs of 0.7 million as a result of reprioritization of certain research and development initiatives. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.4 million, or 15 . This increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs, including share-based compensation, of 1.1 million resulting from increases in headcount, and increased travel costs of 0.3 million. 
 General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses were 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.0 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 0.3 million, or 3 . This decrease was due primarily to lower bad debt expense of 1.4 million mainly as a result of subsequent recoveries, partially offset by higher personnel costs and share-based compensation of 0.8 million and higher occupancy costs of 0.3 million. 
 Interest Income (Expense). Net interest income was 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million for the same period in 2023, as a result of increased investment in U.S. Government debt securities stemming from the capital raise in March 2024 as well as lower interest expense due to the early repayment of the First Closing Note. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception, which has resulted in a cumulative deficit at September 30, 2024 of 186.0 million. In addition, our use of cash from operations amounted to 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Since inception, we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of notes payable. As discussed in Note 8, in March 2024, we completed a public offering of 2,653,848 shares of our common stock from which the net proceeds totaled approximately 16.2 million after deducting our payment of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. 
 24 

In August 2024, we repaid in full the remaining 10 million outstanding under the SPA entered into in 2020, pursuant to which we issued secured convertible notes to two investors raising gross proceeds of 25 million, of which 15 million had been previously converted to common stock. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included above in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report for additional information with respect to the secured convertible notes. 
 As a result of these transactions and our business operations, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 21.6 million at September 30, 2024. In management s opinion, based on our current forecasts for revenue, expense and cash flows, our existing cash and cash equivalent balances at September 30, 2024, are sufficient to support our operations and meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is summarized as follows: 
 Nine months ended 
 September 30, 
 (in thousands) 2024 
 2023 
 Cash used in operating activities (7,707) (12,551) Cash (used in) provided by investing activities 
 (12) 9,137 Cash provided by financing activities 6,152 141 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,567) (3,273) 
 Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 7.7 million, a decrease of 4.8 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a lower net loss of 3.9 million, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of 1.1 million, partially offset by a net decrease in non-cash items of 0.2 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by lower deferred revenue. The change in the non-cash items results primarily from recoveries in the allowance for credit losses, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. 
 Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were nominal and related to equipment acquisitions. 
 Net cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were 9.1 million and consisted of proceeds from the maturities of short-term investments, partially offset primarily by equipment acquisitions related to our new manufacturing site in Carlsbad, California. 
 Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of proceeds, net of offering costs, of 16.2 million received from the public offering of our common stock and 0.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan. This is partially offset by the repayment of the 2020 secured convertible note of 10.0 million and payments of 0.3 million for taxes related to shares withheld in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards. 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments for taxes related to shares withheld in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards. 
 
 Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements 
 To date, we have not achieved profitability. We could continue to incur net losses as we continue our efforts to expand the commercialization of our products and services and pursue additional applications for our technology platforms. Our cash balances are primarily held in a variety of demand accounts with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of medical devices, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to 
 25 

successfully commercialize our products and pursue additional applications for our technology platforms. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 the ability of our Partners to achieve commercial success, including their use of our products and services in their preclinical studies, clinical trials and delivery of therapies; 
 the ultimate duration and impact of macroeconomic trends, including inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including military conflicts), and legislative and political developments; 
 the ability to maintain our existing relationships with our Partners and to enter into new relationships; 
 the timing of broader market acceptance and adoption of our products; 
 the scope, rate of progress and cost of our ongoing product development activities relating to our products; 
 the cost and timing of expanding our sales, clinical support, marketing and distribution capabilities, and other corporate infrastructure; 
 the cost and timing of establishing inventories at levels sufficient to support our sales; 
 the effect of competing technological and market developments; 
 the cost of pursuing additional applications of our technology platforms under current collaborative arrangements, and the terms and timing of any future collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish; 
 the cost and timing of any clinical trials; 
 the cost and timing of regulatory filings, clearances and approvals; and 
 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 
 26 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to interest income and expense sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. 
 Our investments are in short-term bank deposits, short-term U.S. Government debt securities, and institutional money market funds. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk. In the event we invest in short-term investments, due to the nature of our short-term investments and the Company's intent to hold such debt securities to maturity, we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 To date, we have not recorded a significant amount of sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and have only limited business transactions in foreign currencies. We do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce our foreign currency risks, which at present, are not material. We do not believe we have material exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates at this time. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our internal processes relating to foreign currency exchange, including the potential use of hedging strategies. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within our organization. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 We are involved from time-to-time with various legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and legal proceedings are of a nature we believe are normal and incidental to a medical device company, and may include product liability, intellectual property, employment matters, and other general claims. 
 We make provisions for liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such provisions are assessed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of any settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claim that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
