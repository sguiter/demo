of the equity in Roshing
International Co., Limited Roshing ), which is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services including
ocean freight forwarding and related logistics solutions, distributing electronic components and providing software services. Pursuant
to the Exchange Agreement, on March 6, 2023 RQS Capital transferred all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of RQS United to the
Company, and the Company issued to RQS Capital 1,500,000 shares of our common stock and paid a cash price of 350,000 (the Share
Exchange ). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company also issued a total of 700,000 shares of our common stock to nine employees
or affiliates of Roshing to induce continued services to Roshing. 

As a result of the Share Exchange, RQS United
became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former RQS United stockholder became our controlling stockholder. The share exchange transaction
was treated as a reverse acquisition, with RQS United as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party for accounting purposes. Unless
the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation
of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of RQS United and its consolidated subsidiary,
Roshing. 

Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company was
a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement, the Company
ceased to be a shell company. 

RQS United is a holding company incorporated
on November 4, 2022 in the Republic of Seychelles. RQS United has no substantive operations other than holding 90 of the outstanding
share capital of its subsidiary, Roshing, which was incorporated on June 22, 2011 in Hong Kong, is principally engaged in global
logistics services. Less than 4 of its revenue for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 was derived from other business lines: sales of
electronic device hardware components, development of logistics software and websites, technical consulting, and software maintenance.
Roshing s business is primarily carried out in Hong Kong. 

Results of the three months ended October
31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending July 31, 2025 or any other future periods. 

allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary. 

The accounting standard defines fair value,
establishes as a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair
value measures. The three levels are defined as follow: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in inactive markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. 

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

Financial instruments included in current
assets and current liabilities (such as cash, accounts receivable, due from related party, accounts payable, and due to related parties)
are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short period of time between the
origination of such instruments and their expected realization. 

The Company evaluates whether amounts billed
to customers should be reported as gross or net revenue. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis when the Company is primarily responsible
for fulfilling the promise to provide the services, when it assumes risk of loss, when it has discretion in setting the prices for the
services to the customers, and when the Company has the ability to direct the use of the services provided by the third party. In most
cases we act as an indirect carrier. When acting as an indirect carrier, we issue a Fixture Note to customers as the contract of carriage.
In turn, when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier, we receive a Master Ocean Bill of Lading. 

The Company s evaluation determined
that it is in control of establishing the transaction price, managing all aspects of the shipment process and assumes the risk of loss
for delivery, collection, and returns. Based on its evaluation of the control of services and risk involved, the Company determined that
it acts as a principal rather than an agent in global logistics service arrangements and such revenues are reported on a gross basis. 

b. Electronic Device Hardware Components
Products Sales 

The Company is a distributor of
electronic device hardware components and generates revenue through resale of these components. The Company s products include
high performance computer chips, Wi-Fi modules, Bluetooth modules, 4G network modules, LED screens, and touch screens. In accordance
with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition: Principal Agent Consideration, an entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or
service before that good or service is transferred to a customer. Otherwise, the entity is an agent in the transaction. The Company
evaluates three indicators of control in accordance with ASC 606: 1) For hardware sales, the Company is the most visible entity to
customers and assumes fulfillment risk and risks related to the acceptability of products, including addressing customer complaints
directly and handling of product returns or refunds directly; 2) The Company is exposed to inventory risk before transfer of
control to customers; and 3) The Company determines the resale price of hardware products. After evaluating the above circumstances,
the Company considers itself the principal of these arrangements and records hardware sales revenue on a gross basis. 

Hardware sales contracts are on a fixed price
basis with no separate sales rebate, discount, or other incentive. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the Company has delivered
products that have been accepted by its customer with no future obligations. The Company generally permits returns of products due to
product failure; however, returns are historically insignificant. 

c. Software and Website Development
Services 

The Company generates revenue by developing
customized freight shipping and related logistic software and websites, which are generally on a fixed-priced basis. The software helps
wholesalers, ecommerce retailers, and freight shipping providers to manage complex workflows and improve work efficiency. The Company
generally has no enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and is only entitled to payment after software is fully
developed, delivered, tested, and accepted by the customer. As a result, revenues from software development contracts are recognized at
a point in time when services are fully rendered, and written acceptances have been received from customers. 

d. Technical Consulting and Training
Services 

The Company provides technical consulting
and training services to help customers, generally its existing customers, to better understand and properly use its customized software
and related hardware. Services are generally carried out on a per-time fixed rate basis. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when
service is rendered and the customer confirms the completion of consulting or training. 

e. Software Maintenance and Business
Promotion Services 

The Company provides software maintenance
services to keep customers software up to date and assists customers in promoting business with ongoing marketing support. The
Company charges a flat rate for a fixed duration on a subscription basis, generally 12 months. Revenue is recognized ratably each month
over the contract period. 

f. Business Consulting Services 

The Company provides business consulting services
to help customers apply for immigration and non-immigration visas. The Company is responsible for performing background checks, case analysis,
and preparing related application paper works. The Company charges a flat fee for the visa application services. Revenue is recognized
at a point in time when an application is submitted with proper authorities. 

for the three
months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling and marketing
expenses. 

right of use ROU asset and operating lease liabilities in January 2023 based
on the present value of the future minimum rental payments of leases, using an incremental borrowing rate of . 

The Company determines if a contract contains
a lease at inception. US GAAP requires that the Company s leases be evaluated and classified as operating or finance leases for
financial reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation
includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods
when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty.
All of the Company s real estate leases are classified as operating leases. 

Lease payments for an operating lease transitioning
to ASC 842 using the effective date are based on future payments at the transition date and on the present value of lease payments over
the remaining lease term. Since the implicit rate for the Company s leases is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental
borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the
lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term. 

Lease terms used to calculate the present
value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as the Company does not have reasonable
certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers the economic life of its operating
lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception;
therefore, operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Lease expense
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

The Company reviews the impairment of its
ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived
assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment
of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax
cash flows of the related operations. 

The lease for the Company s Hong Kong
office facility was early terminated in September 2023, which resulted in a derecognition of right of use ROU asset and operating lease liabilities in August 2023. 

for failure to update certain foreign-owned information schedules in a timely manner. The penalty
is included in other expense in the statements of operations for the year ended July 31, 2024. During the three months ended October 31,
2024, the Company received a refund from the IRS for the penalty previously charged. The refund is included in other income in
the statements of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2024. 

The Hong Kong tax returns filed for 2019 and
subsequent years are subject to examination by the applicable tax authorities.

ownership interest in Roshing. The noncontrolling interest is presented in the consolidated
balance sheets separately from stockholders equity attributable to Tianci. Noncontrolling interest in the results of Roshing are
presented on the consolidated statements of operations as allocations of the total income or loss of Roshing between the noncontrolling
interest holder and the shareholders of RQS United. 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting
for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application
of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of this standard on August 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Except as mentioned above, the Company does
not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the
Company s consolidated Financial Statements.

has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately at October 31, 2024. Management has not determined that it is more
likely than not that this carryforward will be realized and thus the Company maintained a 100 valuation allowance for the deferred tax
asset relating to the United States net operating loss carryforward. Current United States income tax law limits the amount of loss available
to offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. 

Uncertain tax positions 

The Company evaluates each uncertain tax position
(including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measures the unrecognized benefits
associated with the tax positions. As of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, the Company did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain
tax positions. 

As of July 31, 2024, tax years 2021 and forward
generally remain open for examination for United States Federal and State tax purposes and tax years 2019 and forward generally remain
open for examination for Hong Kong tax purposes. 

. As of October 31, 2024, no United States account balance exceeded
 250,000. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board pays compensation up to a limit of HKD (approximately US if
the bank with which an individual/company holds its eligible deposit fails. As of October 31, 2024, a cash balance of was maintained
at a financial institution in Hong Kong of which approximately was subject to credit risk. Management believes that the
financial institution is of high credit quality and continually monitors its credit worthiness. 

Customer concentration risk 

For the three months ended October 31, 2024,
two customers accounted for , and of the Company s total revenues. 

For the three months ended October 31, 2023,
two customers accounted for and of the Company s total revenues. 

Vendor concentration risk 

For the year ended July 31, 2024, three vendors
accounted for , and of the Company s total purchases. For the three months ended October 31, 2023, two vendors
accounted for and of the Company s total purchases. 

(approximately ). On January 13, 2023, the Company entered a new operating lease agreement for office
space in Hong Kong with a third party for two years with monthly rent of HKD (approximately ). Upon adoption of ASU
2016-02 effective August 1, 2022, the Company recognized a right of use ROU asset and operating lease liabilities
in January 2023 based on the present value of the future minimum rental payments of leases, using an incremental borrowing rate of .
The Company s lease agreement does not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The lease
does not contain an option to extend at the time of expiration. The lease was early terminated in September 2023 which resulted in a derecognition
of right of use ROU asset and operating lease liabilities in August 2023. 

In September 2023, the Company entered into
a one-year office rental service agreement with a monthly lease payment of approximately (HKD ). In September 2024, the Company
further renewed the lease for one year with a monthly lease payment of approximately (HKD ). 

Rent expenses were and for
the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

On March 3, 2023, we acquired
ownership of RQS United Group Limited, a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles RQS United ),
pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement dated March 3, 2023 among the Company, RQS United and RQS Capital Limited, the prior owner of
RQS United. 

RQS United is a holding
company incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles. RQS United has no operations other than holding 90 of the outstanding share capital
of its subsidiary, Roshing International Co., Limited, a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong Roshing ).
Roshing was incorporated on June 22, 2011 and is primarily engaged in logistics solutions, including shipping operation management. We
also generate a small portion of our revenue from our non-core businesses that we carry on through Roshing, including software development
services, consulting services, and the sale of electronic parts. 

Our primary line of business
is global logistics. The Company, through its subsidiary, Roshing, provides global logistics services, encompassing booking and the transportation
arrangement and related logistics solutions. Roshing s customized logistics solutions are tailored to meet the diverse needs of
its customers. 

For the container shipping
service, Roshing charters cargo space from shipping suppliers (such as shipowners, ship carrier or non-vessel operating common carriers)
and then sub-charters that space to its customers (cargo owners or cargo agents). For the bulk goods shipping service, Roshing issues
fixture notes to customers, and then arranges the booking of ships, and signs chartering contracts with suppliers (such as shipowners).
Roshing also tailors the selection of transport options, and arranges to transport the goods from the port of loading to the port of destination,
so as to complete the performance of the contract. 

Roshing currently does
not own or operate any transportation assets. By leveraging our senior management s expertise in the global logistics industry and
adopting an asset-light strategy at the early stage, Roshing has seen a significant growth in logistics revenue during year ended July
31, 2024. Shufang Gao, our Chief Executive Officer previously worked for a globally renowned shipping conglomerate, with over 20 years
of management experience. His expertise spans shipping operation management, and logistics transportation. Leveraging this experience,
he has provided the Company with the managerial framework to expand its global logistics business, as well as access to relevant customer
and supplier resources in the shipping industry. Roshing s business is primarily carried out in Hong Kong and other locations in
the Asia-Pacific region, mainly in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam. Roshing s logistics services also include the shipment of goods
to African countries. 

Roshing also generates
revenue from the sale of electronic parts, and certain business and technical consulting services, independent from its global logistics
business. 

Key factors that
affect operating results 

Our performance of operations
and financial conditions have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by a number of factors which are set forth below. 

Economic Conditions
in Hong Kong. We are a Nevada company with operations conducted by our subsidiary Roshing, which is based in Hong Kong. Accordingly,
if Hong Kong experiences any adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions due to events beyond our control, such as local economic
downturn, natural disasters, contagious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks, or if the government adopts regulations that place restrictions
or burdens on us or on our industry in general, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially
and adversely affected. 

22 

International Trade
Environment. The demand for our shipping operation services is driven by the levels of international trade, which is in turn
affected by global political, economic or social conditions. Any changes in a particular country s trade policy could trigger retaliatory
actions by affected countries, potentially eventually resulting in a trade war, which could increase the cost of goods and thus reduce
customer demand for products if the parties have to pay tariffs which increase their prices or if trading partners limit their trade with
the particular country. Our business is also susceptible to downturns and disruptions in the business activities of their direct customers
that are beyond their control. If sales in a particular geographical market in which our direct customers target operate in decline, due
to unstable regional and/or global political and economic conditions, such decline will likely lead to a corresponding plunge in the international
trade volume which, in turn, could reduce the demand for freight forward and adversely affect our results of operations. 

Our Ability to Source
Cargo Space from Vendors on a Cost-Efficient Manner. A significant portion of our cost of revenue is the fee that we paid to
our vendors. As a result, our results of operation depend on our ability to source vendors in a cost-efficient manner by obtaining a favorable
price and effectively control the cost.

Revenues 

For the three months ended
October 31, 2024, our total revenue increased to 2,980,940 from 1,326,648 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The increase
was mainly attributable to the continuing growth of our global logistics service and expansion of our client base. The global logistics
service contributed 93 of our total revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024. 

23 

The rest of our business
lines represented 7 of our revenue in this quarter. We expect our operations other than global logistics to continue to contribute a
relatively small portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.

Cost of Revenues 

Total cost of revenues
increased from 1,092,871 to 2,752,509 for the three months ended October 31, 2024. The increase was in line with the growth of our global
logistics services. 

A breakdown of our cost
of revenues is summarized as follows:

services primarily includes the cargo space charged by direct ocean carriers, fees charged by freight forwarders, fees charged for ancillary
logistics services, and compensation we paid to our logistics employees.

Gross Profit

 17.62 

Our total gross profit
decreased by 5,346 to 228,431 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. The decrease
in gross profit was primarily attributable to decreasing gross profit from hardware product sales and other services, partially offset
by a slight increase in gross profit from global logistics services. For the three months ended October 31, 2024, our total gross profit
margin was 7.66 , as compared to 17.62 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. Our gross margin from our dominant business line
global logistics service dropped significantly to 6.12 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 from 12.84 for the three months ended
October 31, 2023. The same trend applies to our other business lines as we adopted a competitive pricing strategy to build up our client
base promptly in the short term. We anticipate that our gross margin realized from logistics services will fluctuate in the short-term
as the result of our pricing strategy. 

Operating Expenses 

As our business grew, there
was a significant increase in our total operating expenses, which were 345,581 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared
to 220,776 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. Our operating expenses primarily include payroll expenses, commissions, marketing,
rent and professional fees relating to our obligations as a public company. The increase was mainly due to the increase in general and
administrative expenses from 118,705 for the three months ended October 31, 2023 to 260,363 for the three months ended October 31, 2024,
partially offset by a 16,883 decrease in selling and marketing expenses in the same period. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was attributable to increasing payroll expenses necessitated by the expansion of our logistics operations, as well as expenses
incurred in anticipation of a securities offering as we prepare the Company to list on Nasdaq. The decrease in selling expenses during
this period is attributable to decreasing commission expenses that we paid to third-parties as we became less dependent on brokers for
new businesses. 

Income tax expense 

Our income tax expense
amounted to 2,189 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to 19,113 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The
change was due to the decrease in operating income generated by Roshing during this period. 

25 

Net income (loss) 

As a result of the foregoing,
we incurred a net loss of 91,948 for the three months ended October 31, 2024. As the Company owns only 90 shares of its operating subsidiary,
Roshing, 10 of the net income realized by Roshing was attributed to the minority interest. Therefore, the net loss for the three months
ended October 31, 2024 attributable to the shareholders of the Company was 93,056. In comparison, during the three months ended October
31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of 6,112. 

Liquidity and
Capital Resources 

In assessing our liquidity,
we monitor and analyze our cash on-hand and our operating expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital
requirements and operating expenses obligations. As of October 31, 2024, we had working capital of 696,406, as our cash amounted to 323,793,
our current assets were 894,314 and our current liabilities were 197,908. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through
capital contributions and advances from shareholders, as well as private investors. At October 31, 2024 we owed 2,271 to our related
parties (See Note 4 to the financial statements). 

We believe that our liquidity
and working capital will be sufficient to sustain our business operation for the next twelve months. We may, however, need additional
cash resources in the future if there are changes in business conditions or other developments or if the company finds and wishes to pursue
opportunities for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure, or similar actions. 

We started providing logistics
services during the quarter ended October 31, 2023. Although the business grew rapidly during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, we
may require significant capital expenditure in order to obtain additional market share. If we determine that our cash requirements exceed
the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have on hand at the time, we may seek to issue equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities.
The issuance and sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in
increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. Our obligation to bear credit
risk for certain financing transactions we facilitate may also strain our operating cash flow. We cannot assure you that financing will
be in place or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 

The following table summarizes
the key components of our cash flows for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023.

Operating activities 

Net cash of 15,211
used in operating activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily the result of net loss of 91,948, which was only
partially offset by a 73,768 increase in accrued liabilities and other payables. 

Net cash of 124,524 provided
by operating activities for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable of 195,232
and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of 140,354 which was partially offset by the increase of 195,629 in accounts
receivable. 

26 

Investing activities 

The company had no investing
activities during the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Financing activities 

Net cash used in financing
activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 74,125 which was attributable to the payment of fees incurred in anticipation
of a public offering of the Company s securities. 

Critical Accounting
Estimates 

Our financial statements
and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying
notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

In connection with the
preparation of our financial statements for the three months ended October 31, 2024, there was one accounting estimate we made that was
subject to a high degree of uncertainty and was critical to our results. This was the accrual as deferred offering costs 
of amounts we have paid to professionals and others for services rendered and to be rendered in connection with a public offering of the
Company s securities. We will realize the value of these assets (and offset them against proceeds of the offering) only if the offering
is placed successfully. We have accrued the payments as assets because we anticipate a successful offering. If, however, the offering
fails to close, we will be required to amortize the asset as an expense. 

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements 

The Company considers the
applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates ASUs ). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards
that are issued. The Company does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted,
would have a material effect on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, 

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures . 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

27 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms as a result of the following material weaknesses: 

There is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is limited in number, resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible. 

There is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions. The Company utilizes a third-party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third-party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions. 

Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate
the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is
committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15
or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
