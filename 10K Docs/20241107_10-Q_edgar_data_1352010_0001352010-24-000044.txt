 Risks and Uncertainties As a result of its global operations, the Company may be subject to certain inherent risks. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of cash and cash equivalents in banks in Ukraine and million of cash and cash equivalents in banks in Belarus. The Company regularly monitors cash held in these countries and, to the extent the cash held exceeds amounts required to support its operations in these countries, the Company distributes the excess funds into markets with more developed banking sectors to the extent it is possible to do so. In April 2024, Belarus instituted new restrictions on distributing dividends from Belarus to shareholders in certain countries, including the U.S. The restrictions are initially scheduled to remain in place until the end of 2025 and may prevent EPAM from distributing excess funds, if any, out of Belarus. The Company does not expect these new restrictions to have a material impact on its ability to meet its worldwide cash obligations during this period. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions considered stable in the region, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business. However, a banking crisis, bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold the Company s funds, or sanctions may result in the loss of deposits or adversely affect the Company s ability to complete banking transactions, which could adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition.

 Commitments for Future Equity Awards 
 In connection with the Company s acquisitions of businesses as discussed in Note 3 Acquisitions, EPAM enters into agreements that contractually commit it to granting equity awards at future dates. The agreements are unique to each acquisition and terms vary, including specifying either the number of future awards to be issued or a monetary value that will be settled with equity awards valued at future stock prices. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has commitments to grant up to million of equity awards with the number of awards to be determined based on future stock prices. Additionally, these awards contain performance criteria that will determine the number of future awards to be issued and there is a service-based vesting requirement after the grant date associated with these awards. As these awards are considered granted for accounting purposes, in determining the expense, the Company adjusts the expected settlement based on the probability of achievement of the performance criteria. Related to these awards, the amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was not material.

The share repurchase program has a term of months, may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the company to acquire any amount of common stock.

 Business Update Regarding the War in Ukraine 
 On February 24, 2022, Russian forces attacked Ukraine and its people and EPAM has repeatedly called for an immediate end to this unlawful and unconscionable attack. EPAM s highest priority is the safety and security of its employees and their families in Ukraine as well as in the broader region, and we have continued to support relocating our employees to lower risk locations, both within Ukraine and to other countries where we operate. The vast majority of our Ukraine employees are in safe locations and operating at levels of productivity consistent with those achieved prior to the attack.

 The impact of Russia s invasion of Ukraine on our operations, personnel, and physical assets in Ukraine has had, and, along with any escalation of the war that includes Belarus territory or military, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations. Actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Belarus, and Belarus responses to those sanctions, including counter-sanctions and other actions, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations. Clients have and may continue to seek altered terms, conditions, and delivery locations for the performance of services, delay planned work or seek services from alternate providers, or suspend, terminate, fail to renew, or reduce existing contracts or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Some of our clients have implemented steps to block internet communications with Ukraine and Belarus to protect against potential cyberattacks or other information security threats, which has caused a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver our services to these clients from those locations. Such material adverse effects disrupt our delivery of services, cause us to shift all or portions of our work occurring in the region to other countries, restrict our ability to engage in certain projects in the region and serve certain clients in or from the region, and could negatively impact our personnel, operations, financial results and business outlook. Our Board of Directors continues its oversight of our strategic, geopolitical, and cybersecurity risks and the risks related to our geographic expansion. Our Board has received updates from management during both regular and special meetings, while also providing oversight of the risks associated with Russia s invasion of Ukraine and other strategic areas of importance related to the war. 
 Moving Forward 
 We continue to execute our business continuity plans and adapt to developments as they occur to protect the safety of our people and address impacts on our delivery infrastructure, including reallocating work to other geographies within our global footprint. We have engaged both our personnel and our clients to meet their needs while mitigating delivery challenges. EPAM continues to operate productively in more than 55 countries and provides consistent high-quality delivery to our clients. Our global delivery centers have sufficient resources, including infrastructure and capital, to support ongoing operations. We continue to rapidly respond to the difficult conditions in Ukraine while maintaining a focus on our clients and long-term growth. 
 The implementation and execution of our business continuity plans, relocation costs, our humanitarian commitment to our people in Ukraine, and the cost of our phased exit from Russia resulted in materially increased expenses. Some of these expenses continued during this quarter and we expect some of these expenses will continue to occur in subsequent quarters for some time in the future. 
 We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the war in Ukraine because the conflict and government reactions change quickly and are beyond our control. Prolonged military activities, broad-based sanctions and counter-sanctions, or escalation of the war that includes Belarus territory or military could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. The information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our control or present awareness. For additional information on the various risks posed by the attack against Ukraine and the impact in the region as well as other risks to our business, please read Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this quarterly report. 
 
 Year-to-Date 2024 Developments and Trends 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our revenues were 3.480 billion, a decrease of 1.5 from 3.533 billion reported for the same period of 2023. Our business and operating results were negatively impacted in the first nine months of 2024 by a decline at a former top-10 client included in our Business Information Media vertical, however, there was moderate improvement in the remainder of our customer portfolio as evidenced by an overall 1.8 sequential growth from the second to third quarter of 2024. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely driven by a 52.0 million benefit from the Poland research and development incentives as well as the recognition of a 25.9 million loss from the sale of the Russia business in 2023 partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a recurring basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances, impairments of long-lived assets including intangible assets, goodwill and right-of-use assets, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Consolidated Results Review 
 
 Revenues 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenues increased by 1.3 to 1.168 billion compared to the corresponding period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, revenues have been positively impacted by stabilizing demand for our services and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our revenue growth by 0.4 , partially offset by the sale of our remaining holdings in Russia in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Revenues by client location for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) (in thousands, except percentages) Americas (1)

 (3) APAC includes revenues from clients in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Australia. 
 (4) CEE includes revenues from clients in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. As a result of the Company s exit from Russia and sale of the Company s remaining holdings in Russia to a third-party on July 26, 2023, revenues from the CEE region are no longer material. Beginning in 2024, revenues from the CEE region are included in the EMEA region. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the United States continued to be our largest client location. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues in the United States increased 2.2 to 666.9 million from 652.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, largely due to increased spending at certain large accounts in the region. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues in the United States increased to 1.997 billion as compared to 1.982 billion in the same period of the prior year. 
 The top three revenue contributing countries by client location in EMEA were the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany, generating 126.0 million, 104.3 million and 53.6 million in revenues, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues from clients in these three countries were 140.7 million, 91.5 million, and 44.8 million, respectively, in the corresponding period last year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany performed as EMEA s top revenue generating locations and contributed 389.7 million, 304.0 million, and 153.6 million, respectively, compared to 448.5 million, 270.9 million, and 132.6 million, respectively, in the corresponding period last year. Revenues in the EMEA region were negatively impacted by reduced spending at certain large accounts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the previous year. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from clients in the APAC region increased by 0.4 million or 1.8 mainly due to growth in the Life Sciences Healthcare vertical and decreased by 3.2 million or 4.2 mainly due to a decline in the Financial Services vertical, compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. 
 
 Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) 
 The principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, and project-related travel costs for our delivery professionals and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to client projects. Salaries and other compensation expenses of our delivery professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing services for clients during a given period. Our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and, therefore, we are continuously exploring new geographies, markets, and sources to locate talented personnel and present them with competitive compensation programs and educational opportunities.

Table of Contents 

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 764.0 million representing a decrease of 3.8 from 794.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 52.0 million benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2024 for government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland partially offset by higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expense and 4.6 million in reduced benefits from our hedging program. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 65.4 and 68.9 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year is primarily due to the benefit recognized for government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland and improved utilization, partially offset by an increase in compensation costs including stock-based compensation expense, as a percentage of revenues. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 2.409 billion representing a decrease of 2.0 from 2.459 billion in the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 52.0 million benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2024 for the government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland and a decrease in compensation costs other than stock-based compensation expense largely attributable to the 6.1 decrease in the average number of production professionals which reflects the impact from the Cost Optimization Programs initiated in the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the impacts from salary increases and promotions for existing professionals. See Note 9 Cost Optimization Programs for more information regarding the Company s restructuring programs. The decreases were partially offset by a 9.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, the negative impact from the appreciation of foreign currencies in certain of our delivery locations and reduced benefits from our hedging program. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 69.3 and 69.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to the 52.0 million benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2024 for government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland and improved utilization, partially offset by a 9.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, reduced benefits from our hedging program and the negative impact from the appreciation of foreign currencies in certain of our delivery locations. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenditures associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business. These expenses include the costs of salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, severance, bad debt, travel, legal and accounting services, insurance, facilities including operating leases, advertising, and other promotional activities. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses contain costs of relocating our employees and various one-time and unusual expenses such as impairment charges. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses were 206.8 million representing a 6.2 increase as compared to 194.8 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly driven by a 6.1 million increase in professional fee expenses related to our business acquisition efforts, an increase in compensation costs impacted by salary increases and promotions for existing professionals, a 2.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a 1.9 million increase in employee separation costs resulting from the Cost Optimization Programs initiated in the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. See Note 9 Cost Optimization Programs for more information regarding the Company s restructuring programs. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter was partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease in bad debt expense as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.8 to 17.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period from the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in professional fee expenses related to our business acquisition efforts and personnel-related costs as a percentage of revenues. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses were 599.3 million representing a 0.3 decrease as compared to 601.1 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year was primarily driven by a 5.8 million decrease in bad debt expense and a 4.0 million reduction in facilities and infrastructure expenses as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a 3.5 million increase in personnel-related costs including severance, which reflects the impact from the Cost Optimization Programs initiated in the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 and the impacts from salary increases and promotions for existing professionals as well as a 6.0 million increase in professional fee expenses related to our business acquisition efforts. See Note 9 Cost Optimization Programs for more information regarding the Company s restructuring programs. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.2 to 17.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period from the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in professional fee expenses related to our business acquisition efforts and personnel-related costs as a percentage of revenues.

 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense was 19.7 million and 63.0 million, respectively, as compared to 23.1 million and 68.6 million, respectively, in the corresponding period last year. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of lower depreciation on furniture, fixtures, other equipment and computer hardware, partially offset by increased amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 1.7 and 1.8 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2.0 in both corresponding periods of 2023. 
 
 Interest and Other Income, Net 
 Interest and other income, net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, gains and losses from certain financial instruments, interest expense related to our borrowings, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. Interest and other income, net was 13.3 million and 40.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 13.9 million and 37.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The decrease in Interest and other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was largely driven by a 1.0 million decrease in interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and a 1.2 million increase in loss due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration. The increase in Interest and other income, net during the nine months September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was largely driven by an 8.6 million increase in interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, partially offset by a 3.7 million decrease in government grant income and a 2.2 million increase in loss due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Loss 
 For discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 In determining its interim provision for income taxes, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual profit before tax, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Certain significant or unusual items are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur and can be a source of variability in the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter. 
 Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and an y potential related valuation allowances involves judgment. We consider factors that may contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the overall effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future. These factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits/tax shortfalls upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items. 
 Our effective tax rate was 28.1 and 21.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 26.3 and 21.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We recorded a tax shortfall upon vesting or exercise of stock awards of 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of stock awards of 20.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to excess tax benefits of 1.7 million and 15.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of the receipt of government incentives related to conducting R D activities in Poland, which resulted in a 2.3 and 1.0 increase in the effective tax, respectively, and the non-deductibility of certain acquisition costs for tax purposes resulted in a 1.4 and 0.6 increase in the effective tax, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s effective tax rate increased due to a 3.6 million charge in the third quarter associated with the completion of EPAM s exit from Russia.

 Results by Business Segment 
 Our operations have historically consisted of three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Russia. On July 26, 2023, we completed the sale of our remaining holdings in Russia to a third party and as a result of this sale, we no longer have operations associated with the Russia segment. The segments represent components of EPAM for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker CODM ), to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. Our CODM makes business decisions based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. Certain corporate expenses are not allocated to specific segments as these expenses are not controllable at the segment level. Such expenses include certain types of professional fees, certain taxes included in operating expenses, compensation to non-employee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses, including compensation of specific groups of non-production employees. In addition, the Company does not allocate stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, goodwill and other asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time charges and benefits. These unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations. 
 We manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for the client base and market. As managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client s geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. In some cases, managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of EPAM s senior management team. In such cases, the client s activity would be reported through the respective management team member s reportable segment. Our Europe segment includes our business in the APAC region, which is managed by the same management team. 
 Revenues from external clients and operating profit/(loss), before unallocated expenses, by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Segment revenues: North America 704,613 684,778 2,107,971 2,074,806 Europe 462,914 465,813 1,371,618 1,442,402 Russia 1,545 16,075 Total segment revenues 1,167,527 1,152,136 3,479,589 3,533,283 Segment operating profit/(loss): North America 155,570 132,438 399,072 386,929 Europe 94,862 64,074 209,919 188,779 Russia (118) (5,866) Total segment operating profit 250,432 196,394 608,991 569,842 

North America Segment 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues for the North America segment increased 19.8 million, or 2.9 , compared to the same period last year and segment operating profit increased 23.1 million, or 17.5 , compared to the same period last year. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from our North America segment were 60.4 of total segment revenues, an increase from 59.4 reported in the corresponding period of 2023. As a percentage of North America segment revenues, the North America segment s operating profit increased to 22.1 during the third quarter of 2024 from 19.3 in the third quarter of 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to higher utilization and government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense as a percentage of segment revenues during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.

Table of Contents 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues for the North America segment increased 33.2 million, or 1.6 , compared to the same period last year and segment operating profit increased 12.1 million, or 3.1 , compared to the same period last year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from our North America segment were 60.6 of total segment revenues, an increase from 58.7 reported in the corresponding period of 2023. As a percentage of North America segment revenues, the North America segment s operating profit increased to 18.9 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.6 in the corresponding period of 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to higher utilization and government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense as a percentage of segment revenues during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 The following table presents North America segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Dollars Percentage 2024 2023 Dollars Percentage Industry Vertical (in thousands, except percentages) Software Hi-Tech 131,145 136,520 (5,375) (3.9) 392,600 422,073 (29,473) (7.0) Financial Services 129,339 131,499 (2,160) (1.6) 377,000 410,527 (33,527) (8.2) Life Sciences Healthcare 120,659 109,137 11,522 10.6 362,983 305,700 57,283 18.7 Consumer Goods, Retail Travel 107,866 115,778 (7,912) (6.8) 339,556 359,475 (19,919) (5.5) Business Information Media 115,121 104,863 10,258 9.8 332,602 327,378 5,224 1.6 Emerging Verticals 100,483 86,981 13,502 15.5 303,230 249,653 53,577 21.5 Revenues 704,613 684,778 19,835 2.9 2,107,971 2,074,806 33,165 1.6 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, Software Hi-Tech remained the largest industry vertical in the North America segment, which was a result of the continued focus on engaging with our technology clients. However, a reduction in revenues from a former top 20 client and overall declines in the technology sector in the U.S. during 2023 impacted the revenues in this vertical. Financial Services declined 1.6 and 8.2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, largely impacted by decline in demand from a group of wealth management and insurance clients. Life Sciences Healthcare grew 10.6 and 18.7 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased demand from pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Consumer Goods, Retail Travel declined 6.8 and 5.5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to declines from clients in the retail industry, partially offset by growth from our travel clients. Business Information Media grew 9.8 and 1.6 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to improvement in demand from clients in the information services and entertainment sectors. Emerging Verticals grew 15.5 and 21.5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to growth from various clients in industries such as energy, professional services, industrial materials and educational platforms. 
 
 Europe Segment 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Europe s segment revenues were 462.9 million, representing a decrease of 2.9 million, or 0.6 , from the same period last year. Revenues were positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the third quarter of 2024 and had our Europe segment revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during the third quarter of 2023, we would have reported a revenue decline of 1.6 . Europe s segment revenues accounted for 39.6 and 40.4 of total segment revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the third quarter of 2024, the segment s operating profit increased 48.1 to 94.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, Europe s segment operating profit increased to 20.5 compared to 13.8 in the same period of the prior year. Segment operating profit as a percentage of revenues was positively impacted by higher utilization and government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense and foreign exchange rates.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Europe s segment revenues were 1,371.6 million, representing a decrease of 70.8 million, or 4.9 , from the same period last year. Europe s segment revenues accounted for 39.4 and 40.8 of total segment revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the segment s operating profit increased 11.2 to 209.9 million compared to the corresponding period of 2023. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, Europe s segment operating profit increased to 15.3 compared to 13.1 in the same period of the prior year. Segment operating profit was positively impacted by higher utilization and government incentives received related to conducting R D activities in Poland, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense and foreign exchange rates. 
 The following table presents Europe segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated:

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, Consumer Goods, Retail Travel remained the largest industry vertical in the Europe segment. However, revenues in this vertical declined 2.4 and 6.3 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily due to decreased demand from clients in the retail and consumer goods industries, partially offset by growth from our travel clients. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues in Financial Services grew 9.8 and 1.9 , respectively, primarily due to the improvement in demand from insurance and wealth management clients as well as from commercial banking clients in the third quarter of 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues in Business Information Media declined 33.8 and 31.2 , respectively, primarily due to decreased demand from two clients who were historically included in our top-10 clients. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues in Software Hi-Tech grew 25.0 and 10.9 , respectively, primarily due to the expansion of services provided to one of our top 10 clients. Revenues in Life Sciences Healthcare grew 43.1 and 35.2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to the growth experienced from clients in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Revenues in Emerging Verticals increased 0.4 and 0.2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, with growth experienced from clients in the energy industry as well as a client that was previously reported under the Russia segment. 
 
 Russia Segment 
 On July 26, 2023, we completed the sale of our remaining holdings in Russia to a third party. As a result of this sale, we no longer have operations associated with this segment. 

Effects of Inflation 
 Economies in many countries where we operate have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. Periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition to date. We continue to track the impact of inflation, particularly on wages, while attempting to minimize its effects through pricing and cost management strategies. A higher-than-normal rate of inflation in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, including those related to inflation, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations, to repurchase shares and make investments to support the growth of our business. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 2.036 billion, short-term investments totaling 22.3 million as well as 675.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 8 Debt of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) for information regarding our debt. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities 428,909 391,265 Net cash used in investing activities (39,100) (46,071) Net cash used in financing activities (391,667) (143,417) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (543) (5,632) Net (decrease)/increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (2,401) 196,145 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 2,043,108 1,683,636 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 2,040,707 1,879,781 
 Operating Activities 
 Our largest source of cash provided by operating activities is cash generated from our professional services that we provide to our clients. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include compensation to our employees and related costs, payments for leased facilities, various general corporate expenditures and income tax payments. Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, our operating activities included using cash on humanitarian efforts for Ukraine and geographic repositioning of our workforce. The first nine months of 2024 were positively impacted by lower payments for variable compensation as compared to the first nine months of 2023, attributable to a lower level of financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our primary uses of cash in investing activities consist of purchases of computer hardware, software and office equipment, as well as investments into office buildings and new businesses. We also use cash for short-term investments and time deposits and receive cash upon maturity of these deposits. Most of our investments are typically short-term and cash equivalent in nature but we may invest in longer term deposits if the terms are favorable. The cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to 57.1 million used for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, and 16.4 million used for capital expenditures compared to 14.0 million used for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, 18.4 million used for capital expenditures and an investment of 10.9 million in time deposits during the same period in 2023. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we received 41.5 million from matured investments in time deposits, compared to 10.9 million received during the same period in 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities mainly consists of repurchasing shares of EPAM common stock under the 2023 Repurchase Program and 2024 Repurchase Program, payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, repayments of debt, and settlements of the acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions of businesses. Cash provided by financing activities mainly consists of the proceeds from the purchases of shares under our ESPP and exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans as well as proceeds from debt. We typically do not rely on debt to supplement our cash flows. During the first nine months of 2024, our main use of cash in financing activities consisted of 385.0 million of payments to repurchase our common stock, compared to 128.4 million in the corresponding period of 2023. In addition, we used cash for the payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units of 32.5 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 28.2 million paid in the corresponding period of 2023. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash received from the exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans and proceeds from the purchase of shares under our ESPP of 33.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 28.6 million received in the corresponding period of 2023. 
 
 Future Capital Requirements 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with our expected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. However, the invasion of Ukraine, other various geopolitical events, and the related measures to contain their impact have caused and may continue to cause material disruptions in financial markets and economies. These disruptions may increase our costs of capital, decrease returns on investment, and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors including the impact of the invasion of Ukraine, as described elsewhere in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. To the extent that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and operating cash flows are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. If we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business and there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing.

 Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 
 We do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited). We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily result from changes in concentration of credit risks, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In addition, our global operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions, civil unrest, political instability or uncertainty, military activities, broad-based sanctions, differing tax structures, and other regulations and restrictions. 
 
 Concentration of Credit and Other Credit Risks 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and trade receivables. 
 We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with financial institutions. We believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk. We do not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. 
 We have cash in several countries, including Ukraine and Belarus, where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability; banking and other financial systems in these countries generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets, and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured. As of September 30, 2024, we had 63.6 million of cash and cash equivalents in banks in Ukraine and 29.3 million of cash and cash equivalents in banks in Belarus. We regularly monitor cash held in these countries and, to the extent the cash held exceeds amounts required to support our operations in these countries, we distribute the excess funds into markets with more developed banking sectors to the extent it is possible to do so. In April 2024, Belarus instituted new restrictions on distributing dividends from Belarus to shareholders in certain countries, including the U.S. The restrictions are initially scheduled to remain in place until the end of 2025 and may prevent EPAM from distributing excess funds, if any, out of Belarus. The Company does not expect these new restrictions to have a material impact on our ability to meet our worldwide cash obligations during this period. We place our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions considered stable in the region, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. However, a banking crisis, bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds, or sanctions may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Table of Contents 

 Trade receivables are generally dispersed across many clients operating in different industries; therefore, concentration of credit risk is limited and we do not believe significant credit risk existed as of September 30, 2024. Though our results of operations depend on our ability to successfully collect payment from our clients for work performed, historically, credit losses and write-offs of trade receivables have not been material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. If our clients enter bankruptcy protection or otherwise take steps to alleviate their financial distress, our credit losses and write-offs of trade receivables could increase, which would negatively impact our results of operations. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from variable rates related to cash and cash equivalent deposits, short-term investments, and our borrowings, mainly under our 2021 Credit Agreement, which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the currency and timing of funds borrowed. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to these deposits, investments and borrowings. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Our global operations are conducted predominantly in U.S. dollars. Other than U.S. dollars, we generate revenues principally in euros, British pounds, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars and incur expenditures principally in euros, Indian rupees, Polish zlotys, British pounds, Swiss francs, Hungarian forints, Mexican pesos, Colombian pesos, Canadian dollars, Armenian drams and Chinese yuan renminbi. As a result, exchange rate fluctuations in any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could negatively impact our results of operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 33.3 of consolidated revenues and 55.1 of consolidated operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 To manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, we implemented a hedging program through which we enter into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts with durations of twelve months or less that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted Polish zloty, Indian rupee, Hungarian forint and Mexican peso transactions. As of September 30, 2024, all of EPAM s foreign exchange forward contracts, were designated as hedges and there is no financial collateral (including cash collateral) required to be posted related to the foreign exchange forward contracts. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, foreign exchange loss was 0.7 million compared to a gain of 3.9 million reported in the corresponding period last year. Foreign exchange loss was primarily driven by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies on our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate movements can impact the reported value of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded. 
 Management supplements results reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicated internally and externally, for managing our business and evaluating its performance. When important to management s analysis, operating results are compared on the basis of constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we reported revenue growth of 1.3 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Had our consolidated revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during the third quarter of 2023, we would have reported revenue growth of 0.9 . Our revenues denominated in the British pound, euro and Swiss franc experienced the most impact from the movements in foreign currencies. During the third quarter of 2024, we reported an increase in income from operations of 55.2 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Had our consolidated results been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during the third quarter of 2023, we would have reported an increase in income from operations of 56.1 . Income from operations was most significantly impacted by the movements of Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, British pound and Mexican peso exchange rates during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on management s evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, these officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
