In an effort to make informed decisions, we utilize credit ratings that express opinions about the credit quality of a security. Securities are triggered for further review in the quarter if the security has significant fluctuations in ratings, significant pricing changes, or drops below investment-grade. For securities without credit ratings, we utilize other financial information indicating the financial health of the underlying municipality, agency, or organization associated with the underlying security. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we carried allowance on available for sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available for sale securities segregated by contractual maturity at September 30, 2024 are presented below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are shown in total, as their maturities are highly variable.

 Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations: US Government-sponsored enterprises US Government agency Private label Obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof Corporate bonds Total securities available for sale We expect to recover the amortized cost basis on all securities in our AFS portfolio. Furthermore, we do not intend to sell nor do we anticipate that we will be required to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, prior to this recovery. Our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery is supported by our capital and liquidity positions as well as historically low portfolio turnover. The following summarizes, by investment security type, the impact of securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024: Obligations of US Government-sponsored enterprises out of the total securities in our portfolio of AFS obligations of US Government-sponsored enterprises were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of securities in unrealized loss positions.

Obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof of the total securities in our portfolio of AFS municipal bonds and obligations were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of securities in unrealized loss positions. We continually monitor the municipal bond sector of the market carefully and periodically evaluate the appropriate level of exposure to the market. At this time, we believe (i) the bonds in this portfolio carry minimal risk of default and (ii) we are appropriately compensated for the risk. There were no material underlying credit downgrades during the quarter. Corporate bonds out of the total securities in our portfolio of AFS corporate bonds were in an unrealized loss position. The aggregate unrealized loss represents of the amortized cost of bonds in unrealized loss positions. We review the financial strength of all of these bonds, and we have concluded that the amortized cost remains supported by the expected future cash flows of these securities. The most recent review includes all bond issuers and their current credit ratings, financial performance and capitalization.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable for loans totaled million and million, respectively, and is included in the other assets line item on the consolidated balance sheets. Characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows: Commercial construction - Loans in this segment primarily include raw land, land development and construction of commercial and multifamily residential properties. Collateral values are determined based upon appraisals and evaluations of the completed structure in accordance with established policy guidelines. Maximum loan-to-value ratios at origination are governed by established policy guidelines that are more restrictive than on stabilized commercial real estate transactions. Construction loans are primarily paid by the cash flow generated from the completed structure, such as operating leases, rents, or other operating cash flows from the borrower. Commercial real estate owner occupied and non-owner occupied - Loans in these segments are primarily owner-occupied or income-producing properties. Loans to real estate investment trusts and unsecured loans to developers that closely correlate to the inherent risk in commercial real estate markets are also included. Commercial real estate loans are typically written with amortizing payment structures. Collateral values are determined based upon appraisals and evaluations in accordance with established policy guidelines. Maximum loan-to-value ratios at origination are governed by established policy and regulatory guidelines. Commercial real estate loans are primarily paid by the cash flow generated from the real property, such as operating leases, rents, or other operating cash flows from the borrower. Tax Exempt - Loans in this segment primarily include loans to various state and municipal government entities. Loans made to these borrowers may provide us with tax-exempt income. While governed and underwritten similar to commercial loans they do have unique requirements based on established polices. Almost all state and municipal loans are considered a general obligation of the issuing entity. Given the size of many municipal borrowers, borrowings are normally not rated by major rating agencies.

The activity in the ACL on unfunded commitments for the periods ended was as follows: Provision for credit losses ) ) Ending Balance Loan Origination/Risk Management: We have certain lending policies and procedures in place designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Our Board of Directors reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management and the Board of Directors with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, and concentration of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans and potential problem loans. We seek to diversify the loan portfolio as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Credit Quality Indicators: In monitoring the credit quality of the portfolio, management applies a credit quality indicator and uses an internal risk rating system to categorize commercial loans. These credit quality indicators range from one through nine, with a higher number correlating to increasing risk of loss. Consistent with regulatory guidelines, the Company provides for the classification of loans which are considered to be of lesser quality as special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss (i.e. risk-rated 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively). The following are the definitions of our credit quality indicators: Pass: Loans we consider in the commercial portfolio segments that are not adversely rated, are contractually current as to principal and interest, and are otherwise in compliance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management believes there is a low risk of loss related to these loans considered pass-rated. Special Mention: Loans considered having some potential weaknesses, but are deemed to not carry levels of risk inherent in one of the subsequent categories, are designated as special mention. A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. This might include loans which may require a higher level of supervision or internal reporting because of: (i) declining industry trends; (ii) increasing reliance on secondary sources of repayment; (iii) the poor condition of or lack of control over collateral; or (iv) failure to obtain proper documentation or any other deviations from prudent lending practices. Economic or market conditions which may, in the future, affect the obligor may warrant special mention of the asset. Loans for which an adverse trend in the borrower's operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet which has not reached a point

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold million and million, respectively, of residential mortgage loans on the secondary market, which resulted in a net gain on sale of loans (net of costs, including direct and indirect origination costs) of thousand and thousand, respectively. We sell residential loans on the secondary market while primarily retaining the servicing of these loans. Servicing sold loans helps to maintain customer relationships and earn fees over the servicing period. Loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The risks inherent in servicing assets relate primarily to level of prepayments that result from shifts in interest rates. We obtain third-party valuations of our servicing assets portfolio quarterly, and the assumptions are reflected in Fair Value disclosures.

During the third quarter of 2024, we prepaid million of our existing advance. The BTFP was an additional source of liquidity with favorable prepayment terms, as we may prepay at any time without penalty.

 million of subordinated notes (the Notes to accredited investors on November 19, 2019. The Notes have a maturity date of December 1, 2029 and bear a fixed interest rate of through December 1, 2024 payable semi-annually in arrears. From December 1, 2024 and thereafter the interest rate shall be reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus . We have the option beginning with the interest payment date of December 1, 2024, and on any scheduled payment date thereafter, to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part upon prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The transaction included debt issuance costs of thousand as of September 30, 2024 and thousand net of amortization as of December 31, 2023, which are netted against the subordinated debt. On September 27, 2024, we notified the trustee of the Notes that we had exercised our option to partially redeem an aggregate million of the Notes, effective December 1, 2024. We also have million in floating Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Debentures issued by NHTB Capital Trust II Trust II and NHTB Capital Trust III Trust III ), which are both Connecticut statutory trusts. The Debentures issued on March 30, 2004 carry a variable interest rate of three-month SOFR plus , and mature in 2034. The debt is callable by the Company at the time when any interest payment is made. Trust II and Trust III are considered variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, Trust II and Trust III are not consolidated into our financial statements. Repurchase Agreements We can raise additional liquidity by entering into repurchase agreements at our discretion. In a security repurchase agreement transaction, we will generally sell a security, agreeing to repurchase either the same or substantially identical security on a specified later date, at a greater price than the original sales price. The difference between the sale price and purchase price is the cost of the proceeds, which is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. The securities underlying the agreements are delivered to counterparties as security for the repurchase obligations. Since the securities are treated as collateral and the agreement does not qualify for a full transfer of effective control, the transactions do not meet the criteria to be classified as sales, and are therefore considered secured borrowing transactions for accounting purposes. Payments on such borrowings are interest only until the scheduled repurchase date. In a repurchase agreement, we are subject to the risk that the purchaser may default at maturity and not return the securities underlying the agreements. In order to minimize this potential risk, we either deal with established firms when entering into these transactions or with customers whose agreements stipulate that the securities underlying the agreement are not delivered to the customer and instead are held in segregated safekeeping accounts by our safekeeping agents.

 The effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: ) Non-hedging derivatives: Interest rate lock commitments Mortgage banking income ) Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps on wholesale funding As of September 30, 2024, we have interest rate swaps on wholesale borrowings to limit our exposure to rising interest rates over a term on 3-month FHLB borrowings or brokered certificates, or a combination thereof at each maturity date. The first of the agreements was entered into in November 2019 with a million notional amount and pays a fixed interest rate of . A second agreement was entered into in April 2020 with a million notional amount and pays a fixed rate of . The financial institution counterparty pays us interest on the daily SOFR rate plus basis points. We designated the swaps as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swap on variable rate loans We have an interest rate swap that effectively fixes our interest rate on million at the daily SOFR rate plus basis points of based loan assets at plus the credit spread on the loans that reprices on a weighted average basis. The instrument is specifically designed to hedge the risk of changes in its cash flows from interest receipts attributable to changes in a contractually specified interest rate, on an amount of our variable rate loan assets equal to million. We designated the swap as a cash flow hedge. Fair value hedges Interest rate swap on securities For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We utilize interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the effect of changing interest rates on the fair values of fixed rate callable securities available-for-sale. The hedging strategy on securities converts the fixed interest rates to SOFR based variable interest rates. These derivatives are designated as partial term hedges of selected cash flows covering specified periods of time prior to the call dates of the hedged securities. During 2019, we entered into swap transactions with a notional amount of million designated as fair value hedges. These derivatives are intended to protect against the effects of changing interest rates on the fair values of fixed rate securities. The fixed rates on the transactions have a weighted average of . Economic hedges Forward sale commitments We utilize forward sale commitments on residential mortgage loans to hedge interest rate risk and the associated effects on the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and loans originated for sale. The forward sale commitments are accounted for as derivatives. We typically use a combination of best efforts and mandatory delivery contracts. The contracts are loan sale agreements where we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date. Generally, we enter into contracts just prior to the loan closing with a customer. Customer loan derivatives We enter into customer loan derivatives to facilitate the risk management strategies for commercial banking customers. We mitigate this risk by entering into equal and offsetting loan swap agreements with highly rated third-party financial

IRLCs relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans that are held for sale and are considered derivative financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance. Outstanding IRLCs expose us to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments may decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan. The IRLCs are free standing derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes recorded in non-interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of IRLCs subsequent to inception are based on (i) changes in the fair value of the underlying loan resulting from the fulfillment of the commitment and (ii) changes in the probability when the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment, which is affected primarily by changes in interest rates and the passage of time.

These fees are primarily earned over time as we charge our customers on a monthly or quarterly basis in accordance with investment advisory agreements. Fees are generally assessed based on a tiered scale of the average monthly market value of assets under management. Certain fees, such as bill paying fees, distribution fees, real estate sale fees, and supplemental tax service fees, are recorded as revenue at a point in time upon the completion of the service. Financial Services Fees Bar Harbor Financial Services is a branch office of Osaic Institutions, Inc.

 Other Liabilities The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in contract assets or receivables and contract liabilities or deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. For most customer contracts, fees are deducted directly from customer accounts and, therefore, there is no associated impact on the accounts receivable balance. For certain types of service contracts, we have an unconditional right to consideration under the service contract and an accounts receivable balance is recorded for services completed. When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue after control of the products or services is transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract We currently expense contract costs for processing and administrative fees for debit card transactions. We also expense custody fees and transactional costs associated with securities transactions as well as third-party tax preparation fees. We have elected the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4, whereby we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets we otherwise would have recognized is or less.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is management s discussion and analysis of the major factors that influenced our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K. The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections titled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q. All amounts, dollars and percentages presented in this Form 10-Q are rounded and therefore approximate. GENERAL The Company is a bank holding company headquartered in Maine, providing a broad array of banking and nonbanking products and services to businesses and consumers primarily within our three-state footprint. The Company's primary sources of revenue, through the Bank, are net interest income (predominantly from loans and investment securities) and noninterest income (principally fees and other revenue from financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits). Liquidity remains strong, with cash and available for sale securities representing approximately 15.3 of our total assets at September 30, 2024. We maintain the ability to access sources of contingent liquidity at the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (the Reserve Bank ). We consider the Company's current liquidity position to be adequate to meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Refer to Liquidity and Cash Flows for additional information. Capital remains strong, with both the Company and the Bank well capitalized under regulatory guidelines at period end as further described in Note 6 Capital Ratios and Shareholders Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Asset quality remains solid, with non-performing assets to total assets of 0.18 as of September 30, 2024 and net charge-offs of 60 thousand, reflecting our strong credit performance in the midst of a challenging environment. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the financial services industry. However, we also evaluate our performance by reference to certain additional financial measures discussed in this Form 10-Q that we identify as being non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both. 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Form 10-Q should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Form 10-Q may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Form 10-Q when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE SUMMARY Earnings (third quarter 2024, compared to the same period of 2023) GAAP and core (Non-GAAP) net income of 12.2 million or 0.80 per diluted share compared to GAAP and core (Non-GAAP) net income of 11.1 million or 0.73 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2023. Return on assets was 1.20 versus 1.11 and return on equity was 10.68 compared to 10.72 . Return on average assets was higher due to higher net income and average asset balances. The decrease in the return on equity ratio reflected higher average asset and equity balances. See the Financial Position section for further discussion. Net interest income was 29.0 million compared to 29.2 million and net interest margin NIM was 3.15 , versus 3.18 . The decrease was primarily driven by higher cost of funds partially offset by yield expansion on earnings assets. The provision for credit losses was 228 thousand compared to 673 thousand in the third quarter 2023 as net charge-offs remain stable and minimal and credit quality continues to remain strong.

Commercial loans grew 1 primarily driven by a 42.7 million, or 10 annualized increase in commercial real estate partially offset by a 38.7 million, or 37 annualized, decrease in commercial and industrial loans driven by paydowns, payoffs and a mix shift to tax exempt and other. Residential real estate decreased by 18.2 million, or 8 annualized, compared to the second quarter 2024, as we focus on growing the portfolio with higher yielding commercial loans. Consumer loans increased 3.7 million, or 15 annualized, driven by continued growth in home equity line originations and drawdowns on established lines in the third quarter 2024. The allowance for credit losses continued to build, standing at 29.0 million at the end of the third quarter 2024 compared to 28.9 million at the end of the second quarter 2024.

The decrease was primarily driven by a higher cost of funds on deposits partially offset by lower borrowing costs and increased interest and dividend income from rising asset yields in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest and Dividend Income Total interest and dividend income in the third quarter 2024 increased by 3.5 million or 7.6 to 48.6 million compared to 45.1 million in the third quarter 2023 primarily driven by the repricing of adjustable loans and originations of higher fixed rate loans within the commercial portfolio.

Borrowings costs decreased 3.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 driven by lower borrowing levels and decrease in yields to 4.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.6 for the same period ended 2023. The decrease in both periods was primarily driven by higher cost of funds partially offset by lower borrowing costs. Competitive pricing within the interest rate environment and a 158.9 million growth in total deposits driven in time deposits year-over-year partially offset by mix change between interest-bearing and non-interest bearing demand deposits. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses in the third quarter 2024 was 228 thousand compared to 673 thousand in the third quarter 2023 as net charge-offs to total loans continue to remain nominal. Non-accruing loans to total loans remained flat at 0.23 at the end of the third quarter 2024 compared the third quarter 2023. The provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 million lower than the prior year at 1.1 million compared to 2.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase ACL balance in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to loan growth; however, the ratio of ACL to total loans has remained stable at 0.94 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by more refined

Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense was 24.8 million in the third quarter 2024 compared to 22.8 million in the third quarter 2023 driven by salary and benefits, and other expenses. Salary and benefit expenses increased 10.5 , or 1.4 million, from the third quarter 2023 driven in part by stock compensation due to a 7.21 per share increase in stock price and a lower discount on postretirement liabilities year over year. Other expenses increased to 4.2 million from 3.7 million in the third quarter 2023 primarily due to increases in media relations expenses, software expenses, and debit and ATM card expenses.

Liquidity and Cash Flows Liquidity is measured by our ability to meet short-term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimal loss. We seek to obtain favorable sources of liabilities and to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands. Besides serving as a funding source for maturing obligations, liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer-initiated needs. Many factors affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, including variations in the markets served by our network of offices, mix of assets and liabilities, reputation and credit standing in the marketplace, and general economic conditions. The Bank actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios established under its Asset-Liability Management Policy. Continual monitoring of these ratios, by using historical data and through forecasts under multiple rate and stress scenarios, allows the Bank to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity. The Bank's policy is to maintain a liquidity position of at least 8 of total assets. A portion of the Bank s deposit base has been historically seasonal in nature, with balances typically declining in the winter months through late spring, during which period the Bank s liquidity position tightens.

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, available same-day liquidity totaled approximately 1.1 billion, including cash, borrowing capacity at FHLB and the Federal Reserve Discount Window and various lines of credit. Additional sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, wholesale deposits, cash flow from our amortizing securities and loan portfolios. As of September 30, 2024, we had unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB of 475.1 million, unused borrowing capacity at the Reserve Bank of 87.0 million and unused lines of credit totaling 41.0 million, in addition to 101.8 million in cash. The Bank maintains a liquidity contingency plan approved by the Bank s Board of Directors. This plan addresses the steps that would be taken in the event of a liquidity crisis, and identifies other sources of liquidity available to us. Our management believes the level of liquidity is sufficient to meet current and future funding requirements. However, changes in economic conditions, including consumer savings habits and availability or access to the brokered deposit market could potentially have a significant impact on our liquidity position. Capital Resources Please refer to Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 - Equity for a discussion of shareholders equity together with Note 6 - Capital Ratios and Shareholders Equity in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Additional information about regulatory capital is contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in our most recent Form 10-K. We expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends with respect to our common stock subject to our Board of Directors discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. We believe our quarterly dividend rate per share as approved by our Board of Directors, enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing our business and returning a portion of our earnings to our shareholders. Historically, and a practice we intend to continue, our principal cash expenditure is the payment of dividends on our common stock, if as and when declared by our Board of Directors. Dividends were paid to our shareholders in the aggregate amount of 13.3 million and 12.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All dividends declared and distributed by us will be in compliance with applicable state corporate law and regulatory requirements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are, from time to time, a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, that may be material to investors. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to standby letters of credit whereby the Bank guarantees the obligations or performance of certain customers. These letters of credit are sometimes issued in support of third-party debt. The risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers, and such letters of credit are subject to the same origination, portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit products. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon issuance of a standby letter of credit, is based upon management's credit evaluation of the customer. Our off-balance sheet arrangements have not changed materially since previously reported in our Form 10-K. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Please refer to Note 1 Basis of Presentation - Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements to our Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements to our Form 10-K. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management

Table of Contents 
 to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in the section titled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in our Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our application of critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates/prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The most significant market risk that affects us is interest rate risk. Other types of market risk do not arise in the normal course of our business activities. The responsibility for interest rate risk management oversight is the function of the Bank s Asset and Liability Committee, or ALCO, chaired by the Bank s Chief Financial Officer and composed of various members of the Bank s senior management. ALCO meets regularly to review balance sheet structure, formulate strategies in light of current and expected economic conditions, adjust product prices as necessary, implement policy, monitor liquidity, and review performance against guidelines established to control exposure to the various types of inherent risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on the Bank's net interest income. Interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re-pricing, maturity and/or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities. Management s objectives are to measure, monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in the Bank s balance sheet. The objectives in managing the Bank's balance sheet are to preserve the sensitivity of net interest income to actual or potential changes in interest rates, and to enhance profitability through strategies that promote sufficient reward for understood and controlled risk. The Bank s interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re-pricing and cash flow attributes of balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments as each relate to current and potential changes in interest rates. The level of interest rate risk, measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income, is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios. Interest rate risk is evaluated in depth on a quarterly basis and reviewed by ALCO and the Bank s Board of Directors. The Bank's Asset Liability Management Policy, approved annually by the Bank s Board of Directors, establishes interest rate risk limits in terms of variability of net interest income under rising, flat, and decreasing rate scenarios. It is the role of the ALCO to evaluate the overall risk profile and to determine actions to maintain and achieve a posture consistent with policy guidelines. Interest Rate Sensitivity Modeling: The Bank utilizes an interest rate risk model widely recognized in the financial industry to monitor and measure interest rate risk. The model simulates the behavior of interest income and expense for all balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments, under different interest rate scenarios together with a dynamic future balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured in terms of potential changes in net interest income based upon shifts in the yield curve. The interest rate risk sensitivity model requires that assets and liabilities be broken down into components as to fixed, variable, and adjustable interest rates, as well as other homogeneous groupings, which are segregated as to maturity and type of instrument. The model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time and in different interest rate environments. The model uses contractual re-pricing dates for variable products, contractual maturities for fixed rate products, and product-specific assumptions for deposit accounts, such as money market accounts, that are subject to re-pricing based on current market conditions. Re-pricing margins are also determined for adjustable rate assets and incorporated in the model. Investment securities and borrowings with option provisions are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of exercise. Prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans are calibrated using specific Bank experience while mortgage-backed securities are developed from industry standard models of prepayment speeds, based upon similar coupon ranges and degree of seasoning. Cash flows and maturities are then determined, and for certain assets, prepayment assumptions are estimated under different interest rate scenarios. Interest income and interest expense are then simulated under several hypothetical interest rate conditions. The simulation models a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a 12-month period. Using this approach, we are able to produce simulation results that illustrate the effect that both a gradual rate ramp and a rate shock have on earnings

Table of Contents 
 expectations. Our net interest income sensitivity analysis reflects changes to net interest income assuming no balance sheet growth and a parallel shift in interest rates. All rate changes were ramped over the first 12-month period and then maintained at those levels over the remainder of the simulation horizon. Changes in net interest income based upon these simulations are measured against the flat interest rate scenario. As of September 30, 2024, interest rate sensitivity modeling results indicate that the Bank s balance sheet was asset sensitive over the one- and two-year horizons. The following table presents the changes in sensitivities on net interest income for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Change in Interest Rates-Basis Points (Rate Ramp) 1 - 12 Months 13 - 24 Months (in thousands, except ratios) Change Change Change Change At September 30, 2024 -200 (5,070) (4.1) (13,418) (9.9) -100 (2,875) (2.3) (6,555) (4.8) +100 2,899 2.4 5,873 4.3 +200 5,162 4.2 10,758 7.9 At September 30, 2023 -200 (4,125) (3.2) (10,532) (7.6) -100 (1,359) (1.1) (4,201) (3.0) +100 1,247 1.0 2,660 1.9 +200 2,314 1.8 4,575 3.3 Assuming short-term and long-term interest rates decline 200 basis points from current levels (i.e., a parallel yield curve shift) over the next twelve months and the Bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels, management believes net interest income will deteriorate over the one year horizon while deteriorating further from that level over the two-year horizon. Assuming short-term and long-term interest rates increase 200 basis points from current levels (i.e., a parallel yield curve shift) over the next twelve months and the Bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels, management believes net interest income will improve over the one year horizon while improving further from that level over the two-year horizon. As compared to September 30, 2023, asset sensitivity has increased in both year one and year two. The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shape, prepayment speeds on loans and securities, deposit rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and renegotiated loan terms with borrowers. While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. As market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results may also differ due to: prepayment and refinancing levels deviating from those assumed; the impact of interest rate changes, caps or floors on adjustable rate assets; the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans; depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes; and other such variables. The sensitivity analysis also does not reflect additional actions that the Bank s Senior Executive Team and Board of Directors might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates, and the anticipated impact on the Bank s net interest income.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Disclosure controls and procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, consisting of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by using our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We and our subsidiari es are parties to certain ordinary routine litigation incidental to the normal conduct of their respective businesses. Although the Company is not able to predict the outcome of such actions, at this time, in the opinion of management, the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position as a whole. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We believe there were no material changes to the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Form 10-K.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS No unregistered equity securities were sold by the Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. On April 18, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a 12-month plan to repurchase up to 5 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, representing approximately 761,000 shares. No shares were repurchased by the Company in the first nine months of 2024 and the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan is 761,000 shares. We will continue examine buying opportunities considering market conditions, including interest rate volatility and potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company any "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" as such terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
