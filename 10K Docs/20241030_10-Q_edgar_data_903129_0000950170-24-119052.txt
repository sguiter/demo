The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement matures on . The U.S. borrowers and guarantors participating in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also entered into a Second Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement ).

In addition to the security obligations, all obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (including all obligations of any U.S. or non-U.S. loan party) are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of Gentherm s domestic subsidiaries, and the German subsidiary borrowers and certain other foreign subsidiaries guarantee all obligations of the non-U.S. loan parties under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, (i) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing four fiscal quarters) as of the end of any fiscal quarter.

vehicles from model years 2015-2020 to remedy an alleged problem with a suction jet pump seal inside the fuel tank system. VW informed Gentherm of its plan to conduct the recall on April 3, 2024. The suction jet pump is a product originally designed and manufactured by Alfmeier, the business Gentherm acquired in August 2022. The Company has not accepted any financial responsibility for the recall and intends to provide replacement parts for the recall at commercial pricing paid by VW. The Company is pursuing discussions with VW to advance its position and resolve this matter. No litigation has been threatened or filed as of the date of this report. If the Company is obligated to indemnify VW for the direct and indirect costs associated with the recall, such costs could be material. The Company has insurance policies that generally include coverage of the costs of a recall, subject to insured limits, although the Company s costs related to manufacturing of replacement parts are generally not covered. In addition, the Company s purchase agreement of Alfmeier includes indemnification provisions under which the Company believes it would have a claim against the sellers. Given the uncertainty that exists concerning the resolution of this matter, as of the date of this report, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount and timing of possible costs that may be incurred by the Company.

The Company did t incur any hedge ineffectiveness during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Accounts Receivable Factoring The Company sells certain customer trade receivables on a non-recourse basis under factoring arrangements with designated financial institutions. The sale of receivables under these agreements is considered an off-balance sheet arrangement to the Company and is accounted for as a true sale and excluded from accounts receivable in the consolidated condensed balance sheets. These factoring arrangements include a deferred purchase price component in which a portion of the purchase price for the receivable is paid by the financial institution in cash upon sale and the remaining portion is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable and paid at a later date. Deferred purchase price receivables are recorded in other current assets within the consolidated condensed balance sheets. Cash proceeds received upon the sale of the receivables are included in net cash provided by operating activities and the cash proceeds received on the deferred purchase price receivables are included in net cash used in investing activities. All factoring arrangements incorporate customary representations, including representations as to validity of amounts due, completeness of performance obligations and absence of commercial disputes.

material financial assets and liabilities that were carried at fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and also considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As these nonrecurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company utilized a third-party to assist in the Level 3 fair value estimates of other intangible assets for acquisitions and goodwill of the Medical reporting unit. The estimated fair values of these assets were based on third-party valuations and management s estimates, generally utilizing income and market approaches. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , there were other significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Items Not Carried at Fair Value The Company uses an income valuation technique to measure the fair values of its debt instruments by converting amounts of future cash flows to a single present value amount using rates based on current market expectations (Level 2 inputs). As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , the carrying values of the indebtedness under the Company s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were not materially different than the estimated fair values because the interest rates on variable rate debt approximated rates currently available to the Company (see Note 6).

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Overview 
 Gentherm Incorporated is the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry and a leader in medical patient temperature management. Automotive products include variable temperature Climate Control Seats , heated automotive interior systems (including heated seats, steering wheels, armrests and other components), battery performance solutions, cable systems, lumbar and massage comfort solutions, fuel management valves and other valves for brake and engine systems, and other electronic devices. Our automotive products can be found on vehicles manufactured by nearly all the major original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") operating in North America and Europe, and several major OEMs in Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. Medical products include patient temperature management systems. Our medical products can be found in hospitals throughout the world, primarily in the U.S., China, Germany and Brazil. The Company is also developing a number of new technologies and products that will help enable improvements to existing products, improve health, wellness and patient outcomes and will lead to new product applications for existing and new and adjacent markets. 
 Our Automotive sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the OEMs, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, our product content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. Historically, new vehicle demand and product content (i.e. vehicle features) have been driven by macroeconomic and other factors, such as interest rates, automotive manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. Vehicle content has also been driven by trends in consumer preferences, such as preferences for smart devices and features, personalized user experience, and comfort, health and wellness. Economic volatility or weakness in North America, Europe or Asia, as well as global geopolitical factors, have had and could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which have had and would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe our diversified OEM customer base and 
 24 

geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns in the ordinary course. However, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles that contain less of our product content as well as continuing production challenges and inflationary pressures have adversely impacted our profitability and may continue to do so. In addition, we have been and may in the future be adversely impacted by volatility or weakness in markets for hybrid or electric vehicles specifically. We believe our products offer certain advantages for hybrid and electric vehicles, including improved energy efficiency, and position us well to withstand changes in the volume mix between vehicles driven by internal combustion engines and hybrid and other electric vehicles. We believe our industry is increasingly progressing towards a focus on human comfort and health and wellness, which is evidenced by increasing adoption rates for comfort products. We believe that products we are developing, such as ClimateSense , WellSense , and our acquisition of Alfmeier Pr zision SE Alfmeier pneumatic comfort solutions, position us well to address trends in consumer preferences such as personalized user experience, comfort, health and wellness. Gentherm is an independent partner that can cooperate with any combination of the vehicle OEMs and seat manufacturers globally, including those that are vertically integrated, to create innovative and unique configurations that adapt to industry trends. 
 Recent Trends 
 Global Conditions 
 Since 2020, the global economy has experienced significant volatility and supply chain disruption, which has had a widespread adverse effect on the global automotive industry. These macroeconomic conditions have resulted in fluctuating demand and production disruptions, facility closures, labor shortages and work stoppages. In addition, global inflation has increased significantly beginning in 2021. Although supply chain conditions have steadily improved and certain inflationary pressures have moderated, rising costs of materials, labor, equipment and other inputs used to manufacture and sell our products, including freight and logistics costs, have impacted, and may in the future impact, operating costs and operating results. We continue to employ measures to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies where possible. However, we have been unable to fully mitigate or pass through the increases in our operating costs, which may continue in the future. 
 We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition. 
 We have a global manufacturing footprint that enables us to serve our customers in the regions they operate and shift production between regions to remain competitive. In recent years there have been various ongoing geopolitical conflicts, such as the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, and in the Middle East, heightened tensions in the Red Sea, and potential tensions in the South China Sea. These conflicts have interrupted ocean freight shipping and if prolonged or intensified, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We, like other manufacturers, have a high proportion of fixed structural costs, and therefore relatively small changes in industry vehicle production have and may continue to have a substantial effect on our financial results. If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. 
 On December 15, 2022, the European Union EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two Framework. The effective dates for different aspects of the directive are January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. The aspects of the directive that were effective as of January 1, 2024 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. Further, the Company does not expect the remaining aspects to have a material impact to the Company s financial statements. The Company will continue to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of these tax regulations. 
 Fit-for-Growth 2.0 
 During the first half of 2023, the Company launched Fit-for-Growth 2.0 to execute as part of our long-term growth strategy. Fit-for-Growth 2.0 has begun, and is expected to continue, to deliver significant cost reductions through sourcing excellence, value engineering, manufacturing productivity, manufacturing footprint optimization, product profitability and cost synergies from the Alfmeier acquisition. Additionally, the program is intended to drive operating expense efficiency to leverage scale. 
 25 

2023 Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization 
 On September 19, 2023, the Company committed to a restructuring plan 2023 Plan to improve the Company s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this 2023 Plan, the Company will relocate certain existing manufacturing and related activities in its Greenville, South Carolina facility to a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the sale of our Greenville, South Carolina manufacturing facility, resulting in a gain on sale of 1.7 million. The gain on sale was recorded as a reduction of restructuring expenses, net in the consolidated condensed statements of income. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized restructuring expense of 0.3 million and 1.8 million, respectively, for employee separation costs and 0.2 million and 0.6 million, respectively, for other costs, including the gain on sale of the Greenville facility. 
 See Note 3, Restructuring, to the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements included in this Report for additional information related to this plan. 
 Light Vehicle Production Volumes 
 Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. According to the forecasting firm S P Global Mobility (October 2024 release), global light vehicle production in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the Company s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, are shown below (in millions of units):

The S P Global Mobility (October 2024 release) forecasted light vehicle production volume in the Company s key markets for full year 2024 to decrease to 73.9 million units, a 2.1 decrease from full year 2023 light vehicle production volumes. Forecasted light vehicle production volumes are a component of the data we use in forecasting future business. However, these forecasts generally are updated monthly, and future forecasts have been and may continue to be significantly different from period to period due to changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions or matters specific to the automotive industry. Further, due to differences in regional product mix at our manufacturing facilities, as well as material production schedules from our customers for our products on specific vehicle programs, our future forecasted results do not directly correlate with the global and/or regional light vehicle production forecasts of S P Global Mobility or other third-party sources. 
 Automotive New Business Awards 
 We believe that innovation is an important element to gaining market acceptance of our products and strengthening our market position. During the third quarter of 2024, we secured automotive new business awards totaling 600 million. Automotive new business awards represent the aggregate projected lifetime revenue of new awards provided by our customers to Gentherm in the applicable period, with the value based on the price and volume projections received from each customer as of the award date. Although automotive new business awards are not firm customer orders, we believe that automotive new business awards are an indicator of future revenue. Automotive new business awards are not projections of revenue or future business as of September 30, 2024, the date of this Report or any other date. Customer projections regularly change over time, and we do not update our calculation of any automotive new business award after the date initially communicated. Automotive new business awards in the third quarter 2024 also do not reflect, in particular, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges on future business. Revenues resulting from automotive new business awards also are subject to additional risks and uncertainties that are included in this Report or incorporated by reference in Forward-Looking Statements above. 
 26

These decreases were partially offset by higher automotive volumes, start-up costs from our new plants in Tangier, Morocco and Monterrey, Mexico and unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily attributable to the Euro and the Chinese Renminbi.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, operating lease payments, income tax payments and general corporate purposes. We generally reinvest available cash flows from operations into our business, while opportunistically utilizing our authorized stock repurchase program. Further, we continuously evaluate acquisition, disposition, exits, and investment opportunities that will enhance our business strategies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 150.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and 278.0 million of availability under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. However, there can be no assurance equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current shareholders. 
 We continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies and the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Gentherm Incorporated. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled 109.0 million. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; however, based on our current liquidity needs and strategies, we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts. 
 We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, borrowings available under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.

Credit Agreement 
 Gentherm, together with certain of its subsidiaries, maintain a revolving credit note (the Revolving Credit Facility under its Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was entered into on June 10, 2022 and amended and restated in its entirety the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated June 27, 2019, by and among Gentherm, certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and the Agent. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has a maximum borrowing capacity of 500 million and matures on June 10, 2027. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, (i) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing four fiscal quarters) as of the end of any fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance, in all material respects, with the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 Finance Leases 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 0.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of outstanding finance leases. 
 35 

Other Sources of Liquidity 
 The Company was party to receivable factoring agreements with unrelated third parties under which we could sell receivables for certain account debtors, on a revolving basis, subject to outstanding balances and concentration limits. The receivable factoring agreements are transferred in their entirety to the acquiring entities and are accounted for as a sale. Some of the agreements have deferred purchase price arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, there was no availability for new factoring under the receivable factoring agreements as the factoring agreements the Company was party to either expired or were terminated during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 In September 2023, the Company committed to a restructuring plan to improve the Company s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. The Company expects to incur less than 1.0 million of additional restructuring costs for the 2023 Plan. See Note 3, Restructuring, to the consolidated condensed financial statements included in this Report for additional information related to this plan. 
 Except as described above, there have been no material changes in our cash requirements since December 31, 2023, the end of fiscal year 2023. See Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding our material cash requirements. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 The automotive component supply industry has historically been subject to inflationary pressures with respect to materials and labor. Since 2021, the automotive industry has experienced a period of significant volatility in the costs of certain materials and components, labor and transportation. Although supply chain conditions have steadily improved and certain inflationary pressures have moderated, rising costs of materials, labor, equipment and other inputs used to manufacture and sell our products, including freight and logistics costs, have impacted, and may in the future impact, operating costs and operating results. These higher costs and cost increases due to inflation are expected to continue for the foreseeable future as demand remains elevated and supply remains constrained. Although the Company has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher material component costs and transportation costs through sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies where possible, these strategies together with commercial negotiations with Gentherm's customers and suppliers have not fully offset to date and may not fully offset our future cost increases. Such inflationary cost increase may increase the cash required to fund our operations by a material amount. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies or critical accounting estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We are not presently aware of any events or circumstances that would require us to update our estimates, assumptions or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change, however, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. As a result, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is exposed to various market risks including, but not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities such as copper. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the Company's debt obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, acquisitions denominated in foreign currencies, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, North Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won, Czech Koruna and Vietnamese Dong. 
 The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The decision of whether and when to execute derivative financial instruments, along with the duration of the instrument, may vary from period to period depending on market conditions, the relative costs of the instruments and capacity to hedge. The duration is linked to the timing of the underlying exposure, with the connection between the two being regularly monitored. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Some derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting; for other derivative contracts, we elect to not apply hedge accounting. 
 The Company s designated hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts that can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated condensed balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated condensed statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Company records the ineffective portion of foreign currency and copper commodity hedging instruments, if any, to cost of sales, and the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps, if any, to interest expense, net in the consolidated condensed statements of income. Cash flows associated with derivatives are reported in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows. 
 Information related to the fair values of all derivative instruments in the consolidated condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 is set forth in Note 10, Financial Instruments in the consolidated condensed financial statements included in this Report. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for each of the Company s debt obligations, excluding finance leases. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Company s reporting currency.

Based on the amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point change (increase or decrease) in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by 2.2 million. To hedge the Company's exposure to interest payment fluctuations on a portion of these borrowings, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100.0 million.
