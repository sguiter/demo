, compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The slight increase is primarily attributable to a remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability due to state rate adjustments and the establishment of a valuation allowance on a portion of the investment loss associated with the write-down of Linear as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in rate was partially offset by a reduction of cumulative interest expense due to the remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2024 , the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, was million, of which million is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet, with the remaining million recorded as a reduction to deferred tax assets. This balance consists of a temporary component of million, for which there is an equal and offsetting deferred tax asset, and a permanent component of million, which, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in the period of recognition. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company decreased the balance of the unrecognized tax benefits reserve due to management s evaluation and remeasurement of its settlement position related to the timing of recognition of income and losses related to the Company's loan and finance receivable portfolio. The Company had million of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had million of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, of which million is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining million was recorded as a reduction to deferred tax assets. The balance of million at December 31, 2023 included a permanent component of million. Based on the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain jurisdictions, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately million. The Company believes that it has adequately accounted for any material tax uncertainties in its existing reserves for all open tax years. The Company s U.S. tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. The statute of limitations related to the Company s consolidated Federal income tax returns is closed for all tax years up to and including 2019. The years open to examination by state, local and foreign government authorities vary by jurisdiction, but the statute of limitation is generally from the date the tax return is filed. For jurisdictions that have generated net operating losses, carryovers may be subject to the statute of limitations applicable for the year those carryovers are utilized. In these cases, the period for which the losses may be adjusted will extend to conform with the statute of limitations for the year in which the losses are utilized. In most circumstances, this is expected to increase the length of time that the applicable taxing authority may examine the carryovers by one year or longer, in limited cases.

 The Company primarily estimates the fair value of its loan and finance receivables portfolio using discounted cash flow models that have been internally developed. The models use inputs, such as estimated losses, prepayments, utilization rates, servicing costs and discount rates, that are unobservable but reflect the Company s best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. Certain unobservable inputs may, in isolation, have either a directionally consistent or opposite impact on the fair value of the financial instrument for a given change in that input. An increase to the net loss rate, prepayment rate, servicing cost, or discount rate would decrease the fair value of the Company s loans and finance receivables. When multiple inputs are used within the valuation techniques for loans, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change from another input. The fair value of the nonqualified savings plan assets was deemed Level 1 as they are publicly traded equity securities for which market prices of identical assets are readily observable. The fair value of the investment in trading security was deemed Level 1 as it is a publicly traded fund with active market pricing that is readily available. The Company had liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and December 31, 2023.

The carrying amount of restricted cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. The Company measures the fair value of its investment in unconsolidated investee using Level 3 inputs. Because the unconsolidated investee is a private company and financial information is limited, the Company estimates the fair value based on the best available information at the measurement date. The Company measures the fair value of its revolving line of credit using Level 3 inputs. The Company considered the fair value of its other long-term debt and the timing of expected payment(s). The fair values of the Company s Securitization Notes and senior notes are estimated based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which are deemed Level 2 inputs.

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 We are a leading technology and analytics company focused on providing online financial services. In 2023, we extended approximately 4.9 billion in credit or financing to borrowers and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we extended approximately 4.4 billion in credit or financing to borrowers. As of September 30, 2024, we offered or arranged loans or draws on lines of credit to consumers in 37 states in the United States and Brazil. We also offered financing to small businesses in 49 states and Washington D.C. in the United States. We use our proprietary technology, analytics and customer service capabilities to quickly evaluate, underwrite and fund loans or provide financing, allowing us to offer consumers and small businesses credit or financing when and how they want it. Our customers include the large and growing number of consumers who and small businesses which have bank accounts but use alternative financial services because of their limited access to more traditional credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. We were an early entrant into online lending, launching our online business in 2004, and through September 30, 2024, we have completed approximately 63.9 million customer transactions and collected more than 65 terabytes of currently accessible customer behavior data since launch, allowing us to better analyze and underwrite our specific customer base. We have significantly diversified our business over the past several years, having expanded the markets we serve and the financing products we offer. These financing products include installment loans and line of credit accounts. 
 We believe our customers highly value our products and services as an important component of their personal or business finances because our products are convenient, quick and often less expensive than other available alternatives. We attribute the success of our business to our advanced and innovative technology systems, the proprietary analytical models we use to predict the performance of loans and finance receivables, our sophisticated customer acquisition programs, our dedication to customer service and our talented employees. 
 We have developed proprietary underwriting systems based on data we have collected over our 20 years of experience. These systems employ advanced risk analytics, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, to decide whether to approve financing transactions, to structure the amount and terms of the financings we offer pursuant to jurisdiction-specific regulations and to provide customers with their funds quickly and efficiently. Our systems closely monitor collection and portfolio performance data that we use to continually refine machine learning-enabled analytical models and statistical measures used in making our credit, purchase, marketing and collection decisions. Approximately 90 of models used in our analytical environment are machine learning-enabled. 
 Our flexible and scalable technology platforms allow us to process and complete customers transactions quickly and efficiently. In 2023, we processed approximately 3.0 million transactions, and we continue to grow our loan and finance receivable portfolios and increase the number of customers we serve through desktop, tablet and mobile platforms. Our highly customizable technology platforms allow us to efficiently develop and deploy new products to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements and consumer preference, and to enter new markets quickly. 
 We have been able to consistently acquire new customers and successfully generate repeat business from returning customers when they need financing. We believe our customers are loyal to us because they are satisfied with our products and services. We acquire new customers from a variety of sources, including visits to our own websites, mobile sites or applications, and through direct marketing, affiliate marketing, lead providers and relationships with other lenders. We believe that the online convenience of our products and our 24/7 availability to accept applications with quick approval decisions are important to our customers. 
 Once a potential customer submits an application, we quickly provide a credit or purchase decision. If a loan or financing is approved, we or our lending partner typically fund the loan or financing the next business day or, in some cases, the same day. During the entire process, from application through payment, we provide access to our well-trained customer service team. All of our operations, from customer acquisition through collections, are structured to build customer satisfaction and loyalty, in the event that a customer has a need for our products in the future. We have developed a series of sophisticated proprietary scoring models to support our various products. We believe that these models are an integral component of our operations and allow us to complete a high volume of customer

transactions while actively managing risk and the related credit quality of our loan and finance receivable portfolios. We believe our successful application of these technological innovations differentiates our capabilities relative to competing platforms as evidenced by our history of strong growth and stable credit quality.

purchase the loans or a participating interest in receivables the bank originates. We do not guarantee the performance of the loans and line of credit accounts originated by the bank. The Bank Program that relates to the small business portfolio is with a separate bank and includes installment loans and line of credit accounts. We receive marketing fees while the bank receives origination fees and certain program fees. The bank has the ability to sell and we have the option, but not the requirement, to purchase the installment loans the bank originates and, in the case of line of credit accounts, extensions under those line of credit accounts. We do not guarantee the performance of the loans or line of credit accounts originated by the bank. 

Money transfer business. Under our Pangea brand, we operate a money transfer platform that allows customers to send money from the United States to Mexico, other Latin American countries and Asia.

 RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS 
 State of Washington SSB 6025 
 In March 2024, the Governor of the State of Washington signed into law a bill that amends the Consumer Loan Act CLA to add anti-evasion language and a predominant economic interest test for closed-end and open-end loans. In addition, the bill would prohibit engaging in any activity subject to the CLA without a license as required by the CLA. The law expands the CLA s coverage to include any loan made to a person physically located in Washington, in addition to the existing coverage of any loan made to a resident of Washington, by a licensee, or persons subject to this chapter . The current rate cap under the CLA is 25 . The law took effect on June 6, 2024, and applies to loans or advances originated on or after that date. We do not expect the changes brought about by this law to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
 On November 15, 2023, we consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which we agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions, to pay a civil money penalty of 15 million. The Consent Order relates to issues, the majority of which were self-disclosed, including payment processing and debiting errors. We remain subject to the restrictions and obligations of the Consent Order, including prohibitions from engaging in certain conduct for a period of seven years from the date of the Consent Order. Any noncompliance with the Consent Order or similar orders or agreements from other regulators could lead to further regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations. 
 On October 6, 2017, the CFPB issued its final rule entitled Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans (the Small Dollar Rule ), which covers certain consumer loans that we offer. The Small Dollar Rule initially required that lenders who make short-term loans and longer-term loans with balloon payments reasonably determine consumers ability to repay ATR the loans according to their terms before issuing the loans. The Small Dollar Rule also introduced new limitations on repayment processes for those lenders as well as lenders of other longer-term loans with an annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent that include an ACH authorization or similar payment provision. If a consumer has two consecutive failed payment attempts, the lender must obtain the consumer s new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the consumer s bank account. For loans covered by the Small Dollar Rule, lenders must provide certain notices to consumers before attempting a first payment withdrawal or an unusual withdrawal and after two consecutive failed withdrawal attempts. On July 7, 2020, the CFPB issued a final rule rescinding the ATR provisions of the Small Dollar Rule along with related provisions, such as the establishment of registered information systems for 
 23 

checking ATR and reporting loan activity. The payment provisions of the Small Dollar Rule remain in place. In April 2018, an action was filed against the CFPB making a constitutional challenge to the Small Dollar Rule. On October 19, 2022, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the funding structure of the CFPB is unconstitutional and vacated the Small Dollar Rule. The CFPB filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted the petition on February 27, 2023. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on October 3, 2023 and, on May 16, 2024, upheld the constitutionality of the funding structure of the CFPB and remanded the case back to the Fifth Circuit. On June 19, 2024, the Fifth Circuit rendered judgment in favor of the CFPB declaring that the CFPB s funding structure and the Small Dollar Rule are constitutional, and reinstated its judgment in favor of the CFPB for the Community Financial Services Association of America s CFSA alternative arguments. On July 3, 2024, the CFSA filed a petition for rehearing en banc. The Small Dollar Rule will likely not take effect until 286 days after resolution of the appeal as ordered by the Fifth Circuit when it extended the district court s stay of the compliance date in 2021. If the Small Dollar Rule does become effective in its current proposed form, we will need to make certain changes to our payment processes and customer notifications in our U.S. consumer lending business. 
 On March 30, 2023, the CFPB issued its final rule to implement Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1071 amended the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to require financial institutions to collect and report certain data in connection with credit applications made by small businesses, including women- or minority-owned small businesses, and applies to small business loans that we offer. For loans covered by the small business lending rule, a covered lender will be required to collect and report on certain information pursuant to an application for credit. Section 1071 requires covered lenders to collect and report information the financial institution generates and information obtained from the applicant, including the applicant s minority-owned business status, women-owned business status and LGBTQI+-owned status and the applicant s principal owners ethnicity, race and sex, and expressly prohibits a financial institution from discouraging an applicant from responding to requests for applicant-provided data. The implementation date was previously stayed pending a decision by the Supreme Court in Community Financial Services Association of America, Ltd. v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That stay has now been lifted. The effective date for tier 1 institutions, such as the Company s small business loan business, to comply with the implementing regulation is currently set as July 18, 2025. By the effective date, the Company s small business loan business will need to update its application process to appropriately collect, store, and report data required by Section 1071 s implementing regulation. 
 Minnesota Commerce Omnibus Bill 
 In May 2023, the Governor of Minnesota signed into law a bill that caps the APR on consumer small loans and consumer short-term loans at a 50 all-in APR and expressly provides for predominant economic interest and totality of the circumstance tests for true lender purposes. The bill defines "consumer small loan" as a consumer-purpose unsecured loan equal to or less than 350 that must be repaid in a single installment. The bill defines a "consumer short-term loan" as a loan to a borrower which has a principal amount, or an advance on a credit limit, of 1,300 or less and requires a minimum payment of more than 25 of the principal balance or credit advance within 60 days. The bill requires the lender to perform an ability to pay analysis if the all-in APR on a consumer small loan or consumer short-term loan exceeds 36 . The bill also codifies a predominant economic interest test for bank service arrangements whereby a broker or servicer with a predominant economic interest in a loan is considered to be the true lender for purposes of applying the rate cap. The law took effect on January 1, 2024 and applies to loans or advances originated on or after that date. The changes brought about by this law have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 European Union Pillar Two Directive 
 On December 15, 2022, the European Union EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation. As of September 30, 2024, among the jurisdictions where the Company operates, only the U.K. has enacted legislation adopting the Pillar Two Rules, effective in fiscal 2025. We do not expect the changes brought about by this directive to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of Loans and Finance Receivables 
 We carry our loans and finance receivables at fair value with changes in fair value recognized directly in earnings. We estimate the fair value of our loans and finance receivables primarily using internally-developed, discounted cash flow analyses to more accurately predict future payments. We adjust contractual cash flows for estimated losses, prepayments and servicing costs over the estimated duration of the underlying assets and discount the future cash flows using a rate of return that we believe a market participant would require. Model results may be adjusted by management if we do not believe the output reflects the fair value of the portfolio, as defined under GAAP. 
 25 

The models are updated at each measurement date to capture any changes in internal factors such as nature, term, volume, payment trends, remaining time to maturity, and portfolio mix, as well as changes in underwriting or observed trends expected to impact future performance. We have validated model performance by comparing past valuations with actual performance noted after each valuation. 
 During 2023 and continuing through September 30, 2024, views in the marketplace on the economy and its near-term prospects remained mixed with concerns on employment, inflation, and other macroeconomic trends. In certain situations, management concluded that the probability of future charge-offs or prepayments was different than what we had experienced in the past and, therefore, altered those assumptions in our fair value models. We continue to utilize this approach and have adjusted these assumptions where appropriate. We also evaluate the discount rates used in our models on a quarterly basis and adjust when appropriate to be responsive to changes in the market and representative of what a market participant would use. As of September 30, 2024, we deemed the resulting fair value of our loans and finance receivables to be an appropriate market-based exit price that considers current market conditions. 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with GAAP, we provide historical non-GAAP financial information. We present non-GAAP financial information because such measures are used by management in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
 Adjusted Earnings Measures 
 We provide adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, or, collectively, the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments and amortization methods, which can provide a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. We utilize, and also believe that investors utilize, the Adjusted Earnings Measures to assess operating performance, recognizing that such measures may highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we believe that the Adjusted Earnings Measures are useful to management and investors in comparing our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of certain items that are not indicative of our core operating performance or results of operations.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We provide Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure that we define as earnings excluding depreciation, amortization, interest, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, taxes, stock-based compensation expense and certain other items, as appropriate, that are not indicative of our core operating performance. We utilize, and also believe that investors utilize, Adjusted EBITDA to analyze operating performance and evaluate our ability to incur and service debt and our capacity for making capital expenditures. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in comparing our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of certain non-cash items and certain items that are not indicative of our core operating performance or results of operations.

EBITDA is also useful to investors to help assess our estimated enterprise value. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA, as presented below, may differ from the computation of similarly-titled measures provided by other companies (in thousands):

 Combined Loans and Finance Receivables Measures 
 In addition to reporting loans and finance receivables balance information in accordance with GAAP (see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report), we have provided metrics on a combined basis. The Combined Loans and Finance Receivables Measures are non-GAAP measures that include both loans and RPAs we own or have purchased and loans we guarantee, which are either GAAP items or disclosures required by GAAP. See Loan and Finance Receivable Balances and Credit Performance of Loans and Finance Receivables below for reconciliations between Company owned and purchased loans and finance receivables, gross, change in fair value and charge-offs (net of recoveries) calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Combined Loans and Finance Receivables Measures. 
 We believe these non-GAAP measures provide management and investors with important information needed to evaluate the magnitude of potential receivable losses and the opportunity for revenue performance of the loans and finance receivable portfolio on an aggregate basis. We also believe that the comparison of the aggregate amounts from period to period is more meaningful than comparing only the amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheet since both revenue and cost of revenue are impacted by the aggregate amount of receivables we own and those we guarantee as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 Revenue and Net Revenue 
 Revenue increased 138.5 million, or 25.1 , to 689.9 million for the current quarter as compared to 551.4 million for the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by a 38.0 increase in revenue from our small business portfolio and a 18.1 increase in revenue from our consumer portfolio as higher levels of originations have led to higher loan balances for both portfolios. 
 Net revenue for the current quarter was 400.3 million compared to 319.6 million for the prior year quarter. Our consolidated net revenue margin was 58.0 for the current quarter compared to 58.0 for the prior year quarter with stability in both the consumer and small business portfolios. Refer to Consumer Loans and Finance Receivables and Small Business Loans and Finance Receivables below for additional discussion of net revenue for the current quarter.

Loan and Finance Receivable Balances 
 The fair value of our loan and finance receivable portfolio in our consolidated financial statements was 4,134.4 million and 3,321.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The outstanding principal balance of our loan and finance receivables portfolio was 3,593.4 million and 2,904.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of the combined loan and finance receivables portfolio includes 25.4 million and 18.7 million with an outstanding principal balance of 18.3 million and 13.7 million of consumer loan balances that are guaranteed by us but not owned by us, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The consumer portfolio balance was 37.3 of our combined loan and finance receivable portfolio balance at fair value as of September 30, 2024, which decreased slightly compared to 39.1 as of September 30, 2023. Our small business portfolio of loans and finance receivables was 62.7 of our combined loan and finance receivable portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024, compared to 60.9 as of September 30, 2023.

(a) GAAP measure. The loans and finance receivables balances guaranteed by us relate to loans originated by a third-party lender through the CSO program that we have not yet purchased and, therefore, are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the ratio of fair value as a percentage of principal was 115.1 and 114.3 , respectively, on company owned loans and finance receivables and 115.2 and 114.4 , respectively, on combined loans and finance receivables. These ratios slightly increased compared to the prior year due to improvement in both the consumer and small business portfolios. Refer to Consumer Loans and Finance Receivables and Small Business Loans and Finance Receivables below for additional discussion of fair value ratios for the current quarter. 
 Average Amount Outstanding per Loan and Finance Receivable 
 The average amount outstanding per loan and finance receivable is calculated as the total combined loans and finance receivables, gross balance at the end of the period divided by the total number of combined loans and finance receivables outstanding at the end of the period. The following table shows the average amount outstanding per loan and finance receivable by product at September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (b) Includes loans guaranteed by us, which represent loans originated by a third-party lender through the CSO program that we have not yet purchased and, therefore, are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
 The average amount outstanding per loan and finance receivable decreased in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter for our overall portfolio due primarily to a mix shift in our consumer portfolio to line of credit accounts, which generally have lower average outstanding balances compared to installment loans. 
 Average Loan and Finance Receivable Origination 
 The average loan and finance receivable origination amount is calculated as the total amount of combined loans and finance receivables originated, renewed and purchased for the period divided by the total number of combined loans and finance receivables originated,

renewed and purchased for the period. The following table shows the average loan and finance receivable origination amount by product for the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter:

 (c) Represents the average amount of each incremental draw on line of credit accounts. 
 The average loan and finance receivable origination amount is smaller than the average amount outstanding per loan and finance receivable in the previous section as the former measure includes incremental draws on our line of credit accounts whereas the latter measure includes the entire outstanding receivable on our line of credit accounts. 
 The average loan and finance receivable origination amount increased to 1,572 during the current quarter from 1,506 during the prior year quarter, due primarily to a mix shift to small business loans, which have larger average origination amounts compared to consumer loans. 
 Credit Performance of Loans and Finance Receivables 
 We monitor the performance of our loans and finance receivables. Internal factors such as portfolio composition (e.g., interest rate, loan term, geography information, customer mix, credit quality) and performance (e.g., delinquency, loss trends, prepayment rates) are reviewed on a regular basis at various levels (e.g., product, vintage). We also weigh the impact of relevant, internal business decisions on the portfolio. External factors such as macroeconomic trends, financial market liquidity expectations, competitive landscape and legal/regulatory requirements are also reviewed on a regular basis. 
 The payment status of a customer, including the degree of any delinquency, is a significant factor in determining estimated charge-offs in the cash flow models that we use to determine fair value. The following table shows payment status on outstanding principal, interest and fees as of the end of each of the last five quarters (in thousands):

 (d) The average combined loan and finance receivable balance is the average of the month-end balances during the period. 
 The ending balance, including principal and accrued fees/interest outstanding, of combined consumer loans and finance receivables at September 30, 2024 increased 17.8 to 1,412.7 million compared to 1,199.3 million at September 30, 2023, due primarily to originations outpacing repayments. 
 The percentage of loans greater than 30 days delinquent of 8.7 was higher at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.8 at September 30, 2023, due primarily to a higher percentage of originations to new customers, which typically default at a higher rate compared to returning customers, and a mix shift to line of credit products, which have higher yields and default rates compared to installment loans. Charge-offs (net of recoveries) as a percentage of average combined loan balance was 14.9 for the current quarter, compared to 15.5 for the prior year quarter, which are both in line with seasonal norms. Demand for our consumer loan products and services in the United States has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, corresponding to the holiday season, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers receipt of income tax refunds. Higher originations, particularly to new 
 32 

customers, which typically default at a higher percentage than returning customers, generally result in higher delinquencies and charge-offs as the book is less seasoned. Charge-off performance in the current quarter follows this seasonal pattern. 
 Revenue related to our consumer loans and finance receivables was 410.9 million for the current quarter, compared to 347.9 million for the prior year quarter. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by growth in the overall portfolio, particularly our line of credit products. The net revenue margin related to our consumer loans and finance receivables was 50.4 in the current quarter, which was fairly consistent with the net revenue margin of 49.8 in the prior year quarter. 
 The ratio of fair value as a percentage of principal on consumer loans and finance receivables was 120.9 at September 30, 2024, compared to 119.5 at September 30, 2023 and 121.0 at June 30, 2024. The increase from the prior year quarter was due primarily to a mix shift towards line of credit products, which generally have a higher fair value as a percentage of principal compared to installment loans. Refer also to Results of Operations Valuation of Loans and Finance Receivables in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion on loan valuation.

 The ending balance, including principal and accrued fees/interest outstanding, of small business loans and finance receivables at September 30, 2024 increased 26.8 to 2,351.9 million compared to 1,855.1 million at September 30, 2023, due primarily to originations outpacing repayments. 
 The percentage of loans greater than 30 days delinquent of 7.2 was lower at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.0 at September 30, 2023. Charge-offs (net of recoveries) as a percentage of average loan balance were lower at 4.6 for the current quarter, compared to 5.5 in the prior year quarter. These metrics evidence the improvement in credit performance of our small business portfolio. 
 33 

Revenue related to our small business loans and finance receivables was 269.5 million for the current quarter, compared to 195.2 million for the prior year quarter. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by growth in the overall portfolio. The net revenue margin related to our small business loans and finance receivables was 69.1 for the current quarter, which is fairly consistent with the net revenue margin of 71.8 in the prior year quarter. 
 The ratio of fair value as a percentage of principal on small business loans and finance receivables was 112.0 at September 30, 2024, compared to 111.4 at September 30, 2023 and 112.0 at June 30, 2024. The increase from September 30, 2023 was due primarily to improved credit performance and slightly higher average yields. 
 Total Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses increased 30.7 million, or 14.3 , to 246.6 million in the current quarter, compared to 215.9 million in the prior year quarter. 
 Marketing expense increased to 141.1 million in the current quarter compared to 116.5 million in the prior year quarter due primarily to growth in the overall business with higher commissionable originations in our small business portfolio and higher online advertising costs intended to capture increasing market demand for both our consumer and small business loan products. 
 Operations and technology expense increased to 56.6 million in the current quarter compared to 51.7 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher variable costs, particularly personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, bank charges, collection and other selling expenses, due to the increase in originations and the size of the loan portfolio. As a percentage of revenue, operations and technology expense decreased to 8.2 in the current year quarter from 9.4 in the prior year quarter, as increased originations and revenues outpaced fixed costs. 
 General and administrative expense increased to 38.9 million in the current quarter compared to 37.7 million in the prior year quarter, due largely to higher personnel costs, partially offset by lower legal, consulting and occupancy costs. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense decreased to 5.6 in the current year quarter from 6.9 in the prior year quarter, as increased originations and revenues outpaced fixed costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense in the current quarter was flat compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Nonoperating Items 
 Interest expense, net increased 28.2 million, or 58.0 , to 76.9 million in the current quarter compared to 48.7 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding, which increased 869.4 million to 3,226.6 million during the current quarter from 2,357.2 million during the prior year quarter, and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 9.57 during the current quarter from 8.28 during the prior year quarter resulting primarily from year-over-year increases in benchmark rates. 
 Equity method investment loss was 16.6 million in the current quarter due to the write-down of our investment in Linear as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Other nonoperating expenses include 4.7 million related to the early extinguishment of our 8.50 senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes ). This amount includes a non-cash charge of 4.0 million consisting of the remaining deferred financing costs and an early redemption premium of 0.7 million. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate of 21.8 in the current quarter was lower than the 25.2 rate recorded in the prior year quarter due primarily to a reduction of cumulative interest expense due to the remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by an established valuation allowance on a portion of the investment loss associated with the write-down of Linear, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, and lower stock option exercises in the current quarter. 
 Net Income 
 Net income increased 2.1 million, or 5.2 , to 43.4 million during the current quarter compared to 41.3 million during the prior year quarter. The increase was due primarily to an increase in income from operations due to higher net revenue and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher interest expense, which was the result of an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt, and the write-down of our investment in Linear.

 Revenue increased 394.1 million, or 25.7 , to 1,928.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, or current nine-month period, as compared to 1,534.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, or prior year nine-month period. The increase was driven by a 30.6 increase in revenue from our small business portfolio and a 22.8 increase in revenue from our consumer portfolio as higher levels of originations have led to higher loan balances for both portfolios. 
 Net revenue for the current nine-month period was 1,116.4 million compared to 904.9 million for the prior year nine-month period. Our consolidated net revenue margin was 57.9 for the current nine-month period compared to 59.0 for the prior year nine-month period. The decrease in net revenue margin was driven primarily by lower net revenue margin in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by higher net revenue margin in the small business portfolio. 
 The following table sets forth the components of revenue and net revenue, separated by product for the current nine-month period and the prior year nine-month period (in thousands):

Average Loan and Finance Receivable Origination 
 The average loan and finance receivable origination amount is calculated as the total amount of combined loans and finance receivables originated, renewed and purchased for the period divided by the total number of combined loans and finance receivables originated, renewed and purchased for the period. The following table shows the average loan and finance receivable origination amount by product for the current nine-month period compared to the prior year nine-month period:

(a) The disclosure regarding the average loan origination amount is statistical data that is not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
 (b) Includes loans guaranteed by us, which represent loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO program that we have not yet purchased and, therefore, are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
 (c) Represents the average amount of each incremental draw on line of credit accounts. 
 The average loan and finance receivable origination amount decreased to 1,583 from 1,636 during the current nine-month period compared to the prior year nine-month period, due primarily to a mix shift to line of credit accounts, which generally have lower average draw amounts compared to installment loan originations. 
 Total Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses increased 106.5 million, or 18.4 , to 686.8 million in the current nine-month period, compared to 580.3 million in the prior year nine-month period. 
 Marketing expense increased to 372.4 million in the current nine-month period compared to 292.2 million in the prior year nine-month period. The increase was due primarily to growth in the overall business with higher online advertising costs intended to capture increasing market demand for both our consumer and small business loan products and higher commissionable originations in our small business portfolio. 
 Operations and technology expense increased to 165.9 million in the current nine-month period compared to 147.9 million in the prior year nine-month period, due primarily to higher variable costs, particularly personnel, collection and underwriting costs, due to the increase in originations and the size of the loan portfolio. As a percentage of revenue, operations and technology expense decreased to 8.6 in the current nine-month period from 9.6 in the prior year nine-month period, as increased originations and revenues outpaced fixed costs. 
 General and administrative expense increased 7.4 million, or 6.6 , to 118.5 million in the current nine-month period compared to 111.1 million in the prior year nine-month period, due primarily to higher personnel costs, partially offset by lower legal and consulting costs. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense decreased to 6.1 in the current nine-month period from 7.2 in the prior year nine-month period, as increased originations and revenues outpaced fixed costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.9 million or 3.0 compared to the prior year nine-month period driven primarily by general growth in the business and additional internal-use software placed in service. 
 Nonoperating Items 
 Interest expense, net increased 75.9 million, or 55.2 , to 213.5 million in the current nine-month period compared to 137.6 million in the prior year nine-month period. The increase was due primarily to an increase of 774.2 million in the average amount of debt outstanding to 3,076.0 million during the current nine-month period from 2,301.8 million during the prior year nine-month period, and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 9.37 during the current nine-month period from 8.10 during the prior year nine-month period. 
 Equity method investment loss was 16.6 million in the current nine-month period due to the write-down of our investment in Linear as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 36 

Other nonoperating expenses in the current nine-month period include 4.7 million related to the early extinguishment of our 2025 Senior Notes. This amount includes a non-cash charge of 4.0 million consisting of the remaining deferred financing costs and an early redemption premium of 0.7 million. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate of 24.8 in the current nine-month period was higher compared to the effective tax rate of 24.4 in the prior year nine-month period. The slight increase is primarily attributable to a remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability due to state rate adjustments, and the establishment of a valuation allowance on a portion of the investment loss associated with the write-down of Linear as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in rate was partially offset by a reduction of cumulative interest expense due to the remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Net Income 
 Net income increased 5.4 million, or 3.8 , to 145.8 million during the current nine-month period compared to 140.4 million during the prior year nine-month period. The increase was due primarily to an increase in income from operations due primarily to overall growth in the business driving an increase in net revenue and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Capital Funding Strategy 
 We seek to maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet to ensure that liquidity and funding are available to meet our business obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of 254.4 million, of which 186.9 million was restricted, compared to 377.4 million, of which 323.1 million was restricted, as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 217.2 million of asset-backed notes and entered into a 150.0 million consumer loan securitization facility to fund our growth in our near-prime consumer loan portfolio and issued 399.6 million of asset-backed notes to fund our growth in our small business loan portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also amended our revolving credit agreement and a small business securitization facility, increasing our borrowing capacity by 150.0 million and 200.4 million, respectively. Additionally, on October 2, 2024, we issued another 261.4 million of asset-backed notes to fund our growth in our small business loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we had funding capacity of 925.3 million. Based on numerous stressed-case modeling scenarios, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to run our operations for the foreseeable future. Further, we have no recourse debt obligations due until June 2026. As part of our capital and liquidity management, we may from time to time acquire our outstanding debt securities, including through redemptions, tender offers, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws and in compliance with the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities, upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine. 
 Historically, we have generated significant cash flow through normal operating activities for funding both long-term and short-term needs. Our near-term liquidity is managed to ensure that adequate resources are available to fund our seasonal working capital growth, which is driven by demand for our loan and financing products. On December 6, 2023, we issued and sold 400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.25 Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Senior Notes and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire existing indebtedness, including the remaining principal amount outstanding under our 8.50 senior notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes ). On August 12, 2024, we issued and sold 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.125 senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Senior Notes and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire existing indebtedness, including the remaining principal amount outstanding under our 2025 Senior Notes. 
 On June 23, 2022, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our existing secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement that, among other changes, increased the borrowing capacity to 440.0 million, with a 20.0 million letter of credit sublimit and 10.0 million swingline loan sublimit. On October 19, 2023, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other changes, increase the total commitment amount from 440.0 million to 515.0 million. On September 11, 2024, we further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other changes, increase the total commitment amount from 515.0 million to 665.0 million. The Credit Agreement bears interest, at our option, at the base rate plus 0.75 or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 3.50 . In addition to customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, the Credit Agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee calculated with respect to the unused portion of the commitment, and ranges from 0.15 per annum to 0.50 per annum depending on usage. The Credit Agreement contains certain prepayment penalties if it is terminated on or before the first and second anniversary dates, subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement matures on June 30, 2026. As of October 21, 2024, our available borrowings under the Credit Agreement were 341.4 million. Since 2016, we have entered into several loan securitization facilities and offered asset-backed notes to fund our growth, primarily in our near-prime consumer installment loan and small business loan portfolios. As of October 21, 
 37 

2024, we had funding capacity of 875.5 million. We expect that our operating needs, including satisfying our obligations under our debt agreements and funding our working capital growth, will be satisfied by a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing, replacement thereof or increase in borrowings thereunder, and securitization or sale of loans and finance receivables under our consumer and small business loan securitization facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial ratios, covenants and other requirements set forth in our debt agreements. Unexpected changes in our financial condition or other unforeseen factors may result in our inability to obtain third-party financing or could increase our borrowing costs in the future. To the extent we experience short-term or long-term funding disruptions, we have the ability to adjust our volume of lending and financing to consumers and small businesses that would reduce cash outflow requirements while increasing cash inflows through repayments. Additional alternatives may include the securitization or sale of assets, increased borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing or replacement thereof, and reductions in capital spending, which could be expected to generate additional liquidity. 
 Capital 
 Total stockholders equity decreased by 61.5 million to 1,178.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 1,240.2 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease of stockholders equity was driven primarily by repurchases of our outstanding common stock, which is discussed in more detail below, partially offset by net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. Our book value per share outstanding increased to 44.87 at September 30, 2024 from 42.63 at December 31, 2023, which was primarily driven by net income, partially offset by share repurchases. 
 On November 7, 2022, we announced the Board of Directors authorized an increase to our share repurchase program of up to 150.0 million through December 31, 2023 (the November 2022 Authorization ). The November 2022 Authorization went into effect in March 2023 upon exhaustion of our previous authorization. On October 24, 2023, we announced the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program totaling 300.0 million through December 31, 2024 (the October 2023 Authorization ), which replaced the November 2022 Authorization. The Company had repurchased 91.5 million of common stock under the November 2022 Authorization before it was terminated. On August 12, 2024, we announced the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program totaling 300.0 million through December 31, 2025, which replaced the October 2023 Authorization. The Company had repurchased 255.9 million of common stock under the October 2023 Authorization before it was terminated. Repurchases under our repurchase program will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any shares of our common stock. The authorization for the share repurchase program may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Board of Directors in its discretion at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 223.8 million in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program. 
 Cash 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are held primarily for working capital purposes and are used to fund a portion of our lending activities. From time to time, we use excess cash and cash equivalents to fund our lending activities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our policy is to invest cash in excess of our immediate working capital requirements in short-term investments, deposit accounts or other arrangements designed to preserve the principal balance and maintain adequate liquidity. Our excess cash may be invested primarily in overnight sweep accounts, money market instruments or similar arrangements that provide competitive returns consistent with our polices and market conditions. 
 Our restricted cash typically consists of funds held in accounts as reserves on certain debt facilities and as collateral for issuing bank partner transactions. We have no ability to draw on such funds as long as they remain restricted under the applicable arrangements but have the ability to use these funds to finance loan originations, subject to meeting borrowing base requirements. Our policy is to invest restricted cash held in debt facility related accounts, to the extent permitted by such debt facility, in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide liquidity. Accordingly, such cash is invested primarily in money market instruments that offer daily purchase and redemption and provide competitive returns consistent with our policies and market conditions. As of December 31, 2023, restricted cash also included 173.6 million in escrow related to the redemption of our 2024 Senior Notes on January 3, 2024.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 255.5 million, or 30.0 , to 1,108.1 million in the current nine-month period from 852.6 million for the prior year nine-month period. The increase was driven primarily by additional interest and fee income from growth in the loan portfolio, partially offset by additional interest expense on outstanding debt to fund growth in the loan portfolio. 
 We believe cash flows from operations and available cash balances and borrowings under our loan securitization facilities and Credit Agreement, which may include increased borrowings under our Credit Agreement, any refinancing or replacement thereof, and additional securitization of loans, will be sufficient to fund our future operating liquidity needs, including to fund our working capital growth. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 1,332.2 million for the current nine-month period compared to 928.4 million for the prior year nine-month period. This change was due primarily to loan originations outpacing repayments by a wider margin in the current nine-month period compared to the prior year nine-month period. 
 39 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities for the current nine-month period were driven primarily by 387.6 million in net borrowings under our securitization facilities, partially offset by 238.1 million in share repurchases and 43.7 million in net repayments of senior notes. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the prior year nine-month period were driven primarily by 230.0 million in net borrowings under our securitization facilities and 35.0 million in net borrowings under our revolving line of credit, partially offset by 86.4 million in share repurchases and 79.9 million in repayments of our 2024 Senior Notes.

Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender s option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Revolving Loans made hereunder or be refunded to Company. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest, throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
