equity
interest in NetCo Partners NetCo ). The Company also holds an approximately 31 interest in NewStem Ltd, an Israeli biotech
company NewStem which is currently in the process of liquidation. NovelStem was formerly known as Hollywood Media Corp.
The Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on January 22, 1993 and changed its name to NovelStem International Corp. in September
2018. 

NetCo
is a legacy media business interest which owns Net Force , a media franchise. 

Going
Concern, Liquidity and Management s Plans 

Since
inception, the Company has accumulated a deficit of approximately . The accumulated deficit of the Company subsequent to
its business focus shift and name change in September 2018 is approximately which is comprised primarily of allocated losses
from equity method investments and general and administrative costs incurred by the Company. 

The
Company will need to obtain additional funds to continue its operations. Management s plans with regard to these matters
include additional financing and fundraising as well as monetization of assets held related to equity method investments. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the
Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient cash from financing on terms acceptable to the Company, or that the Company will
realize any value from the intangible assets of NewStem, which is currently in the process of liquidation due to its inability to
raise funds for continued operations (see Note 3). 

The
Company has in place a finance agreement with two individuals who are shareholders and directors under which it borrowed 
and an additional finance agreement with a shareholder under which it borrowed for working capital needs (see Note 4). Additionally,
the Company entered into additional finance agreements with unrelated parties in December 2023 and April 2024 under which it borrowed
an additional for working capital needs and to fund NewStem (see Note 4). As of the date of these financial statements, all
funds available pursuant to these agreements have been received and these borrowings are projected to fund operations through November
2024. The Company will need to obtain additional funds to continue operations for the next 12 months. 

In
view of the matters described above, the Company s ability to meet financing requirements is dependent upon the ability to complete
additional fundraising or obtain additional financing, and/or monetize its investment in NetCo, along with monetizing intangible assets
of NewStem. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations for interim reporting. The Company believes that the disclosures contained herein are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company s Form 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and
2022. 

. Under the equity method of accounting, an investee company s
accounts are not reflected within the Company s balance sheets or statements of operations; however, the Company s share
of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption Equity in net loss of investee company 
in the statements of operations. The Company s carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption
 Investment in investee company in the Company s balance sheets. 

The
Company reviews equity investments for impairment on an annual basis, or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts might not be recoverable. 

The
Company holds a minority investment in an entity, NewStem, which is currently undergoing liquidation (accounted for pursuant to the equity
method of accounting). Additionally, the Company is a partner in NetCo (which is accounted for pursuant to the equity method of accounting).
See Note 3. 

.
Proceeds from the note payable are included in cash from financing instruments and the loss on derivative instrument is included as
an adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities in the statement of cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024.

to NewStem. This funding was to be provided through the sale of up to common shares of NewStem to the Company representing
 of New Stem s outstanding shares. In 2018, the Company purchased shares of NewStem for acquiring an ownership
interest of . The Company made additional investments in 2019 and 2020 purchasing shares each year for a investment
each year. NewStem sold and issued shares to third party investors in 2021, 2022 and 2023 resulting in the Company recognizing a gain
on dilution of equity method investment. These transactions resulted in the Company having an ownership interest of as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The
Company accounts for its investment in NewStem under the equity method. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the investment
in NewStem exceeded its portion of the underlying net assets of NewStem by approximately . The excess related to identified
intangible assets including license agreements, specialized work force (goodwill) and two separate projects of in process research and
development IPR D related to stem cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics for cancer chemotherapies. 

The
Company assesses its investment in NewStem for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 indicators of impairment became evident due to the inability of NewStem to raise funds to continue
operations. Due to the inability to raise funds, NewStem has been unable to continue operations and is in the process of liquidation.
The intangible assets of NewStem, including license agreements, have reverted to Yissum (the commercial division of Hebrew University).
The Company is in negotiations with Yissum regarding the potential monetization of these intangible assets and the percentages of any
funds to be received by the Company. Due to the current uncertainty of the recovery of any value from these intangible assets
and the liquidation status of NewStem, the Company has fully impaired the investment in NewStem and reduced the carrying value to zero at September 30, 2024, recognizing an impairment loss of during the nine and three
months ended September 30, 2024. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a reimbursement due to NewStem of approximately (included in accounts
payable in the accompanying balance sheet) for audit and accounting related costs. During the nine and three months ended September 30,
2023, the Company reimbursed NewStem for audit related costs of approximately and , respectively. 

The
Company signed an agreement (the Purchase Agreement on June 20, 2024 to acquire the remainder of NewStem in exchange
for shares of Company stock as well as funding for NewStem operations in the amount of within 30 days of the Purchase
Agreement date and an additional in capital funding to be provided to NewStem by October 15, 2024. 

In
anticipation of this transaction, the Company advanced 
to NewStem in December 2023 and an additional 
in March 2024. The related note agreement bears no interest and is payable on . The agreement provides for discharge of the note upon the closing of the anticipated acquisition transaction. The
Purchase Agreement was not fully consummated, and no Company shares were issued to NewStem shareholders in exchange for NewStem
shares, therefore the note was not discharged. Because of the uncertainty in collection, the note was written off as uncollectible
effective September 30, 2024 due to the liquidation status of NewStem.

partner in NetCo. The Company initiated the arbitration proceeding
in an effort to maximize the total potential value to be derived from fully utilizing the NetCo intellectual property across publishing,
entertainment, digital media, merchandising and other ancillary markets. Arbitration hearings were held at the end of July 2022. Arbitration
proceedings for the joint owners of NetCo concluded during 2022 and the arbitrator rendered a decision in July 2023. 

The
Arbitrator ruled in NovelStem s favor on the issue of contract interpretation of the NetCo Partners Joint Venture Agreement.
The Arbitrator also found that the Company s joint venture partner failed to use reasonable, good faith efforts 
to license and exploit the Net Force concept, in breach of its contractual obligations under the NetCo Partners Joint Venture
Agreement. The Arbitrator confirmed NovelStem s contractual right to use Tom Clancy s name as a possessory credit in the
Net Force title (Tom Clancy s Net Force). 

The Arbitrator ruled against NovelStem
in claims of breach of the joint venture agreement as well as claims of breach of fiduciary responsibility by the partner, claims
for monetary damages were denied and attempts to re-write the joint venture agreement were denied. 

As
a result of this ruling, the costs related to the litigation funding agreement disclosed in Note 4 were recognized and a total liability
of was recorded at December 31, 2023.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Statements
in the following discussion and throughout this Form 10-Q that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements. 
You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as expect, anticipate, estimate, 
 may, will, should, intend, believe, and similar expressions. Although
we believe the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are inherently subject to risk
and we can give no assurances that our expectations will prove to be correct. Actual results could differ from those described in this
Form 10-Q because of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect actual outcomes. 

Overview 

We
are a development stage company and reported net losses of approximately 3,070,000 and 4,240,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2,464,000 and 1,096,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We had current assets of approximately 69,000 and current liabilities of 3,599,000 as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023,
our current assets and current liabilities were approximately 87,000 and 346,000, respectively. The significant increase in current
liabilities is primarily due to the litigation funding agreement liability classification changing from noncurrent to current in January
2024. 

We
have prepared our financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 assuming that we will continue as a going concern.
Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the continuing financial support from our shareholders and the ability to monetize
our investment in NetCo and our right to value from NewStem intangible assets. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale
of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions, large alternative minimum tax refunds, and related party
debt as well as debt from unrelated parties. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. In the discussion below, general
and administrative expenses are referred to as G A expenses .

We
are a holding company whose primary asset is our ownership of equity interest in NetCo and potential value from intangible assets of
NewStem. We conduct no other business and as a result, we have no revenue or cost of revenue. We do charge annual administrative fees
to an affiliated entity. 

The
Company incurs G A expenses primarily related to professional fees, insurance and stock based compensation. We incurred G A expenses
of approximately 894,000 and 635,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Specifically, professional
fees increased by approximately 31,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2023, primarily due to an increase in audit fees and general counsel legal fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we
incurred bad debt expense of 500,000 from the write off of a receivable from NewStem and other miscellaneous G A expenses increased
by approximately 11,000. 

Stock
compensation expense, included in G A expenses, decreased by approximately 261,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the cost incurred related to the extension of the term of outstanding warrants
in May 2023. 

We
incurred G A expenses of approximately 567,000 and 84,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease in G A expenses relates primarily to the bad debt expense from the write off of 500,000 due from NewStem as currently
deemed uncollectible, a decrease in professional fees of approximately 3,000 offset by an increase in other general and administrative
costs of approximately 6,000 and a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately 8,000. 

15 

Interest
expense increased by approximately 250,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023 due to the increased debt incurred through September 30, 2024. 

Interest
expense increased by approximately 77,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023 due to the increased debt incurred through September 30, 2024. 

The
Company has recorded no income tax expense as we have incurred operating losses and all deferred tax assets are fully offset by an income
tax valuation allowance. 

We
reported net losses from equity method investees in all periods presented. The net losses reported for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 included a loss from NetCo of 4,164 and a loss from NewStem of 155,577. The net losses reported for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 included net income of 5,362 from NetCo which was offset by net loss of 256,890 from NewStem. 

We
reported impairment expense of 1,628,657 related to our investment in NewStem during the nine and three months ended September 30,
2024. There were no such impairment losses during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have not paid dividends on our common stock since our name change in 2018. Our present policy is to apply cash
to reduce debt; consequently, we do not expect to pay dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future. 

The
Company will need to obtain additional funds to continue its operations. Management s plans with regard to these matters include
additional financing and fundraising until we are able to monetize our investment in NetCo or monetize our right to a portion of the
value of NewStem intangible assets now held by Yissum. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that
the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient cash from financing on terms acceptable to the Company. 

In
May 2022, the Company entered into note agreements with Jan Loeb, our Executive Chairman and Jerry Wolasky, a member of the Board, to
borrow up to an aggregate of 600,000 for working capital needs. The note agreements were amended in March 2024 to increase the total
borrowing to 650,000 and extend the maturity date. The agreements provide for interest at a rate of 8 per annum, increased to 10 per
annum for advances subsequent to November 11, 2022, and matured September 1, 2025. These note agreements were refinanced on August 7,
2024 at which time they were replaced with new note agreements providing for total borrowings of 750,000. The Company received additional
advances on these agreements totaling 100,000 in August 2024. 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, the full amount of 750,000 has been funded pursuant to these agreements. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into a note agreement with a shareholder to borrow 300,000 for continued working
capital. This note bears interest at zero percent (0 and matures on May 5, 2025. The note includes a guarantee which has been identified
as an embedded derivative with a fair value of a liability of 650,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

16 

In
December 2023, the Company entered into two short term notes payable with unrelated parties for a total of 250,000 in borrowings utilized
for the funding of NewStem. The notes bear interest at 12 per annum and mature December 21, 2024, at which time all principal and accrued
interest are due and payable. The note agreements include a provision whereby, in the event of a capital raise transaction by the Company,
the note holders would be entitled to participate in the transaction in an amount equal to 133 of the amounts owed on the note agreements
at the closing of the transaction. 

In
April 2024, the Company borrowed 100,000 from unrelated parties pursuant to convertible debt agreements. These agreements bear interest
at 10 per annum and mature December 30, 2025. The unpaid principal balance of these notes and any accrued interest may be converted
into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of 0.13 per share. 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was approximately 805,000, which consisted primarily
of a net loss of approximately 3,070,000, offset by noncash equity in loss of equity method investees of approximately 160,000, impairment
loss on NewStem of approximately 1,629,000, accretion of discount on notes payable of approximately 133,000, stock based compensation
of approximately 31,000, interest added to notes payable of approximately 78,000 and loss on derivative instrument of 90,000. Additionally,
cash was used in operations related to a decrease in current assets of approximately 9,000 and an increase in accrued liabilities and
other payables of approximately 207,000. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was approximately 269,000, which consisted primarily
of a net loss of approximately 4,240,000, offset by noncash equity in loss of equity method investees of approximately 251,000 and
distributions from equity method investees of approximately 7,000, accretion of discount on notes payable of approximately 30,000,
stock based compensation of approximately 293,000, interest added to notes payable of approximately 25,000, litigation funding agreement
costs of approximately 2,799,000 and loss on derivative instrument of 500,000. Additionally, cash was used in operations related to
a decrease in current assets of approximately 10,000 and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of approximately 56,000. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 250,000 was loaned to NewStem in an investing activity in anticipation of a potential purchase
of the remaining interest in NewStem. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no net cash was used in investing activities. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 475,000, consisting of long-term borrowings
from two directors and a significant stockholder totaling 375,000 and convertible debt of 100.000. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 270,000, consisting of long-term borrowings
from two directors.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Our
Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of our controls and procedures. We have identified material
weaknesses in our internal control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If not remediated, our failure to establish
and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements
in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. 

Maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce
reliable financial statements. We have re-evaluated our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures
and concluded that they were not effective as of September 30, 2024 and we concluded there was a material weakness in the design of our
internal control over financial reporting as it relates to insufficient resources to employ proper segregation of duties over the processing
of transactions and financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during
the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 

PART II 

ITEM
 1. 
 LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS 

As
noted above, NetCo owns all rights to the Tom Clancy s Net Force intellectual property in all media, including film,
television, and video games. As part of the joint venture, NetCo has published more than a dozen books and had an ABC miniseries. 

After
Tom Clancy passed away in 2013, his estate and business partners refused to cooperate in exploiting the intellectual property. After
trying to amicably resolve the dispute, the Company initiated arbitration proceedings with the American Arbitration Association. The
Company s arbitration demand asserted claims for breach of the joint venture agreement and breach of fiduciary duty. Both claims
arise from C.P. Group s failure to make reasonable, good faith efforts to exploit the full array of media rights relating to Net
Force. The Company s goal is to maximize the total potential value of the NetCo intellectual property across video games, streaming,
digital media, merchandising and other ancillary markets. The Company believes that the value of the intellectual property is significant. 

18 

The
arbitration evidentiary hearing concluded on October 20, 2022, and the arbitrator ordered the parties to submit post-hearing briefs.
Final briefs were filed in January 2023. The Arbitrator ruled in the Company s favor on two issues of the arbitration and ruled
against the Company in other key issues. 

The
Arbitrator confirmed NovelStem s contractual right to use Tom Clancy s name as a possessory credit in the Net Force title
(Tom Clancy s Net Force). However, the arbitrator did not award any damages to the Company and did not cede operating control of
the joint venture to the Company as requested. As such, the Company continues to struggle to maximize the potential of the NetCo asset. 

To
fund efforts to maximize the value of NetCo, NovelStem has secured non-recourse litigation funding. As a result of this ruling, the costs
related to the litigation funding agreement were recognized. All costs related to the litigation and the related litigation funding agreement
were recorded by the Company for a total liability of 2,819,196.
