of contract rights related to the cellular industry, in consideration of assuming liabilities of CS Agency in the approximate amount of
 . With the completion of the KonaTel Nevada Merger, we succeeded to the current and intended business operations of KonaTel Nevada. 

On December 31, 2018, we acquired Apeiron Systems
(www.apeiron.io). Apeiron was organized in 2013 and is an international hosted services Communications Platform as a Service CPaaS provider that designed, built, owns and operates its national private core network, supporting a suite of business communications services,
all accessible via proprietary Applications Programming Interfaces APIs ). As a Federal Communication Commission (the FCC licensed Internet Telephony Service Provider ITSP ), Apeiron also holds an FCC numbering authority license. Some of Apeiron s
hosted services include Voice over IP VoIP ), cellular and Over-The-Top OTT telephony, SMS/MMS messaging
and broadcast services, numbering features, including Cloud IVRs, Voicemail, Fax, Call Recording and other services through local, toll-free
and international phone numbers. Supported by its national redundant network, Apeiron also provides public and private IP network services,
including Multiprotocol Label Switching MPLS ), Dedicated Internet and LTE Wireless WAN solutions. Apeiron s cloud
services include Information Data Dips, Software-Defined Wide Area Networking SD-WAN and Internet of Things IoT data and device management. Apeiron primarily distributes its services nationally through its website, its sales staff, independent sales
agents and Independent Sales Organizations ISOs ). 

Apeiron Systems is headquartered in Johnstown, Pennsylvania,
where it has customer service and software engineering resources staffed. Additional development resources are staffed out of Los Angeles,
California, as well as in Europe and Asia. 

On February 5, 2018, we entered into a purchase agreement
to acquire 100 of the membership interest in IM Telecom (www.infinitimobile.com). On October 23, 2018, the FCC approved our acquisition
of IM Telecom, and on January 31, 2019, we completed the purchase of IM Telecom. IM Telecom operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of KonaTel
until the sale of 51 of its membership interest to Excess Telecom on January 22, 2024, which is discussed below. It is
an FCC licensed Eligible Telecommunications Carrier ETC and is one of twenty-two (22) original FCC licensed wireless cellular
resellers to hold an FCC approved Lifeline Compliance Plan since 2012, of which approximately twelve (12) license holders remain active
today. The FCC has not approved (granted) a new wireless reseller Lifeline Compliance Plan since 2012. In addition to being authorized
to offer wireless services in the fifty (50) states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, IM Telecom has been licensed
by the FCC to offer Lifeline and is designated as an ETC in thirty-eight (38) states/territories which are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, US Virgin
Islands, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 

IM Telecom has been an FCC licensed Affordable Connectivity
Program (the ACP and the ACP Program provider, authorized to distribute ACP subsidized high-speed mobile
voice/data service in the fifty (50) states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. As of June 1, 2024, the ACP Program ended in its current
form. The ACP Extension Act, among other legislative initiatives, is being considered by Congress for purposes of extending
the ACP Program. Stand-alone ACP customers have been given the opportunity to enroll in the Lifeline program, in lieu of ACP benefits.
Customers already enrolled in Lifeline, in combination with ACP benefits, continue with Lifeline services. Lifeline is an FCC program
that provides subsidized, fixed or mobile telecommunications services to low-income Americans. The ACP Program was an FCC program that
provided subsidized high-speed wireless data services to low-income Americans. IM Telecom distributes Lifeline, and prior to June 1, 2024,
had distributed ACP services, under its Infiniti Mobile brand name through its website, retail locations and ISOs. IM Telecom also offers
non-Lifeline and non-ACP services throughout the United States. IM Telecom has a US-based customer support center located in Atmore, Alabama. 

On
January 22, 2024 (the Effective Date ), KonaTel and IM Telecom entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the
 Excess Telecom Purchase Agreement or the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Excess Telecom, Inc.,
a Nevada corporation Excess Telecom ), pursuant to which KonaTel conveyed of
its membership interest in IM Telecom to Excess Telecom on the Initial Closing Date in consideration of the sum of ,
and if approved by the FCC, will convey the remaining 51 of the membership interest in IM Telecom to Excess Telecom for the sum of 100
on the Final Closing. If not approved by the FCC, KonaTel shall retain 51 of IM Telecom and Excess Telecom shall retain
49 of IM Telecom; and KonaTel shall have no obligation to refund any portion of the funds paid by Excess Telecom to KonaTel . 

IM Telecom is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and has
a warehouse operation in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a customer service center in Atmore, Alabama. We are headquartered in Plano, Texas. 

Apeiron Systems has eleven (11) full-time employees.
The current employees of IM Telecom, twenty-two (22) full-time and one (1) part-time, novated to employees of KonaTel under the Excess
Telecom Purchase Agreement. These employees continue to engage in the same manner and function of service provided prior to the aforementioned
agreement. KonaTel has four (4) other full-time employees. 

Principal Products
or Services and their Markets 

Our principal products and
services, provided through Apeiron Systems and IM Telecom, include our CPaaS suite of services (SIP/VoIP, SMS/MMS, POTS Replacement),
wholesale and retail mobile voice and mobile data IoT services, wholesale voice termination services, and our ETC and ACP subsidized services
for low-income Americans. Except for our ETC Lifeline services distributed in up to thirty-eight (38) states/territories and our ACP services,
which until June 1, 2024, had been distributed in the fifty (50) states, as well as Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, our Apeiron Systems 
products and services are available worldwide and subject to U.S., international and local/national regulations. 

We generate revenue from
two (2) primary sources, Hosted Services and Mobile Services: 

Our Hosted Services include a suite of hosted CPaaS services within Apeiron Systems cloud platform, including Cloud IVRs, Voicemail, Fax, Call Recording and other services provided with local, toll-free and international phone numbers. Apeiron also delivers public and private IP network services from its national redundant network backbone, including MPLS, Dedicated Internet and LTE Wireless WAN solutions. Additionally, Apeiron s Cloud Services include Information Data Dips, SD-WAN and IoT data and device management, of which IoT provides device connectivity via wireless 4G/5G. These Hosted Services are marketed nationally and internationally through the Apeiron website, its sales staff, independent sales agents and ISOs. 

Our Mobile Services
 include retail and wholesale cellular voice/text/data services and IoT mobile data services through Apeiron Systems and
 IM Telecom. Mobile voice/text/data and IoT mobile data services are supported by a blend of reseller agreements with select national
 wireless carriers and national wireless wholesalers. A wireless communications service reseller typically does not own the wireless
 network infrastructure over which services are provided to its customers. Mobile voice/text/data and mobile data solutions are
 generally sold as traditional post-paid service plans that may include voice/text/data or wireless data only plans. Sometimes,
 equipment is provided, which can include, but is not limited to, phones, tablets, modems, routers and accessories. Also included in
 our Mobile Services segment is the distribution of government subsidized mobile voice service and mobile data service by IM Telecom
 under its Infiniti Mobile brand and FCC license to low-income American households that qualify for the FCC s Lifeline mobile voice service program and/or previously under the FCC s ACP Program. Even though government programs like Lifeline have existed since 1985, these programs, along with newer programs like the ACP Program, are subject to change and any change, reduction or elimination may have a material impact on our Mobile Services business.

and the second largest customer is the federal government, as administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company USAC ),

Going Concern 

For the nine (9) months ended September
30, 2024, the Company generated net income of , compared to a net loss for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023, of ). The Company sold a 49 interest in IM Telecom, which allowed the business to pay off all outstanding debt and retain additive
cash. The accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024, is ). 

We are one of only a few telecommunication carriers
to hold a national wireless ETC Lifeline license, which provides us with additive reimbursement rates within the states we operate. In
Q2 2024, we added an additional ten (10) state licenses, which continues to expand our nationally licensed wireless service coverage.
We have continued to target and expand into additional ETC licensed states. 

As of June 1, 2024, funding for the ACP Program ended,
which accounted for approximately 15 of our revenues in Q2 2024 and 33 of our revenues in Q1 2024. Legislative efforts to extend funding
remain within Congress, however, the decision to further fund the ACP Program (or a similar program) is still uncertain. In light of this
uncertainty, the Company took initial steps to reduce costs in Q2 2024 while discussions continued in Congress, and we moved resources
and focus in our mobile services segment to California. With the California Lifeline Program, through its additional state funding and
Linkup program, the business was able to retain continuity in the mobile services market. In Q3 2024, the Company received a cease and
desist letter from the State of California CPUC, specific to a marketing program by one of our master distribution partners. The inquiry
into this matter has impacted the timing of payments on our qualified claims (see the heading Concentration of Credit Risk 
in NOTE 1 above). 

Through September 30, 2024, and with no visible
progress towards an extension of the ACP Program within Congress, the Company is in the process of further cost reduction measures,
including reductions within our workforce. Although the Company eliminated its outstanding debt and increased its cash position
earlier in the year, uncertainty around the ACP Program, the recent impact on our business in the State of California, and program
launch timing for our VIVA-US Telecommunications, Inc. VIVA-US and our other ongoing health care sales initiatives
will play significant roles in our ability to continue operations without more drastic reductions. The lack of our success with any
of these foregoing initiatives raises substantial doubt about our ability to remain a going concern for the twelve (12) month period
from the date of this Quarterly Report.

Tax Audits 

In June of 2021, the Company received an audit determination
and assessment from the State of Pennsylvania related to sales and use tax for the audit period of January 1, 2016, through September
30, 2019. The assessment is in the amount of , including interest and penalties calculated on sales made inside and outside Pennsylvania.
The Company has recorded the full amount of this assessment. The Company appealed the assessment in August, 2021, and at the request of
the state, provided additional information to support its appeal. The Company s position is that Pennsylvania has no sales tax authority
to levy and collect sales tax on sales made outside of Pennsylvania. The Company initially recorded an expected liability of , based
on known sales inside Pennsylvania. The State of Pennsylvania rejected an appeal by the Company. The Company has agreed to a twenty-four
(24) month payment plan with the State of Pennsylvania, which commenced in December, 2023. Following the final payoff of the liability,
the Company may have the right to re-open an appeal with the state for a refund of the liability.

 reportable segments. The Company s
management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the profit or loss from operations. Because the Company is a recurring
revenue service business with very few physical assets, management does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding operations,
and therefore, the total assets disclosure by segment has not been included. 

The reportable segments consist of Hosted Services
and Mobile Services. Mobile Services reporting consists of our post-paid and pre-paid cellular business. 

Hosted Services Our Hosted Services
include a suite of hosted CPaaS services within the Apeiron Systems cloud platform, including Cloud IVRs, Voicemail, Fax, Call
Recording and other services provided with local, toll-free and international phone numbers. Apeiron also delivers public and private
IP network services from its national redundant network backbone, including MPLS, Dedicated Internet and LTE Wireless WAN solutions. Additionally,
Apeiron s Cloud Services include Information Data Dips, SD-WAN and IoT data and device management. These Hosted Services are marketed
nationally and internationally through the Apeiron website, its sales staff, independent sales agents and ISOs. 

Mobile Services Our Mobile Services
include retail and wholesale cellular voice/text/data services and IoT mobile data services through Apeiron Systems and IM Telecom. Mobile
voice/text/data and IoT mobile data services are supported by a blend of reseller agreements with select national wireless carriers and
national wireless wholesalers. A wireless communications service reseller typically does not own the wireless network infrastructure over
which services are provided to its customers. Mobile voice/text/data and mobile data solutions are generally sold as traditional post-paid
service plans that may include voice/text/data or wireless data only plans. Sometimes equipment is provided, which can include, but is
not limited to, phones, tablets, modems, routers and accessories. Also included in our Mobile Services segment is the distribution of
government subsidized mobile voice service and mobile data service by IM Telecom under its Infiniti Mobile brand and FCC Lifeline license
to low-income American households that qualify for the FCC s Lifeline mobile voice service program and/or the FCC s ACP mobile
data program. Even though government programs like Lifeline have existed since 1985, these programs, along with newer programs like the
ACP Program, are subject to change and may have a material impact on our Mobile Services business if changed, reduced or eliminated.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

When used in this Quarterly Report, the words may, 
 will, expect, anticipate, continue, estimate, project, 
 intend, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27a of
the Securities Act and Section 21e of the Exchange Act regarding events, conditions and financial trends that may affect our future plans
of operations, business strategy, operating results and financial position. Persons reviewing this Quarterly Report are cautioned
that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results
may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors are discussed
at the forepart of this Quarterly Report under the caption Forward-Looking Statements and include general economic factors,
cybersecurity and conditions that may directly or indirectly impact our financial condition or results of operations. 

Despite risks and
uncertainties specifically related to Covid-19, the Company has not experienced adverse impacts to our business operations as a result
of this ongoing health concern. Possible vulnerabilities to Covid-19, such as supply chain disruptions, inventory shortages and
travel or resource limitations and delays will continue to be a risk that is presented to the Company, our suppliers, our customers and
our investors. 

Overview of Current and Planned Business Operations 

We continue to pursue market
opportunities for the distribution of our current products and services described in our Principal Products or Services and their
Markets summary commencing on page nine (9) of this Quarterly Report. In addition, we continue to pursue expanded market distribution
opportunities, development of new products and services, the addition of new lines of business and accretive acquisition opportunities
that may enhance or expand our current product and service offerings. 

Results of Operations 

As stated previously in our filings during 2023,
including our 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 (see Part II-Other Information, Item 6, Exhibits, below, for a Hyperlink
to this Annual Report), we shifted our focus of mobile services activations to higher ARPU areas Average Revenue Per User within our eleven (11) Lifeline states. As of September 30, 2024, we have added twenty-seven (27) new Lifeline states/territories,
for a total of thirty-eight (38) Lifeline states/territories. This expanded footprint provides our mobile services business with
additional opportunities to serve customers. Under IM Telecom s national ETC license, and in accordance with the Excess
Telecom Purchase Agreement, the Company will continue to enroll and provide services to qualifying consumers in the FCC Lifeline Program.
The Lifeline Program is a separate program from the ACP Program under the FCC, and remains committed and viable in support of providing
affordable communication services for low-income consumers. 

As mentioned in our Q1 2024 filing, funding for the
FCC ACP Program was expected to sunset, or partially sunset, in April, 2024, according to an FCC announcement on February 7, 2024. 
Due to a lack of additional funding from Congress, the ACP program has ended. Effective June 1, 2024, households were no longer eligible
to receive an ACP discount. The Company placed the customers that were participating in the ACP Program into a dormant state, which would
allow for the customer handset and data service to be re-engaged should the ACP Program be extended and re-funded. During Q3, these customers
were provided with an opt in available product that would allow them to convert from ACP to a Lifeline only service pending
the outcome of several Congressional paths to restore the ACP Program. This product was available to customers that were in an authorized
Lifeline territory. The ACP Program had recently contributed approximately 30-35 of total Company revenues. In Q2 2024, ACP revenues
were approximately 14 of total Company revenue; Hosted Services CPaaS services were approximately 40 of total Company
revenue; and Lifeline sales accounted for approximately 42 of total Company revenue. The Lifeline Program is a U.S. government subsidized
telecommunication program created in 1985. It is separately funded from the ACP Program through fees collected from all U.S. telecommunication
invoices. According to the National Lifeline Association NaLA ), there were at least eight (8) separate ACP refunding legislative
efforts currently moving through the U.S. Congress. Approximately 22 million American households were receiving ACP Program benefits,
and ACP refunding efforts generally enjoy wide bi-partisan support. Regardless of the ACP s future funding status, management continues
to prioritize its growth initiatives within the Company s Hosted Services segment. Specifically, our Hosted Services revenue
for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024, grew 14.6 over the nine (9) months period ended September 2023. In Q1 2024, the
Company added direct sales resources to our Hosted Services team, in an effort to expand revenues through established relationships in
the wholesale, ISP, and carrier verticals. Operational resources were also added to this segment, to support new growth initiatives. 

In Q1 2024, the Company chose to expand and reallocate
its resources in California to offset the potential risk of an ACP Program end. In lieu of retaining the ACP subsidy, California offers
state and federal subsidies which are similar in value to the ACP subsidy. Since Lifeline services are funded by the Federal Universal
Service Fund FUSF ), and not subject to enactment or renewal of government funded appropriations, the Company chose to redirect
resources to California Lifeline, where ARPU is equal to or greater than that of ACP. Our California Lifeline revenue for the nine (9)
months ended September 30, 2024, grew 209.0 over the nine (9) months period ended September 2023 

17 

As previously reported during the first quarter of
2024, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Excess Telecom to sell 49 of IM Telecom in consideration
of the sum of 10,000,000. As part of this sale, the Company paid off all existing and outstanding debt, and gained substantial
additional liquidity and Owner s Equity into the business. Upon final sale of the remaining 51 , if approved by the FCC, the Company
shall have the right to continue providing Lifeline qualified services through a Master Distribution Agreement with Excess Telecom, for
not less than ten (10) years. If the FCC does not approve Excess Telecom s petition to acquire IM Telecom under the Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement, KonaTel shall retain 51 ownership of IM Telecom and no monies paid by Excess Telecom to KonaTel shall be
refundable. Further, if on or before December 31, 2024, the ACP Program is renewed by the U.S. Congress for a duration of greater than
four (4) months (the ACP Renewal Condition ), Excess Telecom shall pay KonaTel the additional sum of 5,000,000 (the ACP
Renewal Earnout), less the balance of a Finder s Fee Payment to an unrelated third party of approximately 125,000.
No assurance can be given that the ACP Program will be renewed by the FCC on or prior to December 31, 2024. 

See the Hyperlinked 8-K
Current Report dated January 22, 2024 (Excess Telecom Membership Interest Purchase Agreement and related Agreements), filed with the SEC
on January 30, 2024, for additional information, in Part II, Other Information, Item 6, Exhibits, hereof. 

Comparison of the three (3) months ended September
30, 2024, to the three (3) months ended September 30, 2023 

For the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024,
we had 3,148,409 in revenues from operations compared to 4,689,001 for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2023, for a total revenue
decrease of 1,540,592). The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the loss of mobile services revenues under the ACP Program, which
last funded in Q2 2024. 

For the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024,
our cost of revenue was 2,439,037 compared to 3,424,832 in the three (3) months ended September 30, 2023, for a cost of revenue decrease
of 985,795). Our cost of revenue decrease was a result of lower network, sales compensation and device costs, related to the activity
decreases from our Mobile Services subscribers. 

For the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024,
we had gross profit of 709,372 compared to 1,264,169 in the three (3) months ended September 30, 2023, for a gross profit decrease of 554,797). This decrease primarily resulted from adding fewer higher ARPU activations in our Mobile Services segment, due to the loss
of mobile services revenues under the ACP Program. 

For the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024,
total operating expenses were 1,896,592 compared to 1,133,106 in the three (3) months ended September 30, 2023, for an increase of 763,486.
This increase was primarily due to a reversal of stock option expense as the result of employee forfeitures of incentive stock options
taken in Q3 2023. Additionally, there was an increase in payroll and related expense associated with the addition of headcount in our
Apeiron subsidiary. 

For the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024,
other income (expense) was (1,694) compared to (244,279) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily the result
of no longer owing interest following the payoff of the CCUR loan. 

For the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024,
we had net loss of (1,188,914) compared to a net loss of 113,216) in the three (3) months ended September 30, 2023. 

Comparison of the nine (9) months ended September
30, 2024, to the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023 

For the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
we had 13,127,425 in revenues from operations compared to 13,322,146 for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023, for a total revenue
decrease of (194,721). The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the loss of mobile services revenues under the ACP Program, which
last funded in Q2 2024. Revenues in our Hosted Services segment increased 14.6 , or approximately 622,616, by comparison during this
same period, generally driven by higher volume contracted voice minutes and from the addition of new LTE Wireless WAN solutions customers. 

For the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
our cost of revenue was 10,390,841 compared to 10,282,046 in the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023, for a cost of revenue increase
of 108,795. Our cost of revenue increase was primarily the result of higher network, sales compensation and device costs, related to
a higher level of activity from Mobile Services subscribers. 

For the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
we had gross profit of 2,736,584 compared to 3,040,100 in the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023, for a gross profit decrease
of (303,517). This decrease primarily resulted from adding fewer, higher ARPU subscribers, due to the ACP program expiring, and higher
network costs. 

18 

For the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
total operating expenses were 6,025,121 compared to 4,605,779 in the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023, for an increase of 1,419,342.
This increase was impacted by a reversal of stock option expense as the result of employee forfeitures of incentive stock options taken
in Q3 2023, in addition to increases in payroll and related expense associated with additive headcount in our Apeiron subsidiary, as
well as increases in consulting fees. 

For the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
other income (expense) was 9,073,010 compared to (684,954) in the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was a result
of the gain on sale recognized as part of the sale of 49 interest in IM Telecom. 

For the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
we had net income of 5,784,473 compared to a net loss of 2,250,633) in the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,688,303 in cash
and cash equivalents on hand. 

In comparing liquidity between the nine (9) month
period ending September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, cash increased by 245.9 . This increase is the result of cash received as part
of the sale of 49 interest in IM Telecom. Liabilities and total overall debt decreased by 54.6 in the nine (9) month period ended September
30, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023, as part of the funds received with the sale of the 49 interest in IM Telecom were used
by the Company to pay all material debt obligations then outstanding. 

Our current ratio (current assets divided by our current
liabilities) increased to 1.92 as of September 30, 2024, compared to .48 as of December 31, 2023. Working capital increased by 178.8 . 

Cash Flow from Operations 

During the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
cash flow used in operating activities was 3,983,809), primarily as a result of debt and other obligations which were paid off as part
of a condition to the 49 sale of IM Telecom, as well as a note receivable resulting from the same sale of IM Telecom. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

During the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
cash flow provided by investing activities was 9,558,509, as a result of the gain on sale of IM Telecom. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

During the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
cash flow used in financing activities was 3,663,500), primarily as a result of repayments of outstanding notes payable. 

Going Concern 

For the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company generated net income of 5,784,473, compared to a net loss for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2023, of 2,250,633).
The Company sold a 49 interest in IM Telecom, which allowed the business to pay off all outstanding debt and retain additive cash. The
accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024, is 6,454,218). 

We are one of only a few telecommunication carriers
to hold a national wireless ETC Lifeline license, which provides us with additive reimbursement rates within the states we operate. In
Q2 2024, we added an additional ten (10) state licenses, which continues to expand our nationally licensed wireless service coverage.
We have continued to target and expand into additional ETC licensed states. 

As of June 1, 2024, funding for the ACP Program ended,
which accounted for approximately 15 of our revenues in Q2 2024 and 33 of our revenues in Q1 2024. Legislative efforts to extend funding
remain within Congress, however, the decision to further fund the ACP Program (or a similar program) is still uncertain. In light of this
uncertainty, the Company took initial steps to reduce costs in Q2 2024 while discussions continued in Congress, and we moved resources
and focus in our mobile services segment to California. With the California Lifeline Program, through its additional state funding and
Linkup program, the business was able to retain continuity in the mobile services market. In Q3 2024, the Company received a cease and
desist letter from the State of California CPUC, specific to a marketing program by one of our master distribution partners. The inquiry
into this matter has impacted the timing of payments on our qualified claims (see the heading Concentration of Credit Risk 
below). 

19 

Through September 30, 2024, and with no visible progress
towards an extension of the ACP Program within Congress, the Company is in the process of further cost reduction measures, including reductions
within our workforce. Although the Company eliminated its outstanding debt and increased its cash position earlier in the year, uncertainty
around the ACP Program, the recent impact on our business in the State of California, and program launch timing for our VIVA-US and our
other ongoing health care sales initiatives will play significant roles in our ability to continue operations without more drastic reductions.
The lack of our success with any of these foregoing initiatives raises substantial doubt about our ability to remain a going concern for
twelve (12) month period from the date of this Quarterly Report. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We had no Off-Balance Sheet arrangements during the
nine (9) month period ending September 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Earnings Per Share 

We follow ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings
per share. Basic earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods
when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of receivables, cash and cash equivalents. 

All cash and cash equivalents are held at high credit
financial institutions. These deposits are generally insured under the FDIC s deposit insurance coverage; however, from time to
time, the deposit levels may exceed FDIC coverage levels. 

The Company has a concentration of risk with respect
to trade receivables from customers and cellular providers. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a significant concentration of receivables
(defined as customers whose receivable balances are greater than 10 of total receivables) due from two (2) customers in the amount of
 1,369,032 or 73.3 , and 192,508 or 10.3 . It should be noted that the largest customer is the State of California,
and the second largest customer is the federal government, as administered by USAC, under the authority of the FCC. As of December 31,
2023, the Company had a significant concentration of receivables from two (2) customers in the amounts of 1,024,308 or 68.5 , and
 285,536 or 19.0 . 

Concentration of Major Customer 

A significant amount of the revenue is derived from
contracts with major customers. For the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had three (3) customers that accounted
for 953,260 or 30.3 , 665,665 or 21.1 and 617,440 or 19.6 of revenue, respectively. For the (3) three months
ended September 30, 2023, the Company had two (2) customers that accounted for 2,793,313 or 59.6 and 772,614 or 16.5 
of revenue, respectively. 

Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements
and believes that none will have a significant effect on the Company s financial statements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Management s Quarterly Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is
made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September
30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 

(i) On July 29, 2024, the Company received a cease
and desist notice from the State of California Public Utilities Commission CPUC ). The cause of the notice was identified
as an improperly conducted SMS messaging campaign by one of our distribution channels. Upon receiving the notice, the Company took immediate
action to identify the source of the complaint and eliminated the SMS messaging campaign associated with the specific distribution channel.
The Company will continue conversations with the CPUC to ensure all marketing campaigns comply. As noted above, California is the largest
open receivable as of September 30, 2024. Due to the ongoing cease and desist notice and related inquiry regarding the SMS messaging campaign,
payments from California have been delayed, and could cause cash distress to the business going forward. 

(ii) No director or Section 16 officer or a
trading arrangement intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or a non-Rule 10b5 1 
trading arrangement during the periods reported in this Quarterly Report. 

(iii) Effective November 8, 2024, the Board
of Directors amended the Insider Trading Policy of the Company to exempt from the Black-Out Periods therein the exercise
of stock options by the conveyance to the Company of fully-paid shares of common stock of the Company that are owned by the holder of
the stock options in payment of any exercise price of the stock options, based upon the closing price of such common stock on a nationally
recognized market for the trading of the Company s common stock, under any equity, pension or stock option plan or stock option
agreement, provided that the subject stock options will expire during the Black-Out Periods if not exercised. The Board of Directors also
changed the Compliance Officer to Brain R. Riffle, the Company s CFO. See Exhibit 99.1 in Part II, Item 6, Exhibits,

KONATEL, INC. KTEL 

INSIDER TRADING POLICY 

1) General Purpose 

Federal securities laws prohibit the purchase or sale of securities
by persons who are aware of material nonpublic information about a company, as well as the disclosure of material, nonpublic information
about a company to others who then trade in the company s securities. These transactions are commonly known as insider trading. 

Insider trading violations are heavily pursued by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney Offices and are punished. While the regulatory authorities concentrate their efforts on
individuals who trade, or who provide inside information to others who trade, the Federal securities laws also impose potential liability
on companies and other controlling persons if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel. 

The Board of Directors of KonaTel, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
has adopted this Insider Trading Policy (the Policy both to satisfy its obligation to prevent insider trading and to help
its personnel avoid the consequences associated with violations of the insider trading laws. For purposes of this policy, the Company 
includes KonaTel, Inc. and its subsidiaries KonaTel ). 

This Policy is also intended to prevent even the appearance
of improper conduct on the part of anyone employed by or associated with us, not just so-called insiders. Everyone within
KonaTel has worked very hard to establish KonaTel as a company known for integrity and ethical conduct, and therefore cannot afford to
have that reputation damaged. 

A copy of this Policy is to be delivered to all current and
new employees and consultants upon the commencement of their relationships with KonaTel and its subsidiaries. 

2) Persons Covered 

This Policy refers to an insider and we wish
to define it herein. Insiders of KonaTel, Inc. are defined as (a) members of our Board of Directors, corporate officers and employees;
(b) consultants to KonaTel and subsidiaries or other persons associated with KonaTel and/or its subsidiaries, including distributors,
sales agents or other partners that may, in the course of their work with KonaTel, receive access to confidential, material non-public
information; and (c) household and immediate family members of those listed in (a) and (b) above. 

3) Definitions 

A) Material non-public information : Material non-public
information is defined to be information that is not known to persons outside the immediate company that could be relied upon or considered
significant to an investor making a decision to buy or sell KonaTel securities. It is currently very difficult to define each and every
category under this heading. However, any information that should be considered sensitive and non-public material includes but is not
limited to the following: 

a. Financial results; 

b. Future Earnings or Losses; 

c. News of a pending or proposed sale, merger or acquisition; 

d. Acquisitions, Mergers or Divestitures; 

e. Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems; 

f. Major changes in senior management; 

g. Stock dividends or splits; 

h. New equity or debt offerings; 

i. Large contracts in a pending status or in discussion. 

Remember , anyone who is reviewing your securities transactions
will be doing so after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight. As such, before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully consider
how the others might view the transaction. 

B) Black-Out Periods : A Black-Out Period 
is a time before and after a significant event wherein an insider may not buy or sell KonaTel securities without violating this Policy. 

There are four Black-Out Periods for insiders of KonaTel. These
include twenty (20) days prior to the release of financial results for the periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December
31 of each year and end after three (3) full trading days of KonaTel (KTEL) securities on the OTCQB (or any other recognized nation medium
of which KonaTel (KTEL) securities publicly trade [ Other Medium ]) after the results are announced for the preceding fiscal
period. If the last day of the month falls on a weekend, the Black-Out Period will start at the close of business on the last trading
day prior to the weekend. 

Additional Black-Out Periods may occur when other material events
occur, such as a press release sent out to the public, wherein only a select few persons have knowledge of the event. If you are one of
these individuals, or if it would appear to an outsider that you were likely to have had access to such information related to the event,
then you will not be allowed to purchase or sell KonaTel securities so long as the event remains non-public information and for three
(3) full trading days of KonaTel, Inc. securities on the OTCBB or Other Medium after the event is made public. 

Also, KonaTel may occasionally issue interim earnings guidance
or other potentially material information by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 8-K or by other means designed
to achieve widespread dissemination of the information. You should anticipate that trades are unlikely to be pre-cleared while KonaTel
is in the process of assembling the information to be released and until the information has been released and fully absorbed by the public
market. The existence of an additional Black-Out Period will not be announced. If you request pre-clearance of a transaction in KonaTel s
securities during an additional Black-Out Period, you will be informed of the existence of a Black-Out Period, but you may not be advised
of the reason for the Black-Out Period. 

If you are made aware of the existence of an additional Black-Out
Period, you should not disclose the existence of the Black-Out Period to any other person. Whether or not you are designated as being
subject to an additional Black-Out Period, you still have the obligation not to purchase or sell KonaTel securities while you are aware
of the material non-public information. 

KonaTel, Inc. Proprietary Confidential Insider Trading Policy Page 2 of 5 Ver 11/8/24 

C) Securities : Securities of KonaTel are defined as
common stock, preferred stock, options to purchase stock, warrants, convertible debt and/or derivative securities. 

Except as otherwise provided herein, these Black-Out Periods
do not apply to the exercise of Stock Option Agreements for Rule 144 common stock of KonaTel that are issued by KonaTel, or other stock
issuances approved by the Board of Directors; however, they do apply to all KonaTel securities that are the subject of a registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

4) Policy 

A) No insider may buy or sell KonaTel securities at any time
when they have material non-public information relating to KonaTel. 

B) No insider may buy or sell securities of another company
at any time when they have material non-public information about that company, including, without limitation, any company that we conduct
ordinary business with, such as customers, vendors, or suppliers, when that information is obtained during the course of his/her employment
with KonaTel or its subsidiaries. 

C) No insider may disclose material non-public information
to third parties, to any other person, including family members, or make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of material
non-public information with regard to trading securities. 

D) No insider who receives or has access to our material non-public
information may comment on the stock price movement or rumors of other corporate developments that are of possible significance to the
investing public, unless it is part of his/her job description (e.g., Investor Relations) or you have been specifically pre-authorized
by the KonaTel CEO or CFO in each instance. 

E) If you comment on stock price movement or rumors and/or
disclose material non-public information, you should immediately contact KonaTel s Chief Compliance Officer. 

F) No insider may buy or sell our securities during any of
the four Black-Out Periods that occur each fiscal year or any other Black-Out Period. 

G) This Policy continues in effect until the end of the first
Black-Out Period after termination of employment or other relationship with KonaTel or its subsidiaries. 

5) Special Rules 

If a concern or question relating to your status within KonaTel
(insider or not, etc.) should arise, please contact the Chief Compliance Officer.

Officer.

from time to time by KonaTel s Compliance Officer. 

a. In addition to the restrictions related to the trading
of KonaTel securities as defined in Section 4 above, insiders shall not:

options in payment of any exercise price of the stock options under any equity, pension or stock option plan or stock option agreement,
provided that the subject stock options will expire during the Black-Out Periods if not exercised; or any other plan later defined (but
 not the public sale of such shares), since the market price does not affect the exercise price stated in the agreement. 

7) Potential Criminal and/or Civil Liability and/or Disciplinary
Action 

The items set forth in this Policy are simply to be viewed
as guidelines, not as comprehensive coverage of all potential instances. Appropriate judgment should be exercised by each individual in
connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 

KonaTel, Inc. Proprietary Confidential Insider Trading Policy Page 4 of 5 Ver 11/8/24 

Insiders found liable for insider trading may be subject to
criminal penalties of up to 1,000,000 and up to ten (10) years in jail for trading of securities based on material non-public information.
In addition, insiders may also be liable for conducting transactions improperly by any person to whom they have disclosed the material
non-public information. The Securities and Exchange Commission has imposed large penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit,
directly or indirectly, from the trade(s). There are also civil penalties of up to three (3) times the profit gained, or loss avoided,
that may be imposed. 

 KonaTel and controlling persons of KonaTel may also be found
liable for insider trading by any insider, and accordingly all purchases and sale of KonaTel by insiders must be made within the terms
and conditions of this Policy and must be first submitted to the Chief Compliance Officer. 

Furthermore, any employees who are found in violation of this
Policy will be subject to disciplinary action as outlined in the Employee Handbook, including ineligibility of future participation in
equity incentive plans or termination of employment.

as the Chief Compliance Officer. Mr. Riffle s telephone number is 814-535-4017; and his e-mail address is briffle@cfostratllc.com .
