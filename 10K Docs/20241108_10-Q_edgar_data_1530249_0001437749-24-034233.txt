full-service bank branches, a headquarters that also originates loans and accepts deposits, and loan production offices in suburban communities in the greater Puget Sound area, the Kennewick-Pasco-Richland metropolitan area of Washington, also known as the Tri-Cities, Goldendale, Vancouver, and White Salmon, Washington and Manzanita, Newport, Ontario, Tillamook, and Waldport, Oregon. The Bank s branches located in the communities of Goldendale and White Salmon, Washington and Manzanita, Newport, Ontario, Tillamook, and Waldport, Oregon were acquired from Columbia State Bank on February 24, 2023, and opened as 1st Security Bank branches on February 27, 2023. The Bank provides loan and deposit services to customers who are predominantly small- and middle-market businesses and individuals. The Company and its subsidiary are subject to regulation by certain federal and state agencies and undergo periodic examination by these regulatory agencies. 

business segments through the Bank: commercial and consumer banking and home lending. The Company s business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, as well as the nature of the related business activities, and they reflect the way financial information is regularly reviewed for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating performance of the Company s businesses. The results for these business segments are based on management s accounting process, which assigns income statement items and assets to each responsible operating segment. This process is dynamic and is based on management s view of the Company s operations. See Note 14 Business Segments. 

The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023 - 09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Application of New Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2024 On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted ASU No.2022 - 03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820 ): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . ASU 2022 - 03 clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered in measuring fair value, nor should the contractual restriction be recognized and measured separately. Further, this ASU requires disclosure of the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions reflected in the balance sheet, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions(s), and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restriction(s). ASU 2022 - 03 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2022 - 03 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2023 - 02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323 ): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method, a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force . ASU 2023 - 02 allows an entity the option to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting to other equity investments that are made for the primary purpose of receiving tax credits or other income tax benefits if certain conditions are met. Prior to this ASU, the application of the proportional amortization method of accounting was limited to investments in low-income housing tax credit structures. The proportional amortization method of accounting results in the amortization of applicable investments, as well as the related income tax credits or other income tax benefits received, being presented on a single line in the statements of income, income tax expense. Under this ASU, an entity has the option to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting to applicable investments on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit program basis. In addition, the amendments in this ASU require that all tax equity investments accounted for using the proportional amortization method use the delayed equity contribution guidance in paragraph 323 - 740 - 25 - 3, requiring a liability to be recognized for delayed equity contributions that are unconditional and legally binding or for equity contributions that are contingent upon a future event when that contingent event becomes probable. Under this ASU, low-income housing tax credit investments for which the proportional amortization method is not applied can no longer be accounted for using the delayed equity contribution guidance. Further, this ASU specifies that impairment of low-income housing tax credit investments not accounted for using the equity method must apply the impairment guidance in Subtopic 323 - 10: Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures - Overall. This ASU also clarifies that for low-income housing tax credit investments not accounted for under the proportional amortization method or the equity method, an entity shall account for them under Topic 321: Investments - Equity Securities . The amendments in the ASU also require additional disclosures in interim and annual periods concerning investments for which the proportional amortization method is applied, including (i) the nature of tax equity investments, and (ii) the effect of tax equity investments and related income tax credits and other income tax benefits on the financial position and results of operations. ASU 2023 - 02 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2023 - 02 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on an individual basis. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and was million and million on available-for-sale debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Accrued interest receivable on securities is reported in Accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is excluded from the calculation of the ACL. 
 
 The Company monitors the credit quality of debt securities held-to-maturity quarterly using credit rating, material event notices, and changes in market value. The following table summarizes the amortized cost of debt securities held-to-maturity at the dates indicated, aggregated by credit quality indicator: 

BB+ 
 Total 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were debt securities held-to-maturity that were classified as either nonaccrual or 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. 
 
 The following table presents, as of September 30, 2024 , investment securities which were pledged to secure borrowings, public deposits or other obligations as permitted or required by law: 

Investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position at the dates indicated are presented in the following tables, based on the length of time individual securities have been in an unrealized loss position.

There were held-to-maturity debt securities in an unrealized loss position of less than one year and held-to-maturity debt securities in an unrealized loss position of more than one year at September 30, 2024 . 
 
 There were available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position of less than one year, and available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position of more than one year at September 30, 2024 . The unrealized losses associated with these securities are believed to be caused by changing market conditions and considered to be temporary, and the Company does not intend and is not likely to be required to sell these securities prior to maturity. Management monitors the published credit ratings of the issuers of the debt securities for material ratings or outlook changes. Substantially all the Company s municipal bond portfolio is comprised of obligations of states and political subdivisions located within the Company s geographic footprint that are monitored through quarterly or annual financial review utilizing published credit ratings. All the municipal bond securities are investment grade. 
 
 All the available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Small Business Administration securities in an unrealized loss position are issued or guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, and the available-for-sale corporate securities are all investment grade and monitored for rating or outlook changes. Based on the Company s evaluation of these securities, credit impairment was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , or for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 

The contractual maturities of securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity at the dates indicated are listed below. Expected maturities of mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the obligations; therefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date.

Accrued interest receivable on loans was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and was reported in Accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Most of the Company s CRE and multi-family real estate, construction, residential, and/or commercial business lending activities are with customers located in Western Washington, the Oregon Coast, or near our loan production offices in Vancouver and the Tri-Cities, Washington. The Company originates real estate, consumer, and commercial business loans and has concentrations in these areas, however, indirect home improvement loans, including solar-related home improvement loans, are originated through a network of home improvement contractors and dealers located throughout Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, Texas, Utah, Massachusetts, Montana, and New Hampshire. Loans are generally secured by collateral and rights to collateral vary and are legally documented to the extent practicable. Local economic conditions may affect borrowers ability to meet the stated repayment terms. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , the Bank held approximately billion in loans that are pledged as collateral for FHLB borrowings, compared to approximately billion at December 31, 2023 . The Bank held approximately million in loans that are pledged as collateral for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB line of credit at September 30, 2024 , compared to approximately million at December 31, 2023 . 

The Company has defined its loan portfolio into three segments that reflect the structure of the lending function, the Company s strategic plan and the way management monitors performance and credit quality. The three loan portfolio segments are: (a) real estate, (b) consumer, and (c) commercial business. Each of these segments is disaggregated into classes based on the risk characteristics of the borrower and/or the collateral type securing the loan. The following is a summary of each of the Company s loan portfolio segments and classes: 
 
 Real Estate Loans 
 
 One-to-Four-Family Real Estate Lending . One-to- four -family residential loans include owner occupied properties (including second homes), and non-owner-occupied properties with four or less units. These loans originated by the Company or periodically purchased from banks are secured by first mortgages on one -to- four -family residences in our market areas that the Company intends to hold (excludes loans held for sale). 
 
 Multi-Family Lending . Apartment term lending five or more units) to current banking customers and community reinvestment loans for low to moderate income individuals in the Company s footprint. 
 
 CRE Lending . Loans originated by the Company primarily secured by income-producing properties, including retail centers, warehouses, and office buildings located in our market areas. 
 
 Construction and Development Lending . Loans originated by the Company for the construction of, and secured by, commercial real estate, one -to- four -family, and multi-family residences and tracts of land for development that are not pre-sold. A portion of the one -to- four -family construction portfolio is custom construction loans to the intended occupant of the residence. 
 
 Home Equity Lending . Loans originated by the Company secured by second mortgages on one -to- four -family residences, including home equity lines of credit in our market areas. 
 
 Consumer Loans 
 
 Indirect Home Improvement . Fixture secured loans for home improvement are originated by the Company through its network of home improvement contractors and dealers and are secured by the personal property installed in, on, or at the borrower s real property, and may be perfected with a UCC 2 financing statement filed in the county of the borrower s residence. These indirect home improvement loans include replacement windows, siding, roofing, spas, and other home fixture installations, including solar related home improvement projects. 
 
 Marine . Loans originated by the Company, secured by boats, to borrowers primarily located in states where the Company originates consumer loans. 
 
 Other Consumer . Loans originated by the Company to consumers in our retail branch footprint, including automobiles, recreational vehicles, direct home improvement loans, loans on deposits, and other consumer loans, primarily consisting of personal lines of credit and credit cards. 
 
 Commercial Business Loans 
 
 C I Lending. C I loans originated by the Company to local small- and mid-sized businesses in our Puget Sound market area are secured primarily by accounts receivable, inventory, or personal property, plant and equipment. Some C I loans purchased by the Company are outside of the greater Puget Sound market area. C I loans are made based on the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , C I loans included Small Business Administration and United States Department of Agriculture guaranteed certificates of million and million, respectively. 
 
 Warehouse Lending . Loans originated to non-depository financial institutions and secured by notes originated by the non-depository financial institution. The Company has two distinct warehouse lending divisions: commercial warehouse re-lending secured by notes on construction loans and mortgage warehouse re-lending secured by notes on one -to- four -family loans. The Company s commercial construction warehouse lines are secured by notes on construction loans and typically guaranteed by principals with experience in construction lending. Mortgage warehouse lending loans are funded through third -party residential mortgage bankers. Under this program the Company provides short-term funding to the mortgage banking companies for the purpose of originating residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The main reason for the provision for credit losses on loans recorded in the first nine months of 2024 was elevated net charge-offs.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans . Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are automatically placed on nonaccrual once the loan is 90 days past due or sooner if, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, or as required by regulatory authorities. 

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 The Company may modify the contractual terms of a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a part of ongoing loss mitigation strategies. These modifications may result in an interest rate reduction, term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a combination thereof. The Company typically does not offer principal forgiveness. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. The effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the ACL on loans because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance. 
 
 The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans that were modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty at the end of the reporting periods by loan class and modification type. 
 
 Deferred payments and capitalized interest for a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.

 CRE Deferred payments and capitalized interest for a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. 

Reduced weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.5 to 4.1 , and added a weighted-average 5 years to the life of the loans. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the modified loans were in compliance with their modified terms and were classified as current. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , loans experienced a default subsequent to being granted a modification in the last twelve months. There were unfunded commitments associated with loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial distress as of September 30, 2024 .

Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 As part of the Company s on-going monitoring of credit quality of the loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to (i) the risk grading of loans, (ii) the level of classified loans, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) non-performing loans, and (v) the general economic conditions in the Company s markets. 
 
 The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to its real estate and commercial business loans. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 10, with loans in risk grades 1 to 6 reported as Pass and loans in risk grades 7 to 10 reported as classified loans in the Company s ACL analysis. 
 
 A description of the 10 risk grades is as follows: 
 
 Grades 1 and 2 - These grades include loans to very high-quality borrowers with excellent or desirable business credit. 

Grade 3 - This grade includes loans to borrowers of good business credit with moderate risk. 

Grades 4 and 5 - These grades include Pass grade loans to borrowers of average credit quality and risk. 

Grade 6 - This grade includes loans on management s Watch list and is intended to be utilized on a temporary basis for Pass grade borrowers where frequent and thorough monitoring is required due to credit weaknesses and where significant risk-modifying action is anticipated in the near term. 

Grade 7 - This grade is for Other Assets Especially Mentioned OAEM or Special Mention in accordance with regulatory guidelines and includes borrowers where performance is poor or significantly less than expected. 

Grade 8 - This grade includes Substandard loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines which represent an unacceptable business credit where a loss is possible if loan weakness is not corrected. 

Grade 9 - This grade includes Doubtful loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines where a loss is highly probable. 

Grade 10 - This grade includes Loss loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines for which total loss is expected and when identified are charged off. 

Homogeneous loans are risk rated based upon the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council s Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy. Loans classified under this policy at the Company are consumer loans which include indirect home improvement, solar, marine, other consumer, and one -to- four -family first and second liens. Under the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy, loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are graded Pass and risk rated 4 or 5 internally. Loans that are past due more than 90 days are classified Substandard and risk graded 8 internally until the loan has demonstrated consistent performance, typically six months of contractual payments. Closed-end loans that are 120 days past due and open-end loans that are 180 days past due are charged off based on the value of the collateral less cost to sell. Management may choose to conservatively risk rate credits even if paying in accordance with the loan s repayment terms. 
 
 CRE, construction and development, multi-family and commercial business loans are evaluated individually for their risk classification and may be classified as Substandard even if current on their loan payment obligations. We regularly review our credits for accuracy of risk grades whenever we receive new information. Borrowers are generally required to submit financial information at regular intervals. Typically, commercial borrowers with lines of credit are required to submit financial information with reporting intervals ranging from monthly to annually depending on credit size, risk, and complexity. In addition, nonowner-occupied CRE borrowers with loans exceeding a certain dollar threshold are usually required to submit rent rolls or property income statements annually. We monitor construction loans monthly. We also review loans graded Watch or worse, regardless of loan type, no less than quarterly. 

The following tables summarize risk rated loan balances and total current period gross charge-offs by category, as of the dates indicated. Term loans that were renewed or extended for periods longer than 90 days are presented as new originations in the year of the most recent renewal or extension.

 Ending balance, at the lower of cost or fair value 

The fair value of the MSRs assets was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Fair value adjustments to MSRs are mainly due to market-based assumptions associated with discounted cash flows, loan prepayment speeds, and changes in interest rates. A significant change in prepayments of the loans in the MSRs portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of MSRs. 
 
 The following provides valuation assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs at the dates indicated: 

Conditional prepayment rate CPR 
 Weighted average life in years 

Key economic assumptions of the current fair value for single family MSRs are presented in the table below. Also presented is the sensitivity to market rate changes for the par rate coupon for a conventional one -to- four -family FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, or FHLB serviced home loan. The table below references a basis point and basis point adverse rate change and the impact on prepayment speeds and discount rates at the dates indicated:

 Percentage of MSRs 
 
 Discount rate 
 Fair value MSRs 
 Percentage of MSRs 

Fair value MSRs 
 Percentage of MSRs 
 
 Discount rate 
 Fair value MSRs 
 Percentage of MSRs 

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution as the tables above demonstrate the Company s methodology for estimating the fair value of MSRs which is extremely sensitive to changes in key assumptions. For example, actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value of MSRs. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in these tables, the effects of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may be associated with changes in another (for example, decreases in market interest rates may provide an incentive to refinance, however, this may also indicate a slowing economy and an increase in the unemployment rate, which reduces the number of borrowers who qualify for refinancing), which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Thus, any measurement of the fair value of MSRs is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made at a particular point in time. Those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different time. 
 
 The Company recorded million and million of gross contractually specified servicing fees, late fees, and other ancillary fees resulting from servicing of loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The income, net of amortization of MSRs, is reported in Service charges and fee income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to variability in interest-related cash outflows attributable to changes in forecasted Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR based brokered deposits. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The hedged item is the SOFR portion of the series of future adjustable-rate borrowings and deposits over the term of the interest rate swap. Accordingly, changes to the amount of interest payment cash flows for the hedged transactions attributable to a change in credit risk are excluded from management s assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company tests for hedging effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The accumulated other comprehensive income is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The Company has not recorded any hedge ineffectiveness since inception. 
 
 The Company expects that approximately million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as a decrease to interest expense over the next 12 months related to these cash flow hedges. 
 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 
 The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its pools of prepayable fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate, the SOFR. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. 
 
 The following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative-basis adjustment for fair value hedges for the dates indicated:

At September 30, 2024 , the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was million; the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was million; and the amounts of the designated hedged items was million. 

The following tables summarize the Company s derivative instruments at the dates indicated. The Company recognizes derivative assets and liabilities in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as follows:

 The Company has derivative contracts with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision to post collateral to the counterparties when these contracts are in a net liability position. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had million of collateral posted due to this provision. Receivables related to cash collateral that has been paid to counterparties is included in Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Total commitments to extend credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the amount of the total commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon an extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing commercial properties. 

Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines, and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit usually do not contain a specified maturity date and ultimately may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. The Company s ACL unfunded loan commitments at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million. The Company recorded recoveries for credit losses unfunded loan commitments of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to a recovery from the ACL of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The Company also sells one -to- four -family loans to the FHLB of Des Moines that require a limited level of recourse if the loans default and exceed a certain loss exposure. Specific to that recourse, the FHLB of Des Moines established a first loss account FLA related to the loans and required a credit enhancement CE obligation by the Bank to be utilized after the FLA is used. Based on loans sold through September 30, 2024 , total loans serviced on behalf of the FHLB of Des Moines were million with the FLA totaling and the CE obligation at or of the loans outstanding. Management has established a holdback of of the outstanding CE, or , which is a part of the off-balance sheet holdback for loans sold. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were loans sold and serviced on behalf of the FHLB of Des Moines that were greater than 90 days past their contractual payment due date. 
 
 Contingent liabilities for loans held for sale In the ordinary course of business, loans are sold with limited recourse against the Company and may have to subsequently be repurchased due to defects that occurred during the origination of the loan. The defects are categorized as documentation errors, underwriting errors, early payoff, early payment defaults, breach of representation or warranty, servicing errors, and/or fraud. When a loan sold to an investor without recourse fails to perform according to its contractual terms, the investor will typically review the loan file to determine whether defects in the origination process occurred. If a defect is identified, the Company may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the investor for losses sustained. If there are no such defects, the Company has no commitment to repurchase the loan. The Company has recorded a holdback reserve of million and million to cover loss exposure related to these guarantees for one -to- four -family loans sold into the secondary market at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The Company has entered into a severance agreement with its Chief Executive Officer CEO ). The severance agreement, subject to certain requirements, generally includes a lump sum payment to the CEO equal to 24 months of base compensation in the event his employment is involuntarily terminated, other than for cause or the executive terminates his employment with good reason, as defined in the severance agreement. 
 
 The Company has entered into change of control agreements with its executives and select key personnel. The change of control agreements, subject to certain requirements, generally remain in effect until canceled by either party upon at least 24 months prior written notice. Under the change of control agreements, the executive generally will be entitled to a change of control payment from the Company if the executive is involuntarily terminated within six months preceding or 12 months after a change in control (as defined in the change of control agreements). In such an event, the executives would each be entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to 12 months of their then current salary, subject to certain requirements in the change of control agreements. 
 
 As a result of the nature of our activities, the Company is subject to various pending and threatened legal actions, which arise in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, subordination liens may create litigation which requires us to defend our lien rights. In the opinion of management, liabilities arising from these claims, if any, will not have a material effect on our financial position. The Company had no material pending legal actions at September 30, 2024 . 

Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
 
 Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
 
 The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities on a recurring and nonrecurring basis: 
 
 Securities The fair value of securities available-for-sale are recorded on a recurring basis. The fair value of investments and mortgage-backed securities are provided by a third -party pricing service. These valuations are based on market data using pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available current trade, bid, and other market information, and for structured securities, cash flow, and loan performance data. The pricing processes utilize benchmark curves, benchmarking of similar securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. Option adjusted spread models are also used to assess the impact of changes in interest rates and to develop prepayment scenarios (Level 2 ). Transfers between the fair value hierarchy are determined through the third -party service provider which, from time to time will transfer between levels based on market conditions per the related security. All models and processes used consider market convention. 
 
 Mortgage Loans Held for Sale The fair value of loans held for sale reflects the value of commitments with investors and/or the relative price as delivered into a TBA mortgage-backed security (Level 2 ). 
 
 Loans Receivable Certain residential mortgage loans were initially originated for sale and measured at fair value; after origination, the loans were transferred to loans held for investment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were million and million, respectively, in residential mortgage loans recorded at fair value as they were previously transferred from held for sale, at fair value to loans held for investment. The aggregate unpaid principal balance of these loans was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Gains and losses from changes in fair value for these loans are reported in earnings as a component of Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded a net increase in fair value of , as compared to a net decrease in fair value of for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded a net increase in fair value of , as compared to a net decrease in fair value of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . For loans originated as held for sale and transferred into loans held for investment, the fair value is determined based on quoted secondary market prices for similar loans (Level 2 ). 
 
 Derivative Instruments Fair values for derivative assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis. The primary use of derivative instruments is related to the mortgage banking activities of the Company. The fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and forward sales commitments are estimated using quoted or published market prices for similar instruments, adjusted for factors such as pull-though rate assumptions based on historical information, where appropriate. TBA mortgage-backed securities are fair valued on similar contracts in active markets (Level 2 ), while locks and forwards with customers and investors are fair valued using similar contracts in the market and changes in the market interest rates (Level 2 and 3 ). Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking activities include interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2 ). The Company s derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of the market inputs we use are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including market transactions and third -party pricing services. The fair values of all interest rate swaps are determined from third -party pricing services without adjustment. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned Fair value adjustments to OREO are recorded at the lower of carrying amount of the loan or fair value of the collateral less selling costs. Any write-downs based on the asset s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the ACL on loans. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell (Level 3 ). 

Collateral Dependent Loans Expected credit losses on collateral dependent loans are measured based on the fair value of collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will recognize an allowance as the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell (if applicable) at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan, any expected recovery added to the amortized cost basis will be limited to the amount previously charged-off by the subsequent changes in the expected credit losses on collateral dependent loans. Subsequent adjustments in the expected credit losses for collateral-dependent loans are included within the provision for credit losses in the same way the expected credit loss initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported (Level 3 ). 
 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair value of MSRs is estimated using net present value of expected cash flows using a third -party model that incorporates assumptions used in the industry to value such rights, adjusted for factors such as weighted average prepayments speeds based on historical information where appropriate (Level 3 ).

million shares of the Company s common stock to be awarded. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, and up to shares as restricted stock awards RSAs to directors, emeritus directors, officers, employees or advisory directors of the Company. At September 30, 2024 , there were stock option awards and RSAs available for future grants under the 2018 Plan. 
 
 Total share-based compensation expense was and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Stock Options 
 
 The 2018 Plan consists of stock option awards that may be granted as incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Stock option awards generally vest over a one -year and two -year period for independent directors or over a five -year period for employees and officers with vesting on the anniversary date of each grant date as long as the award recipient remains in service to the Company. The options are exercisable after vesting for up to the remaining term of the original grant. The maximum term of the options granted is years. Any unexercised stock options will expire years after the grant date or sooner in the event of the award recipient s termination of service with the Company or the Bank. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes Option pricing model that uses the following assumptions. 
 
 The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of the grant date for the periods indicated: 
 
 Expected volatility 
 Risk-free interest rate 
 Expected term in years 
 Weighted-average grant date fair value per option granted 

The dividend yield is based on the current quarterly dividend in effect at the time of the grant. The historical volatility of the Company's stock price over a specified period of time is used for the expected volatility. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the comparable U.S. Treasury rate for the discount rate associated with the stock in effect on the date of the grant. The Company elected to use Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, simplified expected term calculation for the Share-Based Payments method permitted by the SEC to calculate the expected term. This method uses the vesting term of an option along with the contractual term, setting the expected life at years for one -year vesting, years for two -year vesting, and years for five -year vesting. 

The following table presents a summary of the Company s stock option awards during the dates indicated (shown as actual):

1 Forfeiture rate has been calculated and estimated, based on historical employment data, to assume a forfeiture of of the options over years. 

At September 30, 2024 , there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the 2018 Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of years. 
 
 Restricted Stock Awards 
 
 The RSAs fair value is equal to the value of the market price of FS Bancorp s common stock on the grant date and compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the restricted stock. Shares granted under the 2018 Plan generally vest over a one -year or two -year period for independent directors and a five -year period for employees and officers beginning on the grant date. Any nonvested RSAs will be forfeited in the event of the award recipient s termination of service with the Company or the Bank.

In addition to the minimum CET 1, Tier 1, total capital and leverage ratios, the Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET 1 capital greater than of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum capital levels to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. At September 30, 2024 , the Bank s capital exceeded the minimum required capital with the required conservation buffer. 
 
 The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies with less than 3.0 billion in assets are generally not subject to compliance with the Federal Reserve s capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to the Bank. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the holding company s subsidiary bank and expects the holding company s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If the Company were subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with 3.0 billion or more in assets at September 30, 2024 , it would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. For informational purposes, the regulatory capital ratios calculated for the Company at September 30, 2024 were for Tier 1 leverage-based capital, for Tier 1 risk-based capital, for total risk-based capital, and for CET 1 capital ratio. The regulatory capital ratios calculated for the Company at December 31, 2023 were for Tier 1 leverage-based capital, for Tier 1 risk-based capital, for total risk-based capital, and for CET 1 capital ratio. 

branches in the Pacific Northwest. This segment is also responsible for the management of the investment portfolio and other assets of the Bank. 

Home Lending Segment 
 
 The home lending segment originates one -to- four -family residential mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary markets as well as loans held for investment. A majority of these mortgage loans are sold to or securitized by FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, or the FHLB of Des Moines, while the Company generally retains the right to service these loans. Loans originated under the guidelines of the Federal Housing Administration FHA ), US Department of Veterans Affairs VA ), and United States Department of Agriculture USDA are generally sold servicing released to a correspondent bank or mortgage company. The Company has the option to sell loans on a servicing-released or servicing-retained basis to correspondent lenders. A small percentage of its loans are brokered to other lenders. On occasion, the Company may sell a portion of its MSRs portfolio and may sell small pools of loans initially originated to be held in the loan portfolio. The Company manages the loan funding and the interest rate risk associated with the secondary market loan sales and the retained one -to- four -family MSRs within this business segment. One-to- four -family loans originated for investment and held in this segment are allocated to the home lending segment with a corresponding provision expense and FTP for cost of funds.

1 Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of liabilities to fund those assets. Interest earned includes actual interest earned on segment assets and, if the segment has excess liabilities, interest credits for providing funding to the other segment. The cost of liabilities includes interest expense on segment liabilities and, if the segment does not have enough liabilities to fund its assets, a funding charge based on the cost of assigned liabilities to fund segment assets. 
 
 2 Noninterest income includes activity from certain residential mortgage loans that were initially originated for sale and measured at fair value, and subsequently transferred to loans held for investment. Gains and losses from changes in fair value for these loans are reported in earnings as a component of noninterest income. The Company recorded a net increase in fair value of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and a net decrease in fair value of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. As of three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there was million and million, respectively, in residential mortgage loans recorded at fair value as they were previously transferred from loans held for sale to loans held for investment. 
 
 3 Noninterest expense includes allocated overhead expense from general corporate activities. Allocation is determined based on a combination of segment assets and FTEs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Home Lending segment included allocated overhead expenses of million and million, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , of million and million, respectively. 

million at both September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , and represents the excess of the total acquisition price paid over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of the fair values of liabilities assumed in the Branch Purchase on February 24, 2023, and the purchase of four retail bank branches from Bank of America on January 22, 2016. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at December 31 of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performed an impairment analysis at December 31, 2023 , and determined that impairment of goodwill existed. 
 
 Core deposit intangible CDI is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any changes in estimated useful life accounted for prospectively over the revised remaining life. As of September 30, 2024 , management believes that there have been events or changes in the circumstances that would indicate a potential impairment of CDI. 
 
 The following table summarizes the changes in the Company s other intangible assets comprised solely of CDI for the year ended December 31, 2023 , and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

The Company originates one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans through referrals from real estate agents, financial planners, builders, and from existing customers. Retail banking customers are also an important source of the Company s loan originations. The Company originated 196.2 million of one-to-four-family loans (which included loans held for sale, loans held for investment and fixed seconds) in addition to 6.7 million of loans brokered to other institutions through the home lending segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024, of which 167.6 million were sold to investors. Of the loans sold to investors, 61.7 million were sold to the FNMA, FHLMC, FHLB, and/or GNMA with servicing rights retained for the purpose of further developing these customer relationships. At September 30, 2024, one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans held for investment totaled 591.7 million, or 23.7 , of the total gross loan portfolio, while loans held for sale totaled 49.4 million and residential home equity loans totaled 75.1 million at that date. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, one-to-four-family loan originations and refinancing activity increased compared to the prior quarter as a result of slightly decreased market interest rates and seasonal activity. Residential construction and development lending, while not as common as other loan origination options like one-to-four-family loans, continues to be an important element in our total loan portfolio, and we continue to take a disciplined approach by concentrating our efforts on loans to builders and developers in our market areas known to us. These short-term loans typically have a maturity period of six to 18 months, with disbursements not fully realized at origination, leading to a short-term reduction in net loans receivable. 
 
 The Company is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles. Sources of funds for lending activities include primarily deposits, including brokered deposits, borrowings, payments on loans, and income provided from operations.

The Company s earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense. Interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding during a given period and the yield earned on these loans and investments. Interest expense is a function of the amount of deposits and borrowings outstanding during the same period and interest rates paid on these deposits and borrowings. 
 
 The Company s earnings are also affected by fee income from mortgage banking activities, the provision for (recovery of) credit losses, service charges and fees, gains from sales of assets, operating expenses and income taxes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we must make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include the following: 
 
 ACL on Held-to-Maturity Securities. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities by individual security. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses considers credit ratings and historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 
 The held-to-maturity portfolio consists entirely of corporate securities. Securities are generally rated investment grade or higher. Securities are analyzed individually to establish a reserve. 
 
 ACL on Available-for-Sale Securities. For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, management first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not to be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For debt securities available-for-sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. 
 
 Changes in the ACL are recorded as a provision for (recapture of) credit losses. Losses are charged against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities is not included in the estimate of credit losses. 
 
 ACL on Loans. The ACL on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed and recaptures are credited to the ACL when received. In the case of recaptures, amounts may not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off. 
 
 Management utilizes relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, historical loss experience, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The lookback period in the analysis includes historical data from 2009 to present. Adjustments to historical loss information are made when management determines historical data is not likely reflective of the current portfolio such as limited data sets or lack of default or loss history. Management may selectively apply external market data to subjectively adjust the Company s own loss history including index or peer data. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses on loans. 
 
 The ACL on loans is measured on a collective cohort basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Generally, collectively assessed loans are grouped by call report code and then risk-grade grouping. Risk grade is grouped within each call report code by pass, watch, special mention, substandard, and doubtful. Other loan types are separated into their own cohorts due to specific risk characteristics for that pool of loans.

The Company has elected a non-discounted cash flow methodology with probability of default PD and loss given default LGD for all call report code cohorts cohorts ), except for the indirect and marine portfolios which are evaluated under a vintage methodology. The vintage methodology measures the expected loss calculation for future periods based on historical performance by the origination period of loans with similar life cycles and risk characteristics. Guaranteed portions of loans are measured with zero risk due to cash collateral and full government agency guaranty. 
 
 The PD calculation looks at the historical loan portfolio at points in time (each month during the lookback period) to determine the probability that loans in a certain cohort will default over the next 12-month period. A default is defined as a loan that has moved to past due 90 days and greater, nonaccrual status, or experienced a charge-off during the period. In cohorts where the Company s historical data is insufficient due to a minimal amount of default activity or zero defaults, management uses index PDs comprised of rates derived from the PD experience of other community banks in place of the Company s historical PDs. Additionally, management reviews all other cohorts to determine if index PDs should be used outside of these criteria. 
 
 The LGD calculation looks at actual losses (net charge-offs) experienced over the entire lookback period for each cohort of loans. The aggregate loss amount is divided by the exposure at default to determine an LGD rate. All defaults (non-accrual, charge-off, or greater than 90 days past due) occurring during the lookback period are included in the denominator, whether a loss occurred or not and exposure at default is determined by the loan balance immediately preceding the default event (i.e., nonaccrual or charge-off). Due to limited charge-off history, management uses index LGDs comprised of rates derived from the LGD experience of other community banks in place of the Company s historical LGDs. 
 
 The Company utilizes reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions when estimating the ACL on loans. The calculation includes a 12-month PD forecast based on the Company s regression model comparing peer nonperforming loan ratios to the national unemployment rate. After the forecast period, PD rates revert on a straight-line basis back to long-term historical average rates over a 12-month period. Due to limited default history, management uses index PDs comprised of rates derived from the PD experience of other community banks in place of the Company s historical PDs. 
 
 The Company recognizes that all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio must be considered to determine the estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date. Furthermore, the methodology, in and of itself and even when selectively adjusted by comparison to market and peer data, does not provide a sufficient basis to determine the estimated credit losses. The Company adjusts the modeled historical losses by qualitative and environmental adjustments to incorporate all significant risks to form a sufficient basis to estimate the credit losses. 
 
 Loans classified as nonaccrual, are reviewed quarterly for potential individual assessment. Any loan classified as a nonaccrual that is not determined to need individual assessment is evaluated collectively within its respective cohort. 
 
 Where the primary and/or expected source of repayment of a specific loan is believed to be the future liquidation of available collateral, impairment will generally be measured based upon expected future collateral proceeds, net of disposition expenses including sales commissions as well as other costs potentially necessary to sell the asset(s) (i.e., past due taxes, liens, etc.). Estimates of future collateral proceeds will be based upon available appraisals, reference to recent valuations of comparable properties, use of consultants or other professionals with relevant market and/or property-specific knowledge, and any other sources of information believed appropriate by management under the specific circumstances. When appraisals are ordered to support the impairment analysis of an impaired loan, the appraisal is reviewed by the Company s internal appraisal reviewer. 
 
 Where the primary and/or expected source of repayment of a specific loan is believed to be the receipt of principal and interest payments from the borrower and/or the refinancing of the loan by another creditor, impairment will generally be measured based upon the present value of expected proceeds discounted at the contractual interest rate. Expected refinancing proceeds may be estimated from review of term sheets received by the borrower from other creditors and/or from the Company s knowledge of terms generally available from other banks. 

52

Table of Contents 

Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications. Prepayment assumptions will be determined by analysis of historical behavior by loan cohort. 
 
 ACL on Unfunded Commitments. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL for unfunded commitments is adjusted through a provision for (recapture of) credit losses. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate utilizes the same factors and assumptions as the ACL on loans and is applied at the same collective cohort level. 
 
 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company s accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data of Form 10 K. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Assets. Total assets were relatively unchanged at 2.97 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. There were, however, shifts in a number of categories including decreases of 64.7 million in securities available-for-sale, 25.4 million in total cash and cash equivalents, and 12.2 million in certificates of deposit at other financial institutions, partially offset by increases of 62.2 million in loans receivable, net, 23.7 million in loans held for sale, and 21.2 million in other assets consisting primarily of a federal income tax receivable of 25.7 million. 
 
 Loans receivable, net increased 62.2 million to 2.46 billion at September 30, 2024, from 2.40 billion at December 31, 2023. Total real estate loans increased 20.1 million to 1.55 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting increases in one-to-four-family loans (excluding loans held for sale) of 23.9 million, multi-family loans of 14.7 million, and home equity loans of 5.6 million, partially offset by decreases in CRE loans of 13.4 million and construction and development loans of 10.7 million. Undisbursed construction and development loan commitments increased 19.3 million to 174.0 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to 154.6 million at December 31, 2023. Commercial business loans increased 56.1 million to 312.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, as a result of increases in C I loans of 58.5 million, slightly offset by a decrease in warehouse lending of 2.3 million. Consumer loans decreased 14.3 million to 632.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 17.7 million in indirect home improvement loans, partially offset by an increase of 3.5 million in marine loans. 
 
 Loans held for sale, consisting of one-to-four-family loans, increased by 23.7 million to 49.4 million at September 30, 2024, from 25.7 million at December 31, 2023. The Company continues to invest in its home lending operations and strategically manage production capacity in the markets we serve. 
 
 One-to-four-family loan originations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 426.7 million of loans originated for sale, 120.2 million of portfolio loans including first and second liens, and 13.4 million of loans brokered to other institutions.

The ACL on loans totaled 31.2 million or 1.25 of gross loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale) at
 September 30, 2024, compared to 31.5 million or 1.30 of gross loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale) at
 December 31, 2023. The ACL on unfunded loan commitments was 1.5 million at both 
 September 30, 2024 and 
 December 31, 2023.

Classified loans totaled 23.2 million at 
 September 30, 2024, all of which were classified as substandard, compared to 24.9 million at 
 December 31, 2023, of which 24.5 million were classified as substandard and 399,000 were classified as doubtful. Nonperforming loans, consisting solely of nonaccrual loans, decreased 180,000 to 10.8 million at 
 September 30, 2024, from 11.0 million at 
 December 31, 2023, primarily due to decreases in marine loans of 109,000, commercial business loans of 108,000, and indirect home improvement loans of 93,000, partially offset by increases in one-to-four-family loans of 70,000, CRE of 42,000, and construction and development loans of 38,000. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total gross loans was 0.43 at
 September 30, 2024, compared to 0.45 at 
 December 31, 2023. There were no OREO properties at both 
 September 30, 2024 and 
 December 31, 2023.

L iabilities. Total liabilities decreased 26.9 million to 2.68 billion at September 30, 2024, from 2.71 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 95.0 million in deposits, offset by an increase of 70.1 million in borrowings. 
 
 Total deposits decreased 95.0 million to 2.43 billion at September 30, 2024, from 2.52 billion at December 31, 2023, reflecting decreases in all deposit categories except CDs. Transactional accounts (noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking and escrow accounts) decreased 91.2 million to 823.7 million at September 30, 2024, from 914.9 million at December 31, 2023, due to decreases of 78.1 million in interest-bearing checking and 12.8 million in noninterest-bearing checking and decrease of 300,000 in escrow accounts related to mortgages serviced. Money market and savings accounts decreased 19.3 million to 491.4 million at September 30, 2024, from 510.7 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 CDs, which include both retail and non-retail CDs, increased 15.5 million to 1.11 billion at September 30, 2024, from December 31, 2023, as customers shifted funds from lower-yielding transaction and savings accounts to higher-yielding CDs. Retail CDs increased 127.0 million to 849.3 million at September 30, 2024, from 722.3 million at December 31, 2023, while non-retail CDs, which include brokered CDs, online CDs and public funds CDs decreased 111.6 million to 262.9 million, compared to 374.5 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in non-retail CDs was primarily due to a decrease of 111.0 million in brokered CDs, as management shifted its funding source to FHLB borrowings for more favorable rates. Non-retail CDs represented 23.6 and 34.2 of total CDs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Borrowings increased 70.1 million to 163.8 million at September 30, 2024, from 93.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increased borrowings were primarily attributable to a decline in total brokered deposits. At September 30, 2024, borrowings were comprised of FHLB term borrowings of 153.8 million and overnight borrowings of 10.0 million. 
 
 Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity increased 24.4 million to 288.9 million at September 30, 2024, from 264.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders' equity reflects net income of 27.6 million, partially offset by cash dividends totaling 6.2 million and stock repurchases totaling 4.2 million, which included 1.7 million of shares repurchased in connection with withholding taxes paid on the vesting of restricted stock awards, and the net exercise of stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Stockholders' equity was also impacted by decreases in unrealized net losses in securities available-for-sale of 9.2 million, net of tax, and by increases in unrealized net losses on fair value and cash flow hedges of 4.2 million, net of tax, reflecting sales of investment securities in unrealized loss positions and changes in market interest rates benefiting hedges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , resulting in a 5.0 million net decline in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. 
 
 Book value per common share was 37.45 at September 30, 2024, compared to 34.36 at December 31, 2023. The calculation of book value per share at September 30, 2024, was based on 7,713,359 common shares, after deducting the 103,813 unvested restricted stock shares from the 7,817,172 reported common shares outstanding as of that date. Similarly, the book value per share at December 31, 2023, was calculated based on 7,698,401 common shares, after deducting the 102,144 unvested restricted stock shares from the 7,800,545 reported common shares outstanding as of that date. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. Net income was 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to a 2.9 million, or 116.6 , decrease in provision for income tax expense due to energy tax credits purchased during the current quarter and a 985,000, or 19.8 , increase in total noninterest income, partially offset by a 2.2 million, or 9.5 , increase in noninterest expense.

Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 610,000 to 31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 30.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income of 3.8 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 3.2 million. The 3.8 million increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of 3.9 million in interest income on loans receivable, including fees, driven primarily by a 34-basis point increase in the average yield earned on loans receivable as new loans were originated at higher rates and variable-rate loans repriced higher, and a higher average balance of loans outstanding. The 3.2 million increase in total interest expense was primarily the result of higher market interest rates, higher utilization of borrowings, and a shift in deposit mix from transactional accounts to higher cost CDs. 
 
 Net interest margin NIM increased one basis point to 4.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.34 for the same period the prior year. The change in NIM reflects the increase in yields earned on interest-earning assets, along with higher average capital relative to the prior period. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 3.8 million to 47.0 million, from 43.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to a 55.5 million increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets and a 43-basis point increase in the average yield on total interest-earning assets, particularly on loans receivable, net.

Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 3.2 million to 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 12.6 million for the comparable quarter in 2023, due to an increase of interest expense on deposits of 3.0 million and on borrowings of 139,000. The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased 58 basis points to 3.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was predominantly due to higher deposit costs and an increase in the average balances of higher-cost CDs. The average cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased 71 basis points to 3.09 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.38 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023. While the average balance of total interest-bearing deposits was virtually unchanged at 1.74 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was a shift within the deposit mix: the average balance of higher-cost CDs increased 88.0 million, whereas the average balance of lower-cost transaction and savings accounts decreased 91.5 million. The average cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing checking, increased 47 basis points to 2.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 1.5 million, consisting of a 1.6 million provision for credit losses on loans, partially offset by a 79,000 reversal of the ACL on unfunded loan commitments, compared to 548,000 provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of a 684,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a 14,000 provision for credit losses on securities held-to-maturity, partially offset by a 149,000 reversal of the ACL on unfunded loan commitments. The provision for credit losses on loans reflects the increase in charge-off activity and increases in the loan portfolio. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs totaled 1.6 million, compared to 533,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was the result of increased net charge-offs of 996,000 in indirect home improvement loans and 82,000 in marine loans, partially offset by a net recovery of 8,000 in other consumer loans. A decline in national and local economic conditions, as a result the effects of inflation, a recession or slowed economic growth, among other economic factors, could result in a material increase in the ACL on loans and may adversely affect the Company s financial condition and result of operations. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased 985,000 to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects a 648,000 increase in gain on sale of loans primarily as a result of the increased volume of loans sold, and an increase of 566,000 in other noninterest income, primarily due to fair value changes on loans. Noninterest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, also reflects a 141,000 gain on the sale of MSRs, with no similar transaction occurring in the comparable quarter last year. These increases were partially offset by a 400,000 decrease in service charges and fee income, primarily due to the sale of MSRs in the first quarter of 2024. Gross margin on home loan sales decreased to 2.96 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 2.2 million to 25.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 23.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of 506,000 in impairment of MSRs due to changes in mortgage interest rates and higher estimated prepayment rates, 482,000 in salaries and benefits due to competitive wage adjustments, additional staffing to support growth, and higher overall benefit costs, 557,000 in professional and board fees, which included 571,000 in nonrecurring consulting charges and legal fees related to application/system upgrades and tax credit work, 418,000 in operations, and 315,000 in data processing. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease of 105,000 in amortization of CDI. 
 
 The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by total net interest income and noninterest income, weakened to 69.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in noninterest expense that outpaced total revenue growth.

Provision for Income Taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of 420,000, as compared to a provision for income taxes of 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The tax benefit was due to the purchase during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, of alternative energy tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction act of 2022, resulting in a gain of 2.3 million, which was partially offset by the 1.8 million provision for income taxes recorded on the net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced several energy tax credits designed to promote clean energy investments, reduce carbon emissions, and accelerate the transition to renewable energy. The effective corporate income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (4.3) , which was reduced by 2,300 basis points due to the energy tax credits discussed above, and 22.0 , respectively. The decrease in the effective corporate income tax rate, excluding the effects of the energy tax credits, was attributable to tax benefits derived from the exercises of employee stock options during the current quarter. 
 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. Net income increased 1.4 million to 27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to a 2.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes and a 1.5 million, or 1.6 , increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 1.9 million increase in noninterest expense and a 617,000 increase in provision for credit losses.

Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 857,000 to 92.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 92.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings, partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income. Total interest expense increased 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of higher market interest rates, higher utilization of borrowings and a shift in deposit mix from lower-cost transactional accounts to higher-cost CDs. Total interest income increased 15.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase of 13.1 million in interest income on loans receivable, including fees, impacted primarily as a result of a 33 basis point increase in the average yield earned on loans receivable, as new loans were originated at higher rates and variable-rate loans repriced higher, and a higher average balance of loans outstanding. In addition, interest income on investment securities, excluding FHLB stock, increased 2.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing deposits at other financial institutions of 426,000, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in interest income on investment securities, excluding FHLB stock, was primarily due to higher market interest rates generally, while the decrease in interest income on interest-bearing deposits at other financial institutions was due to a decrease in the average balance outstanding of such deposits. 
 
 Net interest margin NIM decreased 26 basis points to 4.30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.56 for the same period in the prior year. The change in NIM reflects the increased costs of deposits and borrowings which outpaced the increased yields earned on interest-earning assets, as well as an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 15.1 million to 137.9 million, from 122.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 137.1 million increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets and a 41 basis points increase in the average yield on total interest-earning assets.

Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 16.0 million to 45.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 29.9 million for the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to an increase of interest expense on deposits of 14.9 million and on borrowings of 1.0 million. The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased 94 basis points to 3.09 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to both an increase in cost for deposits and borrowings, and an increase in the average balances of CDs and borrowings. The average cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased 102 basis points to 2.96 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.94 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of total interest-bearing deposits increased 84.6 million to 1.79 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.70 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of a 215.8 million increase in the average balance of higher-cost CDs and a 131.2 million decrease in the average balance of lower-cost transaction and savings accounts. The average cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing checking, increased 75 basis points to 2.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 4.0 million, consisting of a 4.0 million provision for credit losses on loans, compared to 3.4 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of a 4.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, partially offset by a 745,000 reversal of the ACL on unfunded loan commitments. The provision for credit losses on loans reflects the increase in charge-off activity and increases in the loan portfolio. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs increased 2.7 million to 4.3 million, compared to 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase included 1.5 million in indirect home improvement loan charge-offs, along with net charge-off increases of 1.0 million in C I loans, 146,000 in marine loans, and 117,000 in other consumer loans. Management attributes the increase in net charge-offs over the year primarily to volatile economic conditions. A decline in national and local economic conditions, as a result the effects of inflation, a recession or slowed economic growth, among other economic factors, could result in a material increase in the ACL on loans and may adversely affect the Company s financial condition and result of operations. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased 1.9 million to 16.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of an 8.4 million increase in gain on sale of MSRs recorded during the first nine months of 2024 with no similar transaction occurring in the comparable nine month period in 2023,and a 1.5 million increase in gain on sale of loans, partially offset by a 7.8 million loss on sale of investment securities resulting from management's strategic decision to increase the yields earned on and reduce the duration of the securities portfolio by selling lower-yielding securities, and an 839,000 decrease in service charges and fee income due to a reduction of loan servicing fees due to the sale of MSRs in the first quarter of 2024. Gross margin on home loan sales decreased to 3.06 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 1.9 million to 73.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 71.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases of 1.1 million in data processing, 1.0 million in professional and board fees which included 824,000 in nonrecurring consulting charges and legal fees for the reasons stated above, 610,000 operations expense, and 545,000 in impairment of MSRs due to increases in estimated prepayment rates, partially offset by a decrease of 1.6 million in acquisition costs as a result of no acquisition costs during the current period. 
 
 The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by total net interest income and noninterest income, weakened to 67.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 4.1 million as compared to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the purchase of alternative energy tax credits resulting in a gain of 2.3 million. Excluding the effects of tax credits, the effective corporate income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 20.0 and 22.0 , respectively. The decrease in the effective corporate income tax rate was attributable to tax benefits derived from the exercises of employee stock options. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business. The Company relies on several different sources to meet potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts, FHLB borrowings, purchases of federal funds, sale of securities available-for-sale, cash flows from loan payments, sales of one-to-four-family loans held for sale, and maturing securities. While the maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
 
 The Bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund its operations. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s total borrowing capacity was 695.8 million with the FHLB of Des Moines, with unused borrowing capacity of 531.6 million. The FHLB borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily real estate loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB borrowings. At September 30, 2024, the Bank held approximately 1.11 billion in loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB borrowings. 
 
 In addition to the availability of liquidity from the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank maintains a short-term borrowing line with the FRB with a limit of 275.4 million and a combined credit limit of 101.0 million in written federal funds lines of credit through correspondent banking relationships at September 30, 2024. The FRB borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily consumer loans that qualify as collateral for FRB line of credit. At September 30, 2024, the Bank held approximately 617.9 million in loans that qualify as collateral for the FRB line of credit. There were no outstanding borrowings with the FRB or correspondent banks as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Subject to market conditions, we expect to utilize these borrowing facilities from time to time in the future to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy other financial commitments, repay maturing debt and to take advantage of investment opportunities to the extent feasible. 
 
 The Bank s Asset and Liability Management Policy permits management to utilize brokered deposits up to 20 of deposits or 486.9 million at September 30, 2024. Total brokered deposits at September 30, 2024 were 251.3 million. Management utilizes brokered deposits to mitigate interest rate risk and to enhance liquidity when appropriate. 
 
 Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of the Company s management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer-term basis, a strategy is maintained of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including U.S. Government obligations and U.S. agency securities. The Company uses sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits, fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At September 30, 2024, outstanding loan commitments, including unused lines of credit totaled 563.7 million. The Company purchased 47.7 million in securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company purchased 46.9 million in securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Proceeds from securities repayments, maturities and sales were 115.3 million and 13.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Bank s liquidity is also affected by the volume of loans sold and loan principal payments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank sold 426.0 million and 320.9 million in loans, respectively.

Table of Contents 

Total deposits decreased 95.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a net decrease in brokered deposits of 180.3 million. CDs scheduled to mature in three months or less at September 30, 2024, totaled 415.2 million. It is management s policy to offer deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this strategy, management believes that a majority of maturing relationship deposits will remain with the Bank. 
 
 For the remainder of 2024, we project that fixed commitments will include 479,000 of operating lease payments. For information regarding our operating leases, see Note 6 Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. FHLB borrowings of 105.0 million are scheduled to mature within the next twelve months. 
 
 As a separate legal entity from the Bank, FS Bancorp, Inc. must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its own operating expenses (many of which are paid to the Bank), FS Bancorp is responsible for paying for any stock repurchases, dividends declared to its stockholders, interest and principal on outstanding debt, and other general corporate expenses. Sources of capital and liquidity for FS Bancorp include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to make distributions. 
 
 Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory notice and certain restrictions. The unrestricted cash of FS Bancorp held at the Bank on an unconsolidated basis totaled 7.2 million at September 30, 2024. The Company currently expects to continue the current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on common stock subject to the Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is 0.27 per share, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank and returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2024 at this rate of 0.27 per share, our total dividends paid each quarter would be approximately 2.1 million based on the number of the current outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Under FS Bancorp s existing stock repurchase program, approximately 1.4 million remained available for future repurchases as of September 30, 2024. On July 11, 2024, the Company publicly announced that its Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase up to 5.0 million shares of Company common stock. The repurchases may be executed, from time to time, in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or by withholding shares upon the exercise of equity awards over a 12-month period until July 31, 2025. See Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds in Item 2, Part II of this Form 10-Q for additional information relating to stock repurchases. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 The Bank is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the FDIC. Based on its capital levels at September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded these requirements as of that date. Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain a well-capitalized status under the capital categories of the FDIC. Based on capital levels at September 30, 2024, the Bank was considered to be well capitalized. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 leverage-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital, and common equity Tier 1 capital ratios of 11.2 , 12.9 , 14.2 , and 12.9 , respectively. 
 
 As a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve, the Company is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies with less than 3.0 billion in assets are generally not subject to compliance with the Federal Reserve s capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to the Bank. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the holding company s subsidiary bank and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If FS Bancorp were subject to regulatory capital guidelines for bank holding companies with 3.0 billion or more in assets at September 30, 2024, FS Bancorp would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. For informational purposes, the regulatory capital ratios calculated for FS Bancorp at September 30, 2024 were 9.7 for Tier 1 leverage-based capital, 11.2 for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 14.4 for total risk-based capital, and 11.2 for CET 1 capital ratio. For additional information regarding regulatory capital compliance, see the discussion included in Note 13 Regulatory Capital to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in the market risk disclosures contained in FS Bancorp s 2023 Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 An evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) of the Exchange Act was carried out as of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO and several other members of the Company s senior management. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 
 Based upon the foregoing evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to FS Bancorp management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company occasionally becomes involved in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, any liability from such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes in the Risk Factors previously disclosed in FS Bancorp s 2023 Form 10-K.
