We
accounted for the Merger transaction as a recapitalization resulting from the acquisition by a non-operating public company that is not
a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). This accounting treatment as a recapitalization
is consistent with Commission guidance promulgated in staff speeches and the SEC Reporting Manual, Topic 12 on Reverse Acquisitions and
Recapitalizations. As such, the transaction is outside the scope of FASB ASC 805. Specifically, the Merger transaction was treated as
a reverse recapitalization in which the entity that issues securities (the legal acquirer) is determined to be the accounting acquiree,
while the entity receiving securities (the legal acquiree) is the accounting acquirer. 

Under
reverse merger accounting (i.e., recapitalization), historical financial statements of Shurepower,
LLC the legal acquiree, accounting acquirer), are presented with one adjustment, which is to retroactively
adjust the accounting acquirer s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That adjustment is required
to reflect the capital of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree). Comparative information presented in the financial statements also
is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree).

a result of the merger transaction the Company reduced its accumulated deficit and increased its additional paid in capital by approximately

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Note 2 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation
of the Financial Statements. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and, as such, are not required to provide the information
under this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Each
of our principal executive and principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as
of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on their evaluation, each such person concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Our
management has evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter.
Based on that evaluation, management concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during
the relevant period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
