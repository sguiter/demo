of significant segment expenses that are provided to the CODM as well as interim disclosures for all reportable segment s profit
or loss and assets. This guidance also requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses

Overview

Equity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,100,957; cash of 37,403; and a working capital deficit of 986,427, compared
to accumulated deficit of 689,303; cash of 166,552 and a working capital deficit of 647,227 as of March 31, 2024. 

The
increase in the working capital deficit was primarily driven by a rise in other receivables and current assets, an increase in
account receivable, increased advances to suppliers, a increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and an increase in other
payables, which affected available cash. 

The
Company s net loss was partially offset by non-cash expenses, including 71,921 in depreciation and 150,385 in amortization related
to right-of-use (ROU) assets, mainly associated with leased office spaces and leasehold improvements. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased fixed assets totalling 44,820 and received advances of 138,745 from related
parties for working capital. These advances are currently not due for repayment, and the shareholders are prepared to continue providing
funding as needed. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 37,403 in cash and cash equivalents and did not have any outstanding bank loans. Our liabilities
are primarily funded by shareholder loans, which do not require immediate repayment. Operations are continuing as usual, and management
is committed to implementing expense control measures in the near term to support liquidity. 

Going
Concern Assessment 

The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated
deficit and other adverse key financial ratios. 

Management s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include attempts to consummate
a business combination and to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely basis; as well
as to obtain additional working capital funds as loans from the majority shareholder and the President of the Company. 

21 

The
unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the
Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The
critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this 10-Q report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable
financial information about our operating results and financial condition

As
a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide this information under this item pursuant to Regulation S-K. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order
to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Based on our management s
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls were not, in design and operation,
effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject to the risk that
the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

22 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there were material weakness in
our internal controls over Financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 and they were therefore not as effective as they could be to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules
and forms. The material weakness in our controls and procedure were lack of US GAAP knowledge and segregation duties. Management does
not believe that any of these material weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial statements. However,
in view of this discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)
of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
