 The Company performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 initially using a qualitative ass essment. The Company considered its share price decreases as well as the decrease in its quarterly sales from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to be indicative of a risk that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Based on these and other qualitative factors, the Company determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test and valuation to identify the fair value of its reporting unit. 
 
 Based on the quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill was t impaired because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately million. The Company estimated the fair value of its reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow and public company market approach with a and weighting, respectively. A key assumption under the cash flow approach was a weighted average cost of capital. A key assumption under the public company market approach was a control premium.

 million and an income tax provision of approximately million, respectively, and for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of million and an income tax provision of million, respectively. The decrease in the income tax provision for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 is related to the cancellation of the former CEO s performance stock units resulting in additional million of increased income during the year. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately ) , compared to approximately for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately ) , compared to approximately ) for the six months ended September 30, 2023 . The projected full-year effective tax rate used for purposes of the income tax provision for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the million impact of a favorable permanent difference associated with the cancellation of the former CEO s performance restricted shares. No tax benefit was recorded for the original compensation expense due to expected limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162 (m) and therefore, there is no tax benefit to reverse upon cancellation of the stock. The impact of this favorable permanent difference is partially offset by the impacts of stock compensation recognized for book and tax purposes. 
 Under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change , the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset its post-change income and tax liabilities may be limited. Generally, an ownership change occurs when the equity ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5 of a corporation s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period (typically three years). On April 3, 2023, of the issued and outstanding stock of PetCareRx was acquired by the Company. The merger triggered an ownership change of PetCareRx within the meaning of Section 382. 
 
 As a result of the acquisition, the Company performed a Section 382 analysis to determine if the net operating losses carried forward would have a utilization limitation. Any limitation could result in the expiration of a portion of the federal net operating loss carryforward before utilization, which would reduce the Company's gross deferred tax assets. As of April 3, 2023, and prior to the acquisition, PetCareRx had approximately million of net operating losses and million of disallowed interest expense. The results of the Section 382 analysis determined the net operating losses and disallowed interest expense in total, would be limited and reduced to approximately million.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations contained herein are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements and the data used to prepare them. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an ongoing basis we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies. 
 There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on June 11, 2024, except as noted below: 
 
 17 

Long-lived Assets 
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. Management determined that no impairment of long-lived assets existed as of September 30, 2024. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company is required to assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company has concluded that it has one reporting unit and has assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 The Company performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 initially using a qualitative ass essment. The Company considered its share price decreases as well as the decrease in its quarterly sales from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to be indicative of a risk that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Based on these and other qualitative factors, the Company determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test and valuation to identify the fair value of its reporting unit. 
 
 Based on the quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 44.8 million. The Company estimated the fair value of its reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow and public company market approach with a 70 and 30 weighting, respectively. A key assumption under the cash flow approach was a 30 weighted average cost of capital. A key assumption under the public company market approach was a 10 control premium. 
 
 The Company s other indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily made up of a trade name which was evaluated for impairment using a qualitative assessment and concluded it was not more likely than not that the other indefinite-lived assets were impaired as of September 30, 2024. 
 Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risk 
 
 Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, rising fuel, utility, and food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also expect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our revenue growth rates. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations for the remainder of fiscal 2025.

Results of Operations 
 The following should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following table sets forth, as a percentage of sales, certain operating data appearing in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales 70.9 71.7 72.3 71.5 Gross profit 29.1 28.3 27.7 28.5 Operating expenses: General and administrative 17.6 16.8 12.1 18.5 Advertising 7.7 7.8 9.1 8.6 Depreciation and amortization 2.8 2.4 2.6 2.3 Total operating expenses 28.1 27.0 23.8 29.4 Income (loss) from operations 1.0 1.3 3.9 (0.9) Total other income 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.7 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 To provide investors and the market with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed (see below) adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income excluding share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax provision, interest income (expense), and other non-operational expenses. We have provided reconciliations below of net income to adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 We have included adjusted EBITDA herein because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and other expenses. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. 
 We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as net stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization from our adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude income tax provision and interest income (expense ), a s neither are components of our core business operations. We also believe that it is useful 
 19 

to exclude other non-operational expenses, including acquisition costs related to PetCareRx, employee severance and estimated state sales tax accruals and settlements as these items are not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect net share-based compensation. Share-based compensation has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a material recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), net; or changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect transaction related costs and other items which are either not representative of our underlying operations or are incremental costs that result from an actual or planned transaction and include litigation matters, integration consulting fees, internal salaries and wages (to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs related to integrating and converging IT systems; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non-operating expenses including the employee severance which reduces cash available to us; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non operating expenses (income) including sales tax expense (income) relating to recording a liability for sales tax we did not collect from our customers. 
 Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces the measure s usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Because of these and other limitations, adjusted EBITDA should only be considered as supplemental to, and alongside with other GAAP based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income, net margin, and our other GAAP results.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared With Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Sales 
 Sales decreased by approximately 11.4 million, or 16.1 , to approximately 59.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to approx imately 71.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . Sales decreased by approximately 21.7 million, or 14.6 , to approximately 127.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approx imately 149.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 reflects broader macroeconomic factors partially offset by lower consumer promotional usage. The decrease in sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 reflects both broader macroeconomic factors and higher consumer promotional usage. 
 Reorder sales decreased by approximately 8.0 million, or 13.7 , to approximately 50.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 58.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . Reorder sales decreased by approximately 15.9 million, or 13.2 , to approximately 104.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 120.2 million for the for six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in reorder sales is primarily due to a decline in prescription medication sales. 
 New order sales decreased by approximately 3.1 million or 29.4 , to approximately 7.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. New order sales decreased by approximatel y 5.4 million or 22.3 , to approximately 18.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in new order sales is primarily due to a strategic reduction in media spend. 
 We acquired approximately 77,000 new customers for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 113,000 new customers for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We acquired approximately 197,000 new 
 22 

customers for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 250,000 new customers for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The following tables illustrates sales by various sales classifications: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 
 Revenue (In thousands) 2024 2023 
 
 Reorder sales 50,052 84.0 58,017 81.7 (7,965) (13.7) New order sales 7,449 12.5 10,558 14.9 (3,109) (29.4) Membership fees 2,069 3.5 2,424 3.4 (355) (14.6) Total net sales 59,570 100.0 70,999 100.0 (11,429) (16.1)

 The Company changed the definition of a new order sale on July 1, 2024, to include sales from customers who have not previously ordered from the Company over the past twelve months compared to the prior definition which was thirty-six months. The reorder and new order sales amounts for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and the reorder and new order sales amounts for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 reflect this new definition. 
 Under the previous definition of a new customer, reorder and new order sales were 62.4 million and 6.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Under the previous definition of a new customer, reorder and new order sales were 130.4 million and 14.0 million, respectively, for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 AutoShip Save subscription sales as a percentage of total sales was 53.3 of net sales for the most recent quarter ended September 30, 2024, up from 51.0 of net sales for the same period last year. 
 Going forward, sales may be adversely affected due to increased competition and consumers giving more consideration to price. The changes in consumer behavior due to macroeconomic factors makes future sales somewhat challenging to predict. No guarantees can be made that sales will grow in the future. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales decreased by approximately 8.7 million, or 17.0 , to approximately 42.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 50.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales decreased by approximately 14.4 million, or 13.5 , to approximately 92.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 106.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, was 70.9 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 71.7 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, was 72.3 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 71.5 for the six months ended September 30, 2023 . The cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in vendor promotional activity in the most recent period. The cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, increased for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in discount activity in the most recent period. 
 23 

Gross profit 
 Gross profit decreased by approximately 2.8 million, or 13.7 , to approximately 17.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 20.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit decreased by approximately 7.3 million, or 17.2 , to approximately 35.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 42.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 .The gross profit decreases for the quarter and six months ended ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended and six months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to lower sales. The gross margin percentage increased by approximately 0.8 , to approximately 29.1 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 28.3 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to favorable sales mix and lower discount activity in the most recent quarter. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 1.5 million, or 12.3 , to approximately 10.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , from approximately 12.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease to general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 1.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to reduced stock compensation associated with an executive departure, a 0.3 million decrease in payroll, and a 0.4 million decrease in credit card processing fees. These decreases were partially offset a 0.3 million increase in professional fees. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 12.3 million, or 44.5 , to approximately 15.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 27.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease to general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an 11.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, of which 8.7 million was from the stock compensation reversal associated with an executive departure, a 0.5 million decrease in credit card processing fees which were driven by lower sales, and a 0.6 million decrease in payroll. 
 Advertising expenses 
 Advertising expenses decreased by approximately 0.9 million, or 16.4 , to approximately 4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 5.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease for the quarter can be mainly attributed to lower gross media spend and by lower marketing funded by manufacturers. The advertising costs of acquiring a new customer, defined as total advertising costs divi ded by new customers acquired, was 60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 49 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The increase to customer acquisition costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was due to a less efficient variable marketing spend. The advertising cost of acquiring a new customer can be impacted by the advertising environment, the effectiveness of our advertising creative, spending, and price competition. Historically, the advertising environment fluctuates due to supply and demand. A more favorable advertising environment may positively impact future sales, whereas a less favorable advertising environment may negatively impact future sales. As a percentag e of sales, advertising expense was 7.7 and 7.8 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The advertising percentage may fluctuate quarter to quarter due to seasonality and advertising availability. 
 Advertising expenses decreased by approximately 1.2 million, or 9.2 , to approximately 11.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 12.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease can be mainly attributed to lower gross media spend partially offset by lower marketing funded by manufacturers. The advertisi ng costs of acquiring a new customer, defined as total advertising costs divided by new customers acquired, was 59 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 51 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentag e of sales, advertising expense was 9.1 and 8.6 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 1.7 million and 1.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was 3.4 million and 3.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Other income 
 Other income remained unchanged for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other income decreased to approximately 0.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1.1 million for the 
 24 

six months ended September 30, 2023 .The decrease to other income for the quarter was due to slightly lower invested balances, and a one time payment received in prior year. Interest income may decrease in the future based on several factors, including utilization of our cash balances on future investments or partnerships, or on our operating activities. Additionally, interest income could increase or decrease if the current interest rate environment changes. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately 1.4 million and a tax provision of approximately 0.6 million, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately 0.4 million and a tax provision of approximately 0.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the tax provision for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 is related to the cancellation of the former CEO s performance stock units resulting in additional 8.7 million of income during the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was approximately (151.5) , compared to approximately 44.1 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. We continue to monitor, evaluate, and manage our operating plans, forecasts, and liquidity considering the most recent developments driven by macroeconomic conditions, such as supply chain challenges, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical events. We proactively seek opportunities to improve the efficiency of our operations, take steps to realize internal cost savings, including aligning our staffing needs, creating a more variable cost structure to better support our current and expected future levels of operations and process streamlining. 
 Current Sources of Liquidity 
 Our working capital at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was 21.9 million and 21.5 million, respectively. The 0.5 million increase in working capital was attributable to the 22.9 million decrease in current assets, primarily inventory and prepaid expenses, which were offset by the 23.3 million decrease in current liabilities, primarily accounts payable. Net cash used in operating activities was 1.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in operating activities of 0.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 . The inventory decline was attributable to the Company s SKU rationalization strategy to reduce the amount of inventory on hand. T he 0.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due to the 6.5 million increase in net income reduced by 11.5 million of non-cash operating adjustments and offset by the 4.1 million increase in current liabilities net of current assets excluding cash. Net cash used in investing activities was 1.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 38.0 million used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the PetCareRx acquisition and an additional investment in Vetster in the prior year. Net cash used in financing activities was 0.2 million and 12.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and the six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to the payment of an aggregate 0.60 per share dividend for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The board reviews and discusses the capital allocation needs of the Company on a quarterly basis and as part of that review on October 26, 2023, our Board of Directors elected to suspend the quarterly dividend indefinitely. This move was intended to focus use of the Company s existing cash flow on growth initiatives and other, higher return initiatives. The declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the Board of Directors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.2 million in outstanding lease commitments assumed in the PetCareRx acquisition for the leases on two buildings. Other than the foregoing leases, we are not currently bound by any material long-term or short-term commitments for the purchase or lease of capital expenditures. Any material amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately provide for any future increase in our business. To date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working capital funds and anticipate this being the case in the future. Our primary source of working capital is cash from operations. We presently have no alternative sources of working capital and have no commitments.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The book values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Interest rates affect our return on excess cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2024, we had 52.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and the majority of our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates. A significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and cash equivalents. It would also impact the market value of our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. Our cash and cash equivalents are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by our Board of Directors. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality, and maturity, and are intended to limit market risk by maintaining cash in federally-insured bank deposit accounts and restricting cash equivalents to highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. We do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk. At September 30, 2024, we had no debt obligations. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to material weaknesses described below. 
 Material Weaknesses 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 As identified in our 2024 Form 10-K, we identified the following material weaknesses: 
 1. A material weakness in the design of our controls over the review of appropriate application of GAAP relating to our sales tax liability as well as an additional tax error relating the misapplication of Internal Revenue Code Section162(m) which limits the deductibility of executive compensation in our consolidated financial statements. We also identified a material weakness in the design of our controls over accurate valuation of our deferred tax asset and goodwill relating to our acquisition of PetCareRx . 
 2. A material weakness in internal controls relating to our information technology general controls ITGCs in the areas of user access, change management, and service organizations over information technology IT systems that support the Company s financial reporting processes. This material weakness may impact revenue and other business process controls and automated controls reliant upon these ITGCs. We believe these control deficiencies have been influenced by insufficient documentation to support management's procedures. The individual deficiencies identified to preventative and detective controls resulted in an aggregate material weakness related to ITGCs. This material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements or any change in previously released financial results. 
 Management is taking steps to remediate these material weaknesses (see Remediation of Material Weaknesses for details). 
 
 Remediation of Material Weaknesses 
 
 In response to the material weakness due to the tax calculations, we have developed and are in the process of implementing a remediation plan. The key elements of the plan include: 
 26 

1. Enhancing the oversight and review of tax-related accounting estimates and calculations to ensure they are complete and accurate. 
 2. Providing additional training to personnel involved in tax accounting and financial reporting to enhance their understanding of the relevant accounting standards and requirements. 
 3. Enhancing the documentation of tax positions and related accounting judgments to ensure they are adequately supported and can withstand external scrutiny. 
 
 While our remediation plan related to the material weakness in internal controls relating to our information technology general controls ITGCs may evolve and expand, management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) developing and maintaining documentation underlying ITGCs; (ii) implementing an IT management review, bringing in new management and revising the testing plan to monitor ITGCs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes; and (iii) enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 The material weaknesses will be addressed once our remediation plan is fully developed and implemented. We will need to allow the updated controls to operate for an adequate period of time, after which we will conduct thorough testing to ensure the new and improved controls are operating effectively. We are actively working on implementing our remediation plan. Once this is in place, we will continue to test and monitor the new and improved controls to ensure they are operating as intended. It's possible that we may find additional steps, including adding more resources, are needed to fully address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. This could require more time for evaluation and implementation. Additionally, we might make adjustments to the remediation efforts as we proceed. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design and disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgement in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to the their cost.

If one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the Final Nomination Date but before the date of the annual meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection with the occurrence of the vacancy or vacancies, then the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. 
 (ii) Any Nominating Holder submitting more than one Nominee pursuant to this Section 3.18 for an annual meeting shall rank such Nominees based on the order in which the Nominating Holder desires such Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement for such annual meeting if the number of Nominees pursuant to this Section 3.18 exceeds the Maximum Number.

 (ii) An Eligible Holder or group of up to 20 Eligible Holders may submit a nomination in accordance with this Section 3.18 only if the person or 
 26 
 4872-2926-5138.9 

group (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined below) of shares of the Corporation s common stock throughout the three-year period preceding and including the date of submission of the Nomination Notice and continues to own at least the Minimum Number through the date of the annual meeting. A group of funds under common management and investment control shall be treated as one Eligible Holder for purposes of such limitation if such Eligible Holder shall provide together with the Nomination Notice documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that demonstrates that the funds are under common management and investment control. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a nomination by a group of Eligible Holders, any and all requirements and obligations applicable to an individual Eligible Holder that are set forth in this Section 3.18 , including the minimum holding period, shall apply to each member of such group provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the ownership of the group in the aggregate, and a breach of any obligation, agreement, representation or warranty under this Section 3.18 by any member of a group shall be deemed a breach by the Nominating Shareholder. If any shareholder withdraws from a group of Eligible Holders at any time prior to the annual meeting, then the group of Eligible Shareholders shall only be deemed to own the shares held by the remaining members of the group and if, as a result of such withdrawal, the Nominating Shareholder no longer owns the Minimum Number of shares of the Corporation s common stock, then the nomination shall be disregarded as provided in Section 3.18(b)(iii) .

 (A) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to such shares and

 provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not include any shares (1) sold by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2) borrowed by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or (3) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other 
 27 
 4872-2926-5138.9 

Derivative Instrument or similar instrument or agreement entered into by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such Eligible Holder s or any of its affiliates full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares and or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates. An Eligible Holder owns shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Holder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. An Eligible Holder s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the Eligible Holder. An Eligible Holder s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has loaned such shares provided that the Eligible Holder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days notice, recalls such loaned shares upon being notified by the Corporation that any of the Eligible Holder s Nominees will be included in the Corporation s proxy statement and proxy card for the annual meeting (subject to the provisions of this Section 3.18 and holds such shares through the date of the annual meeting.

Whether outstanding shares of the Corporation are owned for these purposes shall be determined by the Board of Directors. 
 (v) No person shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting a Nominating Shareholder, and if any person appears as a member of more than one group, then such person shall be deemed to be a member of the group that has the largest amount of shares of common stock of the Corporation disclosed as owned in the Nomination Notice. 
 (d) Nomination Notice . To nominate a Nominee for purposes of this Section 3.18 , the Nominating Shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary.

 (b) The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three (3) nor more than eleven (11) individuals, which numbers may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to these Bylaws by a majority of the directors or by an affirmative shareholder vote. Subject to the foregoing, the number of directors shall be established from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. If the terms of the directors are staggered under Section 4.6 of these Bylaws, any increase or decrease in the number of directors shall be allocated proportionately among the classes. Any decrease in the number of directors shall not prematurely shorten the term of any incumbent director. 
 (c) Qualifications . Directors must be natural persons who are eighteen years of age or older but need not be residents of the State of Florida. 
 Section 4.2 Term of Office . The term of each director shall expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders following his or her election or until his or her successor is elected and qualifies, unless their terms are staggered under Section 4.6. 
 Section 4.3 Removal . The shareholders may remove one or more directors with or without cause. A director may be removed by the shareholders at a meeting of shareholders, provided that the notice of the meeting states that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is such removal. If a director is elected by a voting group, only the shareholders of that voting group may participate in the vote to remove the director. 
 Section 4.4 Failed Director Election . Any director who fails to receive the requisite number of votes for reelection shall be required to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the offer of resignation, or whether other action should be taken. In reaching its decision, the Board of Directors will consider the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee s recommendation and may consider any other factors it deems relevant, which may include the director s qualifications, the director s past and expected future contributions to the Corporation, the overall composition of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors, whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the Corporation to fail to meet any 
 35 
 4872-2926-5138.9 

applicable rule or regulation (including the NASDAQ listing standards and the requirements of the federal securities laws) and the percentage of outstanding shares represented by the votes cast at the meeting. The director who tenders his or her offer of resignation shall not participate in the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee s recommendation or the Board of Director s decision. The Board of Directors will act on the resignation within ninety (90) days following certification of the shareholder vote for the meeting and will promptly disclose its decision and rationale as to whether to accept the resignation (or the reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) in a filing with the SEC or by other public announcement. 
 Section 4.5 Resignation . A director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Board of Directors or its Chairman or Vice Chairman (if any), or to the Corporation. A director s resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date. 
 Section 4.6 Staggered Terms for Directors . The Board of Directors may, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by amendment to these Bylaws adopted by a vote of the shareholders, be divided into one, two or three classes with the number of directors in each class being as nearly equal as possible the term of office of those of the first class to expire at the annual meeting next ensuing of the second class one year thereafter at the third class two years thereafter and at each annual election held after such classification and election, directors shall be chosen for a full term, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire. If the directors have staggered terms, then any increase or decrease in the number of directors shall be so apportioned among the classes as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible. 
 Section 4.7 Vacancies. 
 (a) Who May Fill Vacancies . Except as provided below, whenever any vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, it may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by the shareholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation. If the directors first fill a vacancy, the shareholders shall have no further right with respect to that vacancy, and if the shareholders first fill the vacancy, the directors shall have no further rights with respect to that vacancy. 
 (b) Directors Elected by Voting Groups . Whenever the holders of shares of any voting group are entitled to elect a class of one or more directors by the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, vacancies in such class may be filled by holders of shares of that voting group or by a majority of the directors then in office elected by such voting group or by a sole remaining director so elected. If no director elected by such voting group remains in office, unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, directors not elected by such voting group may fill vacancies. 
 (c) Prospective Vacancies . A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, because of a resignation effective at a later date or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

 Section 4.12 Waiver of Notice . Notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to any director who signs a waiver of notice either before or after the meeting. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting and waiver of any and all objections to the place of the meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner in which it has been called or convened, except when a director states, at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon arrival at the meeting, any objection to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. 
 Section 4.13 Quorum and Voting . A quorum of the Board of Directors consists of a majority of the number of directors prescribed by these Bylaws. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the act of the Board of Directors.
