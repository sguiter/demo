Both the asset and liability related to investment securities are recorded at fair value and are included within "Other assets" and "Other liabilities" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, respectively. In addition to the investment securities, we also had company-owned life insurance related to the deferred compensation arrangement recorded at cash surrender value in "Other assets" of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
 There were nonrecurring fair value measurements on the condensed consolidated balance sheets during the periods ended September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 Strategic Investments 
 Equity Method Investments 
 The aggregate carrying value of all strategic equity method investments totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were adjustments to the carrying value of equity method investments for impairment for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately million of unfunded commitments, associated with a venture capital fund investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which we anticipate will be paid over a period of years from the date of the investment. 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we sold a strategic equity method investment for million, resulting in a million gain, recorded within "Other (income) expense, net" on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. We recognized an additional million gain associated with the equity method investment sale during the second quarter of 2024.

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the first and third quarters of 2024, the company identified triggering events indicating that investments being accounted for under the measurement alternative may be impaired. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company recognized an impairment of million and million, respectively, recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Restricted Investment 
 Our restricted investment is a trust managed in order to secure repayment of the finance lease obligation associated with our Performance Materials' Wickliffe, Kentucky manufacturing site at maturity. The trust, presented as Restricted investment on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, originally purchased long-term bonds that mature through 2026. The principal received at maturity of the bonds, along with interest income that is reinvested in the trust, is expected to be equal to or more than the million finance lease obligation that is due in 2027. Because the provisions of the trust provide us the ability, and it is our intent, to hold the investments to maturity, the investments held by the trust are accounted for as held to maturity ("HTM"); therefore, they are held at their amortized cost. The investments held by the trust earn interest at the stated coupon rate of the invested bonds. Interest earned on the investments held by the trust is recognized and presented as interest income on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. As interest from the bonds is received and as bonds mature, any proceeds not reinvested are held in highly liquid securities and treated as restricted cash. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our restricted investment was million and million, net of an allowance for credit losses of million and million, and included restricted cash of million and million, respectively. The fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively, based on Level 1 inputs. 
 December 31, 2023 
 Debt and Finance Lease Obligations 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of finance lease obligations was million and million, respectively, and the fair value was million and million, respectively. The fair value of our finance lease obligation associated with our Performance Materials' Wickliffe, Kentucky manufacturing site, is based on the period-end quoted market prices for the obligation, using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of all other finance lease obligations approximates their carrying values. 
 The carrying value, excluding debt issuance fees, of our variable interest rate debt was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The carrying value of our variable rate debt is a reasonable estimate of the fair value.

 Annual Goodwill Test 
 We conduct a required annual review of goodwill for potential impairment at October 1st, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Our reporting units are our operating segments, i.e., Performance Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Advanced Polymer Technologies ("APT"). If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using both the income approach and market approach, goodwill is considered impaired. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, as further described below under the section titled: Goodwill Impairment Charge, we recorded a full impairment of our Performance Chemicals reporting unit goodwill. The remaining balance of our goodwill, as disclosed in the table above, is primarily related to our APT reporting unit. There have been no events or changes in circumstances during the third quarter that have required interim testing of our goodwill for impairment.

and percent. Since the fair value of our APT reporting unit is higher than the carrying value, we have concluded that no impairment to goodwill is necessary. Our analysis includes significant assumptions such as revenue growth rate, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") margin, and discount rate, which are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value. 
 Goodwill Impairment Charge 
 Beginning in fiscal year 2023, we began to see depressed volumes in our industrial end markets, constraining our ability to offset the continued crude tall oil CTO price inflation we were experiencing, and negatively impacting earnings and cash flow within our Performance Chemicals reporting unit, particularly in our industrial specialties product line. As a result, we concluded that a triggering event occurred in the third quarter of 2023. Our third quarter 2023 impairment analysis included significant assumptions, such as the execution of several measures in 2023 to pursue greater cost efficiency, including a reorganization to streamline certain functions and reduce ongoing costs, and expectations of decreased CTO costs beginning in the second half of 2024. We concluded that impairment was necessary as a result of that third quarter 2023 interim analysis or at our annual impairment test, dated October 1, 2023. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, our supplier provided new information regarding the cost of CTO for the second half of 2024, which significantly exceeded our forecasted costs, resulting in a triggering event for our Performance Chemicals reporting unit. We performed an analysis of the reporting unit s goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets. Our analysis included significant assumptions such as: revenue growth rate, EBITDA margin, and discount rate, which are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value. 
 Our analysis reassessed the expected cash flows in light of current performance and expected lack of near term recovery in our industrial specialties product line, resulting in lower volume and profitability expectations. As a result, the company concluded that the carrying amount of the Performance Chemicals reporting unit exceeded its fair value, resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of million, which represents all of the goodwill within the Performance Chemicals' reportable segment. The charge was recorded within Goodwill impairment charge on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Commodity Price Risk Management 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had million and million mm BTUS (millions of British Thermal Units) in aggregate notional volume of outstanding natural gas commodity swap contracts and zero cost collar option contracts, respectively, designated as cash flow hedges. As of September 30, 2024, open commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions until December 2025. The fair value of the outstanding designated natural gas commodity hedge contracts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was a net asset (liability) of ) million and ) million, respectively. 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to manage the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments associated with our existing Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") based interest payments, effectively converting million of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate. In accordance with the terms of this instrument, we receive floating rate interest payments based upon one-month U.S. dollar SOFR and in return are obligated to pay interest at a fixed rate of percent until August 2026. The fair value of the interest rate swap was an asset (liability) of ) million and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Our indenture contains certain customary covenants (including covenants limiting Ingevity's and its restricted subsidiaries ability to grant or permit liens on certain property securing debt, declare or pay dividends, make distributions on or repurchase or redeem capital stock, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries, engage in sale and lease-back transactions, and engage in a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of Ingevity and our restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole) and events of default (subject in certain cases to customary exceptions, as well as grace and cure periods). The occurrence of an event of default under the 2028 Senior Notes could result in the acceleration of the notes of such series and could cause a cross-default resulting in the acceleration of other indebtedness of Ingevity and its subsidiaries. We were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture as of September 30, 2024. 
 The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-compliance with covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an uncured event of default under the credit agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and our revolving credit facility being terminated. The credit agreement also contains certain customary covenants, including financial covenants. The revolving credit facility financial covenants require Ingevity to maintain on a consolidated basis a maximum total net leverage ratio of to 1.0 (which may be increased to to 1.0 under certain circumstances) and a minimum interest coverage ratio of to 1.0. As calculated per the credit agreement, our net leverage for the four consecutive quarters ended September 30, 2024 was , and our actual interest coverage for the four consecutive quarters ended September 30, 2024 was .

Also included, to the extent incurred, the acceleration effect of re-estimating settlement dates and revised cost estimates associated with asset retirement obligations related to asset disposal charges that are included within restructuring charges. 
 
 Performance Chemicals' Repositioning 
 On November 1, 2023, we announced a number of strategic actions designed to reposition our Performance Chemicals reportable segment to improve profitability and reduce the cyclicality of the company as a whole. These actions increased our focus on growing our most profitable Performance Chemicals' product lines, such as road technologies, and accelerate our transition to non-CTO based fatty acids. This initiative focused on reducing exposure to lower margin end-use markets of our industrial specialties product line, such as adhesives, publication inks, and oilfield, representing approximately percent of our industrial specialties product line historical annualized net sales. This initiative included the permanent closure of our Performance Chemicals' CTO refinery and the closure of our manufacturing plant located in DeRidder, Louisiana (the DeRidder Plant ), including the polyol production assets associated with the APT reportable segment. All production at the DeRidder Plant ceased in the first quarter of 2024. The Performance Chemicals repositioning initiative included additional corporate and business cost reduction actions executed in November 2023. 
 Additionally, in July 2024, we announced plans to transition the refining of oleo-based products manufactured for our Performance Chemicals reportable segment from our Crossett, Arkansas manufacturing plant (the Crossett Facility to our North Charleston, South Carolina manufacturing plant. This action included the closure of the Crossett Facility, as well as additional corporate and business cost reduction actions. We ceased production at the Crossett Facility in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The actions referenced above, when combined with other targeted workforce reduction initiatives during 2023 and 2024, resulted in the reduction of Ingevity's global workforce by percent. Specific to Performance Chemicals, the reduction represented approximately percent of the reportable segment's workforce. 
 Expected Charges 
 We expect to incur aggregate charges of approximately million associated with the Performance Chemicals' repositioning. This is an increase of approximately million from prior expectations due to the closure of the Crossett Facility. Total expected charges now consist of approximately million in asset-related charges, approximately million in severance and other employee-related costs, and approximately million in other restructuring costs, including decommissioning, dismantling and removal charges, and CTO supply contract termination costs. Through September 30, 2024,

million associated with these actions, including million of non-cash asset-related charges and million of charges to be settled in cash. As of September 30, 2024, million of the charges to be settled in cash have been paid and all non-cash charges have been incurred. In total, we expect approximately million of cash charges, including approximately - million during the fourth quarter of 2024 and approximately - million during 2025. 
 Inventory Charges 
 The company believes the collective actions of workforce, operational, and regional business exits will hinder our ability to dispose of the associated inventory on hand. As a result, we recorded million and million of non-cash, lower of cost or market, inventory charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to adjust the carrying value of the impacted inventory to what we expect to realize upon disposal, less disposal costs. These inventory charges are recorded to Cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 CTO Resale Activity 
 The DeRidder Plant closure, and the corresponding reduction in CTO refining capacity, significantly reduced our CTO volume requirements. However, we were obligated under an existing CTO supply contract to purchase CTO volumes through 2025 at amounts in excess of the CTO volumes needed to support our business operations. To manage this excess inventory, we sold CTO volumes (herein referred to as "CTO resales") in the open market. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have incurred million and million, respectively, of CTO resale losses, which are recorded as Other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 As of July 1, 2024, we terminated the CTO supply contract that resulted in these excess CTO volumes. As consideration for the termination of the CTO supply contract, we made a cash payment in the amount of million on July 1, 2024, and an additional cash payment in the amount of million in early October, 2024. The total charge of million was recorded within Other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the termination of this supply contract, the purchases under the CTO supply contract ended effective June 30, 2024. Therefore, we are no longer required to purchase this excess CTO volume through 2025, and as such, we expect to end our CTO resale activity by the end of 2024 and to incur no more than million in additional costs as we liquidate the excess CTO volumes on hand as of September 30, 2024. 
 The charges we currently expect to incur in connection with these actions are subject to a number of assumptions and risks, and actual results may differ materially. We may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or in connection with, these actions. 
 Other (income) charges, net 
 Alternative feedstock transition 
 In April 2023, we implemented the feedstock transition of the Crossett Facility. This transition converted the Crossett Facility from a CTO-based feedstock production facility to produce fatty acids from alternative plant-based feedstocks. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred charges of . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred charges of million and million, respectively. 
 North Charleston plant transition 
 Our North Charleston, South Carolina Performance Chemicals manufacturing plant has historically been co-located with a WestRock Company WestRock paper mill. In May 2023, WestRock announced that it would permanently cease operating its North Charleston paper mill by August 31, 2023 and notified us that it was terminating the shared services in accordance with our operating agreement. WestRock ceased production at their North Charleston paper mill in June 2023. During 2023, we executed a transition plan to separate certain critical operating services WestRock had historically provided to us such as steam, water and wastewater treatment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred charges of million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred charges of million and million, respectively.

The EAETR tax percentage shown may not precisely recalculate due to rounding. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had deferred tax assets of million and million, respectively, resulting from certain historical net operating losses from our Brazil and China operations and U.S. state tax credits for which a valuation allowance has been established. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these net operating losses and tax credits are available to be used. In evaluating the realizability of these deferred tax assets, we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making our assessment. As of September 30, 2024, we cannot objectively assert that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized and therefore we have maintained a valuation allowance. We intend to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion

 claims for violations of U.S. antitrust law (one for exclusive dealing and the other for tying) as well as a claim for tortious interference with an alleged prospective business relationship between BASF and a BASF customer (the BASF Counterclaims ). The BASF Counterclaims relate to our enforcement of the 844 Patent and our entry into several supply agreements with customers of our fuel vapor canister honeycombs. The U.S. District Court dismissed our patent infringement claims on November 18, 2020, and the case proceeded to trial on the BASF Counterclaims in September 2021. 
 On September 15, 2021, a jury in the Delaware Proceeding issued a verdict in favor of BASF on the BASF Counterclaims and awarded BASF damages of approximately million, which trebled under U.S. antitrust law to approximately million. On May 18, 2023, the court in the Delaware Proceeding entered judgment on the jury s verdict, which commenced the post-trial briefing stage. On February 13, 2024, the court in the Delaware Proceeding denied BASF s motion for pre-judgment interest on its tortious interference claim as well as our motion seeking judgment as a matter of law, or a new trial in the alternative. In addition, BASF has indicated it will seek attorneys fees and costs in amounts that they will allege and have to demonstrate at a future date. Unless the judgment is set aside, BASF will be entitled to post-judgment interest pursuant to the rate provided under federal law. 
 We disagree with the verdict, including the court s application of the law and entry of judgment. Therefore, on March 13, 2024, we appealed the verdict as well as the U.S. District Court s November 2020 dismissal of our patent infringement claims against BASF. Ingevity believes in the strength of its intellectual property and the merits of its position and intends to pursue all legal relief available to challenge these outcomes in the Delaware Proceeding. Final resolution of these matters could take up to months.

The amount of any liability we may ultimately incur could be more or less than the amount accrued.

 Overview 
 Ingevity Corporation provides products and technologies that purify, protect, and enhance the world around us. Through a diverse team of talented and experienced people, we develop, manufacture, and bring to market solutions that are largely renewably sourced and help customers solve complex problems while making the world more sustainable. Our products are used in a variety of demanding applications, including adhesives, agrochemicals, asphalt paving, bioplastics, coatings, elastomers, lubricants, pavement markings, oil production, and automotive components. We operate in three reportable segments: Performance Materials, Performance Chemicals and Advanced Polymer Technologies. 
 Recent Developments and Updates 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of 200.0 million to manage the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments associated with our existing Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") based interest payments, effectively converting 200.0 million of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate. In accordance with the terms of this instrument, we receive floating rate interest payments based upon one-month U.S. dollar SOFR and in return are obligated to pay interest at a fixed rate of 3.84 percent until August 2026. The fair value of the interest rate swap was an asset (liability) of (1.7) million and zero at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Measurement Alternative Investments 
 During the first and third quarters of 2024, the company identified triggering events indicating that investments being accounted for under the measurement alternative may be impaired. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company recognized an impairment of 6.7 million and 11.5 million, respectively, recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 30 

Annual Goodwill Test 
 We conduct a required annual review of goodwill for potential impairment at October 1st, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Our reporting units are our operating segments, i.e., Performance Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Advanced Polymer Technologies ("APT"). If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using both the income approach and market approach, goodwill is considered impaired. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a full impairment of our Performance Chemicals reporting unit goodwill. The remaining balance of our goodwill, is primarily related to our APT reporting unit. There have been no events or changes in circumstances during the third quarter that have required interim testing of our goodwill for impairment. 
 We are currently testing our remaining goodwill balance as part of our required annual October 1st goodwill impairment testing. The preliminary results have calculated that our APT reporting unit headroom, defined as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value, is between 10 and 15 percent. Since the fair value of our APT reporting unit is higher than the carrying value, we have concluded that no impairment to goodwill is necessary. Our analysis includes significant assumptions such as revenue growth rate, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") margin, and discount rate, which are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value. 
 The below table shows how changes in certain significant assumptions utilized in our preliminary annual goodwill testing, specific to our APT reporting unit, impacts the calculated headroom.

 On November 1, 2023, we announced a number of strategic actions designed to reposition our Performance Chemicals reportable segment to improve profitability and reduce the cyclicality of the company as a whole. These actions increased our focus on growing our most profitable Performance Chemicals' product lines, such as road technologies, and accelerate our transition to non-CTO based fatty acids. This initiative focused on reducing exposure to lower margin end-use markets of our industrial specialties product line, such as adhesives, publication inks, and oilfield, representing approximately 45 percent of our industrial specialties product line historical annualized net sales. This initiative included the permanent closure of our Performance Chemicals' CTO refinery and the closure of our manufacturing plant located in DeRidder, Louisiana (the DeRidder Plant ), including the polyol production assets associated with the APT reportable segment. All production at the DeRidder Plant ceased in the first quarter of 2024. The Performance Chemicals repositioning initiative included additional corporate and business cost reduction actions executed in November 2023. 
 Additionally, in July 2024, we announced plans to transition the refining of oleo-based products manufactured for our Performance Chemicals reportable segment from our Crossett, Arkansas manufacturing plant (the Crossett Facility to our North Charleston, South Carolina manufacturing plant. This action included the closure of the Crossett Facility, as well as additional corporate and business cost reduction actions. We ceased production at the Crossett Facility in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The actions referenced above, when combined with other targeted workforce reduction initiatives during 2023 and 2024, resulted in the reduction of Ingevity's global workforce by 23 percent. Specific to Performance Chemicals, the reduction represented approximately 40 percent of the reportable segment's workforce. 
 Expected Charges 
 We expect to incur aggregate charges of approximately 350 million associated with the Performance Chemicals' repositioning. This is an increase of approximately 100 million from prior expectations due to the closure of the Crossett Facility. Total expected charges now consist of approximately 250 million in asset-related charges, approximately 25 million in severance and other employee-related costs, and approximately 75 million in other restructuring costs, including 
 31 

decommissioning, dismantling and removal charges, and CTO supply contract termination costs. Through September 30, 2024, we have incurred 297.0 million associated with these actions, including 250.8 million of non-cash asset-related charges and 46.2 million of charges to be settled in cash. As of September 30, 2024, 41.0 million of the charges to be settled in cash have been paid and all non-cash charges have been incurred. In total, we expect approximately 100 million of cash charges, including approximately 10- 15 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 and approximately 20- 25 million during 2025. 
 Inventory Charges 
 The company believes the collective actions of workforce, operational, and regional business exits will hinder our ability to dispose of the associated inventory on hand. As a result, we recorded 3.8 million and 6.3 million of non-cash, lower of cost or market, inventory charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to adjust the carrying value of the impacted inventory to what we expect to realize upon disposal, less disposal costs. These inventory charges are recorded to Cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 CTO Resale Activity 
 The DeRidder Plant closure, and the corresponding reduction in CTO refining capacity, significantly reduced our CTO volume requirements. However, we were obligated under an existing CTO supply contract to purchase CTO volumes through 2025 at amounts in excess of the CTO volumes needed to support our business operations. To manage this excess inventory, we sold CTO volumes (herein referred to as "CTO resales") in the open market. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have incurred 0.8 million and 50.8 million, respectively, of CTO resale losses, which are recorded as Other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 As of July 1, 2024, we terminated the CTO supply contract that resulted in these excess CTO volumes. As consideration for the termination of the CTO supply contract, we made a cash payment in the amount of 50.0 million on July 1, 2024 and an additional cash payment in the amount of 50.0 million. The total charge of 100.0 million was recorded within Other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the termination of this supply contract, the purchases under the CTO supply contract ended effective June 30, 2024. Therefore, we are no longer required to purchase this excess CTO volume through 2025, and as such, we expect to end our CTO resale activity by the end of 2024 and to incur no more than 5.0 million in additional costs as we liquidate the excess CTO resale volumes on hand as of September 30, 2024. 
 Expected Savings and Impact 
 The Performance Chemicals' repositioning is focused on reducing exposure to lower margin end-use markets of our industrial specialties product line, such as adhesives, publication inks, and oilfield, representing approximately 45 percent of our industrial specialties product line historical annualized net sales, and as such, we expect annualized net sales to decrease accordingly. The annualized cash savings we expect to realize from these actions are approximately 95 million to 110 million of which 65 million to 75 million we expect to realize in 2024. These cash savings will be derived from headcount reductions, plant operating efficiencies, and reduced supply chain costs. In addition to the cash savings, annualized depreciation and intangible amortization expense related to asset charges taken through this initiative will decline by approximately 15 million and 17 million, respectively, of which we expect to realize approximately 10 million and 12 million in 2024, respectively. 
 Collectively, these savings are expected to be realized in the following financial statement captions: 70-80 percent in Cost of sales, 15-25 percent in Selling, general, and administrative expenses, and ~5 percent in Research and technical expenses, all presented on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized cash savings of approximately 18 million and 60 million, including 14 million and 46 million in Cost of sales, 3 million and 11 million in Selling, general, and administrative expenses, and 1 million and 3 million in Research and technical expenses, respectively. 
 The charges we currently expect to incur and the savings we expect to obtain in connection with these actions are subject to a number of assumptions and risks, and actual results may differ materially. We may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or in connection with, these actions.

 Q3 2024 Performance Summary 
 The Net sales decrease was driven primarily by the Performance Chemicals' industrial specialties product line due to repositioning actions which included the focus on reducing exposure to lower margin end-use markets and therefore reduced sales during the quarter by approximately 51 million. Also contributing to the lower sales was unfavorable weather in key North American regions impacting our road technologies product line and continued weakness in certain industrial end markets that negatively impacted sales in our industrial specialties product line, slightly offset by an increase in our Advanced Polymer Technologies and Performance Materials reportable segments. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The Net sales decrease of 69.1 million in 2024 was driven by volume declines of 68.7 million (15 percent), primarily in our Performance Chemicals reportable segment, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of 0.8 million (zero percent). This was partially offset by favorable pricing and sales composition (mix) of 0.4 million (zero percent). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The Net sales decrease of 212.8 million in 2024 was driven by volume declines of 199.9 million (15 percent), primarily in our Performance Chemicals reportable segment. Unfavorable pricing and sales composition (mix) of 5.2 million (zero percent) and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of 7.7 million (one percent) also contributed to the decline in Net sales. 
 33 

Gross Profit 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Gross profit increase of 0.9 million was driven primarily by decreased manufacturing costs of 2.8 million, driven by lower input costs in Performance Materials and higher throughput in APT, partially offset by higher CTO costs in Performance Chemicals. The increase was partially offset by unfavorable sales volume of 0.5 million in our Performance Chemicals industrial specialties product line, unfavorable pricing and sales composition (mix) of 0.5 million, primarily in our APT reportable segment, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of 0.9 million. Gross profit includes the realized savings of 14.0 million from the Performance Chemicals repositioning actions initiated in 2023. Refer to the Segment Operating Results section included within this MD A for more information on the drivers to the changes in gross profit period over period for all segments. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Gross profit decrease of 59.6 million was driven primarily by unfavorable sales volume of 27.7 million in our Performance Chemicals industrial specialties product line, and increased manufacturing costs of 22.5 million, mainly driven by higher CTO costs in Performance Chemicals which were partially offset by lower input costs in Performance Materials and higher throughput in APT. The decrease was further driven by unfavorable pricing and sales composition (mix) of 7.9 million primarily within our APT reportable segment, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of 1.5 million. Gross profit includes the realized savings of 46.0 million from the Performance Chemicals repositioning actions initiated in 2023. Refer to the Segment Operating Results section included within this MD A for more information on the drivers to the changes in gross profit period over period for all segments. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") were 38.7 million (10 percent of Net sales) and 40.0 million (nine percent of Net sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall, SG A decreased by approximately 1.3 million or three percent. Our Performance Chemicals' repositioning actions resulted in non-cash reduction of intangible amortization expense of 3.5 million and 3.0 million in cash savings. These combined savings were partially offset by increased spending on commercial activities of 0.4 million and 4.8 million of higher variable incentive compensation, driven by adjustments recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2023, that did not repeat in 2024. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 SG A was 127.3 million (11 percent of Net sales) and 140.3 million (11 percent of Net sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall, SG A decreased by 13.0 million or nine percent driven by our Performance Chemicals' repositioning actions that reduced non-cash intangible amortization expense by 8.6 million and included 11.0 million in cash savings. These combined savings were partially offset by increased spending on commercial activities of 1.1 million and 5.5 million of higher variable incentive compensation, driven by adjustments recognized in 2023 that did not repeat in 2024. 
 Research and technical expenses 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Research and technical expenses as a percentage of Net sales remained relatively consistent period over period, increasing to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and technical expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased due to lower sales. Overall, Research and technical expense decreased by 1.1 million, which included approximately 1.0 million realized from the Performance Chemicals repositioning actions initiated in 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Research and technical expenses as a percentage of Net sales remained consistent period over period, at 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in the overall 3.8 million decrease is approximately 3.0 million realized from the Performance Chemicals repositioning actions initiated in 2023.

Performance Chemicals 
 Q3 2024 Performance Summary 
 Net sales in our Performance Chemicals reportable segment decreased 31 percent compared to the prior year quarter, primarily the result of our Performance Chemicals' repositioning actions that are focused on exiting lower-margin end markets for our Industrial Specialties product line. 
 The road technologies product line net sales decrease of 10.7 million was primarily driven by unfavorable weather conditions in key North American regions. The industrial specialties product line net sales decrease of 68.3 million was primarily driven by lower volumes as a result of our repositioning actions resulting in reduced sales of approximately 51 million, as well as continued weakness in certain industrial end markets. 
 Contributing to the decline in Segment EBITDA was higher CTO costs and unfavorable plant throughput due to continued weakness in industrial demand associated with our industrial specialties product line. Additionally, unfavorable weather conditions in key North American regions impacted our road technologies product line. Slightly offsetting these elevated costs were cost savings realized during the quarter due to the Performance Chemicals' repositioning.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted EBITDA 
 Ingevity has presented the financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, defined below, which has not been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and has provided a reconciliation to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is utilized by management as a measure of profitability. 
 We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides management as well as investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business, because such measure, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure because it excludes the effects of financing and investment activities as well as non-operating activities. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and other (income) charges, net, goodwill impairment charge, acquisition and other-related (income) costs, litigation verdict charges, (loss) gain on strategic investments, loss on CTO resales, CTO supply contract termination charges, and pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment (income) charges, net. 
 This non-GAAP measure is not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP and investors should consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income is set forth within this section.

 _______________ 
 (1) We regularly perform strategic reviews and assess the return on our operations, which sometimes results in a plan to restructure the business. These costs are excluded from our reportable segment results and for the purposes of calculating our non-GAAP financial performance measures. Refer to Note 11 for more information. 
 (2) Refer to Note 7 for more information. 
 (3) Charges represent costs incurred to complete and integrate acquisitions and other strategic investments, and include the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions, and certain legal and professional fees associated with the completion of acquisitions and strategic investments. 
 40 

(4) Due to the DeRidder Plant closure, and the corresponding reduced CTO refining capacity, we were obligated, under an existing CTO supply contract, to purchase CTO through 2025 at amounts in excess of required CTO volumes. As of July 1, 2024, we have terminated the CTO supply contract that resulted in these excess CTO volumes. As a result of the termination of this contract the purchases under the CTO supply contract ended, effective June 30, 2024. Therefore, we are no longer required to purchase this excess CTO volume through 2025, and as such, we expect to end our CTO resale activity by the end of 2024. Since these CTO resale activities are directly attributable to the Performance Chemicals repositioning, that is, they do not represent normal, recurring expenses necessary to operate our business, we have excluded the CTO resale (income) charges for the purposes of calculating our non-GAAP financial performance measures. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss on CTO resales relates to the Performance Chemicals segment. Refer to Note 11 for more information. 
 (5) As consideration for the termination of the CTO supply contract, we made a cash payment in the amount of 50.0 million on July 1, 2024 and an additional cash payment in the amount of 50.0 million on October 8, 2024. Since this contract termination is directly attributable to the Performance Chemicals repositioning, that is, it does not represent normal, recurring expenses necessary to operate our business, we have excluded the CTO supply contract termination charges for the purposes of calculating our non-GAAP financial performance measures. Refer to Note 11 for more information. 
 (6) We exclude gains and losses from strategic investments from our segment results, as well as our non-GAAP financial measures, because we do not consider such gains or losses to be directly associated with the operational performance of the segment. We believe that the inclusion of such gains or losses, would impair the factors and trends affecting the historical financial performance of our reportable segments. We continue to include undistributed earnings or loss, distributions, amortization or accretion of basis differences, and other-than-temporary impairments for equity method investments that we believe are directly attributable to the operational performance of such investments, in our reportable segment results. Refer to Note 4 for more information. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The factors that impacted adjusted EBITDA period to period are the same factors that affected earnings discussed in the Results of Operations and Segment Operating Results sections included within this MD A. 
 Current Full Year Company Outlook vs. Prior Year 
 Net sales are expected to be between 1.40 billion and 1.50 billion for 2024. We expect growth in our Performance Materials reportable segment due to increased pricing on select products that benefited from improved global hybrid automotive production and lower than anticipated battery electric vehicle penetration. The Performance Chemicals reportable segment revenue will reflect the impact of our repositioning to improve profitability by focusing on higher margin end markets, as well as continued weak industrial demand. We expect our road technologies product line revenue to decline when compared to the prior year due to unfavorable weather conditions experienced in North America during 2024. Our Advanced Polymer Technologies reportable segment anticipates revenues flat to the prior year; market improvements in Europe are mostly expected to be more than offset by a challenging China economy and weak industrial demand. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between 350 million and 360 million for 2024. We expect growth in our Performance Materials segment EBITDA, primarily due to improved operational efficiency resulting in lower input costs. Performance Chemicals will continue to be impacted by elevated CTO costs and the slow industrial market recovery. We anticipate that our Advanced Polymer Technologies segment EBITDA will be down versus prior year as pricing strategy is expected to drive volume growth resulting in improved utilization rates, which we expect will be more than offset by unfavorable mix and adverse foreign currency impacts. 
 A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA as projected for 2024 is not provided. Ingevity does not forecast net income as it cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income. These components, net of tax, include further restructuring and other income (charges), net; additional acquisition and other-related income (costs); additional pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment (income) charges; and revisions due to legislative tax rate changes. Additionally, discrete tax items could drive variability in our projected effective tax rate. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures. Further, in the future, other items with similar characteristics to those currently included in adjusted EBITDA, that have a similar impact on comparability of periods, and which are not known at this time, may exist and impact adjusted EBITDA.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The primary source of liquidity for our business is the cash flow provided by operating activities. We expect our cash flow provided by operations combined with cash on hand and available capacity under our revolving credit facility to be sufficient to fund our planned operations and meet our interest and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, our undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility was 244.4 million. Over the next twelve months, we expect to fund the following: interest payments, capital expenditures, debt principal repayments, income tax payments, purchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program (and related excise tax payments), income tax payments, additional spending associated with our Performance Materials' intellectual property litigation, restructuring activities such as the repositioning of our Performance Chemicals reportable segment as further described within Note 11, and consideration for the termination of the CTO supply contract further described within Note 11. In addition, we may also evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, or other transactions to create stockholder value and enhance financial performance. In connection with such transactions, or to fund other anticipated uses of cash, we may modify our existing revolving credit facility, redeem all or part of our outstanding senior notes, seek additional debt financing, issue equity securities, or some combination thereof. 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 135.5 million at September 30, 2024. We continuously monitor deposit concentrations and the credit quality of the financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the credit quality of our insurance providers, customers, and key suppliers. 
 Due to the global nature of our operations, a portion of our cash is held outside the U.S. The cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2024, included 128.5 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash and earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are generally used to finance our foreign operations and their capital expenditures. We believe that our foreign holdings of cash will not have a material adverse impact on our U.S. liquidity. If these earnings were distributed, such amounts could be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the statutory rate less the available foreign tax credits, if any, and could potentially be subject to withholding taxes in the various jurisdictions. The potential tax implications of the repatriation of unremitted earnings are driven by facts at the time of distribution, therefore, it is not practicable to estimate the income tax liabilities that might be incurred if such cash and earnings were repatriated to the U.S. Management does not currently expect to repatriate cash earnings from our foreign operations in order to fund U.S. operations. 
 Debt and Finance Lease Obligations 
 Refer to Note 9 for a summary of our outstanding debt obligations and revolving credit facility. 
 Other Potential Liquidity Needs 
 Share Repurchases 
 On July 25, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500.0 million of our common stock (the "2022 Authorization"), and rescinded the prior outstanding repurchase authorization with respect to the shares that remained unused under the prior authorization. Shares under the 2022 Authorization may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market prevailing conditions and other factors, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased no common stock. At September 30, 2024, 353.4 million remained unused under the 2022 Authorization. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased zero and 92.1 million, inclusive of 0.8 million excise tax, in common stock, representing zero and 1,269,373 shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost per share of zero and 71.93, respectively. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Projected 2024 capital expenditures are 90- 100 million. We have no material commitments associated with these projected capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024 .

Cash flow comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 64.1 158.9 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (51.5) (52.6) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 27.4 (93.4) 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities, which consists of net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items including the cash impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities (i.e., working capital), totaled 64.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, decreased by 94.8 million. This decrease was driven by reduced cash earnings of 123.8 million, CTO supply contract termination payment of 50.0 million, CTO resale cash outflows of 45.0 million, and higher cash interest paid of 3.1 million due primarily to rising interest rates when compared to 2023. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was a net reduction in trade working capital of 79.8 million (including accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable), reduced employee compensation payments of 40.6 million, reduced spending on restructuring initiatives of 2.8 million, and a reduction in tax payments of 3.9 million as a result of the lower cash earnings. 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 51.5 million and was primarily driven by capital expenditures of 52.7 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, capital spending included the base maintenance capital supporting ongoing operations, and growth and cost improvement spending. The decrease in Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities when compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the first quarter 2023 sale of a strategic investment that resulted in a cash inflow of 31.5 million, offset by reduced capital expenditures of 27.9 million. 
 Capital expenditure categories Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions 2024 2023 Maintenance 33.8 44.7 Safety, health and environment 2.4 9.4 Growth and cost improvement 16.5 26.5 Total capital expenditures 52.7 80.6 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 27.4 million and was primarily driven by borrowings on our revolving credit facility and other borrowings of 150.5 million, partially offset by payments on our revolving credit facility of 119.3 million. 
 Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 93.4 million and was primarily driven by payments on our revolving credit facility and other borrowings of 240.1 million, and the repurchase of common stock of 92.1 million, partially offset by borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 239.5 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report. Our critical accounting policies have not substantially changed from those described in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
 We have foreign-based operations, primarily in Europe, South America and Asia, which accounted for approximately 23 percent of our net sales in the first nine months of 2024. We have designated the local currency as the functional currency of our significant operations outside of the U.S. The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling, and the Chinese renminbi. In addition, certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of our foreign operations, we also make inter-company sales. All of this exposes us to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our earnings are therefore subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when the earnings in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. In some cases, to minimize the effects of such fluctuations, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Our largest exposures are to the Chinese renminbi and the euro. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change, excluding the impact of any hedging instruments, in the average Chinese renminbi and euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, would have decreased our net sales and income before income taxes by approximately 12.1 million or one percent, and 4.5 million or one percent, respectively. Comparatively, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change, excluding the impact of any hedging instruments, in the average Chinese renminbi and euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, would have decreased our net sales and income before income taxes by approximately 13.2 million or one percent, and 3.9 million or one percent, respectively. 
 Interest rate risk 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of 200.0 million to manage the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments associated with our existing SOFR-based interest payments, effectively converting 200.0 million of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate. In accordance with the terms of this instrument, we receive floating rate interest payments based upon one-month U.S. dollar SOFR and in return are obligated to pay interest at a fixed rate of 3.84 percent until August 2026. The fair value of the interest rate swap was an asset (liability) of (1.7) million and zero at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 651.6 million of our borrowings, adjusted for our 200.0 million floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, included a variable interest rate component. The weighted average interest rate associated with our variable interest rate borrowings, was 6.67 percent for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the variable interest rate component of our borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 6.5 million or 8 percent. Comparatively, a 100 basis point increase in the variable interest rate component of our borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, would have increased our interest expense by approximately 8.3 million or ten percent. 
 Commodity price risk 
 A portion of our manufacturing costs includes purchased raw materials, which are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with the changes in these commodity prices. 
 44 

Crude tall oil price risk 
 Our results of operations are directly affected by the cost of our raw materials, particularly CTO, which, excluding CTO resales, represented 13 percent and 24 percent of our condensed consolidated cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Raw material CTO spend was approximately 12 million and 123 million, excluding CTO resales, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Comparatively, total raw material CTO spend was approximately 81 million and 221 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Pricing for CTO is driven by the limited supply of the product and competing demands for its use, both of which drive pressure on its price. Our gross profit and margins have been and could continue to be adversely affected by increases in the cost of CTO if we are unable to pass the increases on to our customers. Based on average pricing during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a hypothetical unhedged, unfavorable 10 percent increase in the market price for CTO would have increased our spend by approximately 1.2 million and 12.3 million, respectively, which we may not have been able to pass on to our customers. Comparatively, based on average pricing during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, a hypothetical unhedged, unfavorable 10 percent increase in the market price for CTO would have increased our spend by approximately 8.1 million and 22.1 million, respectively. 
 Other market risks 
 Information about our other remaining market risks for the period ended September 30, 2024, does not differ materially from that discussed under Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Ingevity maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in Ingevity's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These controls and procedures also give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Ingevity's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), together with management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Ingevity's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in Ingevity's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Ingevity's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Information regarding certain of these matters is set forth below and in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies within the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and operating results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in Ingevity's risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 The repositioning of our Performance Chemicals business will negatively impact the company s net sales and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations during this transition period. 
 On November 1, 2023 and July 31, 2024, we announced a number of strategic actions designed to further reposition our Performance Chemicals reportable segment to improve the profitability and reduce the cyclicality of the company as a whole. These initiatives including the closure of our plants in DeRidder, Louisiana and Crossett, Arkansas will focus on reducing exposure to lower margin end-use markets of our industrial specialties product line, such as adhesives, publication inks, and oilfield, approximately 45 percent of our industrial specialties product line historical annualized net sales. 
 We expect to incur aggregate charges of approximately 350 million associated with the Performance Chemicals' repositioning, consisting of approximately 250 million in asset-related charges, approximately 25 million in severance and other employee-related costs, and approximately 75 million in other restructuring costs, including decommissioning, dismantling and removal charges, and CTO supply contract termination costs. The company expects approximately 250 million of the total charges to be non-cash. The charges the company currently expects to incur in connection with these actions, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and risks, and the actual results may differ materially. The company may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or in connection with, these actions. 
 These actions have, and may continue to, adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 There may be negative impacts to our business arising out of the closure of our manufacturing facility in Crossett, Arkansas. 
 On July 31, 2024, we announced our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Crossett, Arkansas (the Crossett Facility ). The anticipated timing, charges, and costs of the closure of the Crossett Facility could materially differ from our estimates if the plant closure results in adverse legal or regulatory actions, if personnel required to effect the shutdown become unavailable, or we are affected by other factors not currently contemplated. 
 Adverse weather conditions may impact the demand for some of our products in our road technologies product line and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our road technologies business is seasonal in nature, with roughly 70 to 75 percent of revenue generated between April and September each year. Adverse weather conditions, which directly affect the ability to engage in paving and/or road marking activity, have had, and going forward may have, an adverse effect on sales in the road technologies product line if such conditions result in lower customer demand due to a shortened season.

 15. Tax Obligations . 
 a. The Grantee acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the affiliate employing or retaining the Grantee (the Employer ), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantee s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.

Further, if the Grantee is subject to Tax- Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, the Grantee acknowledges that the Company and or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
 b. Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company and or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items in the manner determined by the Company and or the Employer from time to time, which may include (i) withholding from the Grantee s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Grantee by the Company and or the Employer (ii) requiring the Grantee to remit the aggregate amount of such Tax-Related Items to the Company in full, in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company or the Employer (iii) the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company to sell on the Participant s behalf a whole number of Shares from those Shares to be issued to the Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (iv) by a net settlement under which the Company reduces the number of shares of Common Stock issued on settlement of the PSUs by the number of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate fair market value that equals the amount of the Tax-Related Items associated with such settlement or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company and permitted by applicable law provided, however, that if the Grantee is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then any Tax-Related Items shall be withheld using alternative (iv) above (unless the 

Exhibit 10.2 

Committee (as constituted in accordance with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act) shall establish an alternate method prior to the taxable or withholding event). 
 c. Depending on the withholding method, the Company or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case the Grantee may receive a refund of any over- withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, the Grantee is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the settled PSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. 
 d. The Grantee further agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Grantee s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares of Common Stock or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock, if the Grantee fails to comply with the Grantee s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
 e. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Grantee agrees that the Grantee is liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenants to pay all such Tax-Related Items as and when requested by the Company or, if different, the Employer or by Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). The Grantee also agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company or the Employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay or withhold or have paid or will pay to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority) on the Grantee s behalf. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Grantee is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), the terms of the immediately foregoing provision will not apply if the indemnification is viewed as a loan. In such case, if the amount of any income tax due is not collected from or paid by the Grantee within 90 days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which an event giving rise to the indemnification described above occurs, the amount of any uncollected income taxes may constitute a benefit to the Grantee on which additional income tax and National Insurance contributions NICs may be payable. The Grantee will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying to the Company or the Employer, as applicable, any employee NICs due on this additional benefit, which the Company or the Employer may recover from the Grantee by any of the means referred to in this Section 14 of the Terms and Conditions.

The Grantee may be required to report such accounts, assets or related transactions to the tax or other authorities in his or her country.
