and during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of August
31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and , respectively. The Company s net
cash inflow provided by operations was during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 

As
of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of and , and current liabilities of 
and respectively. The Company s China subsidiaries and VIE are subject to preapproval from the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange SAFE for non-domestic financing. Additionally, the amount of cash available for transfer from the
China subsidiaries and the VIE for use by the Company s non-China subsidiaries is also limited both by the liquidity needs of the
subsidiaries in China and the restriction on foreign currency exchange by Chinese-government mandated limitations including currency
exchange controls on certain transfers of funds outside of China. 

and as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 respectively. During the period
three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated a net loss and respectively. Furthermore, the Company
recorded a net cash inflow of and from operating activities as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. 

The
Company s cash position is not significant to support the Company s daily operation. While the Company believes in the viability
of its business strategy plans such as Flash Lion e-commerce sales model, Cloud chain (including Wechat, REDnote and Tik Tok s
short videos e-commerce sales model), and its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurance to that effect. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and increase of market
share, our business plan is to extend our market share through acquiring quality businesses in the automotive aftermarket industries,
in order to increase our customer base and supply channels, as well as to acquire more skilled employees and business connections in
the industries. We plan to further develop our online and offline marketing platform and internal enterprise resource planning system
(ERP) by engaging an external IT company during 2025. 

We
plan to diversify our existing product portfolio strategically, and thereby provide our customers with a wider range of choices and broaden
our existing customer base. 

In
addition, major shareholder agrees to provide financial support to the Company. However, management cannot provide any assurances that
the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company believes that the contractual arrangements among its subsidiaries, the VIE and its shareholders are in compliance with the current
PRC laws and legally enforceable. However, uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of the PRC laws, regulations and policies
could limit the Company s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. As a result, the Company may be unable to consolidate
the VIE and its subsidiary in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company s ability to control its VIE
also depends on the authorization by the shareholders of the VIE to exercise voting rights on all matters requiring shareholders 
approval in the VIE. The Company believes that the agreements on authorization to exercise shareholder s voting power are legally
enforceable. In addition, if the legal structure and contractual arrangements with its VIE were found to be in violation of any future
PRC laws and regulations, the Company may be subject to fines or other actions. The Company believes the possibility that it will no
longer be able to control and consolidate its VIE as a result of the aforementioned risks and uncertainties is remote.

equity interest of HZ CXJ. The Company are an automobile aftermarket products wholesaler,
as well as an auto detailing store consultancy company in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province through this acquisition. The purchase consideration
is , consists of shares of the Company s common stock issued to HZ CXJ s original owner fair valued at
the acquisition date. These shares were issued on May 28, 2020. The Company accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of
accounting for business combination under ASC 805. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. 

The
determination of fair values involves the use of significant judgment and estimates and in the case of HZ CXJ, this is with specific
reference to acquired intangible asset. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, as well as the intangible asset life and the expected future cash flows and related discount rate, can materially impact the
Company s consolidated financial statements. Significant inputs and assumptions used for the model included the amount and timing
of expected future cash flows and discount rate. The Company utilized the assistance of a third-party valuation appraiser to determine
the fair value as of the date of acquisition.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment annually as of the first day of fiscal May or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that impairment may have occurred. The Company performed its fourth quarter 2024 annual goodwill impairment test using a quantitative
assessment for its HZ CXJ reporting unit. The quantitative assessment for HZ CXJ reporting unit indicated that its carrying amount exceeded
its fair value, and resulted in an impairment charge of in the fourth quarter of 2024. This non-cash impairment charge is
presented within the General Administrative Expenses line for 2024 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As
at August 31, 2024, the goodwill balance is . 

The
fair value estimate for the HZ CXJ reporting unit was based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows
and market value approach. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow model included the Company s weighted average
cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. Significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying
similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable
revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. 

The
decline in the fair value of the HZ CXJ s reporting unit has mainly resulted from changes to its projected revenue growth rates
and timeline, which were finalized during the Company s annual long-term planning process in the fourth quarter of 2024. The HZ
CXJ reporting unit has been in operation since June 2019, therefore the Company has less experience estimating the operating performance
of this reporting unit. The Company s expected revenue increase has been slower than anticipated due to the time required to ramp
up activity for new customers. In addition, during its long-term planning process performed, the Company made adjustments to reduce its
forecasted spend on HZ CXJ in 2025 and beyond, which further impacted expected revenue growth rates and their timing. These changes in
critical assumptions related to the reporting unit resulted in a reduction in its estimated fair value. 

The
Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. If the operating results of the Company s reporting units
deteriorate in the future, it may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting
in additional goodwill impairment charges. 

The
goodwill value is occurred on the acquisition. The impairment loss on goodwill of and , were recognized
during the year ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. The impairment loss on goodwill of and , were recognized during the three
months period ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. As of August 31, 2024, the balance of goodwill is . 

During
the annual impairment assessment, a quantitative assessment was conducted, which involved estimating the fair value of the reporting
unit using the income approach. 

Key
assumptions in the quantitative assessment included: 

(i)
Discount rate: 

(ii)
Projected sales and cost of sales: 

(iii)
Terminal growth rate: 

(iv)
Inflation rate: 

The
use of the estimates in the quantitative assessment are highly judgmental and actual results may differ significantly from what is currently
assessed. Accordingly, fluctuations in any of the key attributes may result in a significant change in the projected cashflows underlying
the quantitative assessment, which could have a material impact on the assessed values of goodwill.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Since
commencing operations, our primary uses of cash have been to finance working capital needs for have financed these requirements primarily
from cash generated from operations and related party advances. 

We
are in start-up stage operations and have generated limited revenues. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment
of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services
and products.

We
expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily
with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows. 

We
may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments. If these sources
are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility.
The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could contractually result in additional dilution to stockholders. The incurrence
of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict
operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

a decrease of cash flow 24,587. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is mainly due to decrease cash flow of advance

liabilities and other payable 12,199, operating lease liabilities 9,008, accounts receivable 872, and offset net cash inflow of decrease

People s Republic of China. There is no assurance that exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. Dollar will remain stable. Inflation
