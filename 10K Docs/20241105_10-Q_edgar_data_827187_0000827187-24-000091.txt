Income Taxes 
 Income tax benefit totaled million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 , compared with income tax 
 expense of million last year . The change in income tax expense was primarily due to the change in (loss) income 
 before income taxes levels and the impact of discrete tax expenses. Discrete tax expense, primarily stock-based 
 compensation tax shortfalls, was million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 , compared to million 
 for the same period last year.

 million . The credit 
 facility is for general corporate purposes and to meet sea sonal working capital requirements. The Amended and 
 Restated Credit and Security Agreement, dated February 14, 2018, among the Company, U.S. Bank National Association 
 and the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto (as amended, the Credit 
 Agreement), includes an accordion feature which allows the Company to increase the amount of the credit facility from 
 million to billion , subject to lenders approval. The Credit Agreement provides the lenders with a collateral 
 security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets and those of its subsidiaries and requires the Company to 
 comply with, among other things, a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. 
 The maximum net leverage ratio permitted by the Credit Agreement is to 1.00 for the quarterly period ended 
 September 28, 2024 ; to 1.00 for the quarterly reporting period ending December 28, 2024 ; and to 1.00 for 
 each quarterly reporting period occurring thereafter until maturity. 
 The minimum interest coverage ratio permitted by the Credit Agreement is to 1.00 for both quarterly reporting 
 periods ending September 28, 2024 and December 28, 2024 ; and to 1.00 for each quarterly reporting period 
 occurring thereafter until maturity. 
 The carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement approximates fair value because 
 interest rates approximate the current rates available to the Company. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the 
 Company pays a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on its leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement 
 matures in December 2026 . The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 28, 2024 .

 The Company s operating lease costs include facility, vehicle and equipment lease costs, but exclude variable lease 
 costs. Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, after consideration of rent 
 escalations and rent holidays. The lease term for purposes of the calculation begins on the earlier of the lease 
 commencement date or the date the Company takes possession of the property. During lease renewal negotiations that 
 extend beyond the original lease term, the Company estimates straight-line rent expense based on current market 
 conditions. Variable lease costs are recorded when it is probable the cost has been incurred and the amount can be 
 reasonably estimated. 
 At September 28, 2024 , the Company s finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were not significant.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to provide 
 a reader of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of 
 management on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect the 
 Company s future results. MD A is presented in seven sections: 
 Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors 
 Business Overview 
 Results of Operations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Non-GAAP Data Reconciliations 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors 
 The discussion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements that relate to 
 future plans, events, financial results or performance. You can identify forward-looking statements by those that 
 are not historical in nature, particularly those that use terminology such as may, will, should, could, 
 expect, anticipate, believe, estimate, plan, project, predict, intend, potential, continue or 
 the negative of these or similar terms. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could 
 cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s historical experience and its present expectations or 
 projections. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: 
 Changes in economic conditions and consumer sentiment and related impacts on discretionary consumer spending; 
 Increases in interest rates, which have increased the cost of servicing the Company s indebtedness; 
 Availability of attractive and cost-effective consumer credit options; 
 Ability to achieve savings and efficiencies from cost savings plans related to business restructuring actions and to 
 avoid unexpected adverse effects; 
 Dependence on, and ability to maintain working relationships and favorable contractual terms with key suppliers and 
 third parties; 
 Fluctuations in commodity costs or third-party delivery or logistics costs and other inflationary pressures; 
 Risks inherent in global-sourcing activities, including tariffs, foreign regulation, geo-political turmoil, war, pandemics, 
 labor challenges, foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, and climate or other disasters, and resulting supply 
 shortages and production and delivery delays and disruptions; 
 Operating with minimal levels of inventory, which may leave the Company vulnerable to supply shortages, as well as 
 carrying excess levels of inventory for various products from time to time, which may leave the Company vulnerable 
 to inventory obsolescence and write-downs; 
 The effectiveness of the Company s marketing strategy and promotional efforts; 
 The execution of the Company s Total Retail distribution strategy; 
 Ability to achieve and maintain high levels of product quality and to improve and expand the product line; 
 Ability to protect the Company s technology, trademarks, and brand and the adequacy of its intellectual property

Results of Operations 
 Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results 
 Quarterly and year-to-date operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including 
 increases or decreases in sales, timing, amount and effectiveness of advertising expenditures, changes in sales return 
 rates or warranty experience, timing of investments in growth initiatives and infrastructure, timing of store openings/ 
 closings and related expenses, changes in net sales resulting from changes in the Company s store base, timing of new 
 product introductions and related expenses, timing of promotional offerings, competitive factors, changes in commodity 
 costs, disruptions in global supplies or third-party service providers, seasonality of retail and bedding industry sales, 
 consumer sentiment and general economic conditions. The extent to which these external factors will impact the 
 Company s business and its consolidated financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly 
 uncertain and cannot be predicted. Therefore, the historical results of operations may not be indicative of the results that 
 may be achieved for any future period. 
 Highlights 
 Financial highlights for the three months ended September 28, 2024 were as follow s: 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 of 427 million decreased 10 from 473 million for the 
 same period one year ago due to t he ongoing weakness in the mattress industry and consumers continuing to 
 scrutinize their spending. 
 The net sales change resulted from a 9 comparable sales decrease in Total Retail. For additional details, see the 
 components of total net sales change on page 19 . 
 Average sales per store (sales for stores open at least one year, Total Retail, including online, phone and chat) on a 
 trailing twelve-month basis for the period ended September 28, 2024 totaled 2.7 million , compared with 3.0 
 million for the same period last year. 
 Operating income for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was 8 million , compared with 5 million in the 
 prior-year period. The 3 million in crease in operating income was driven by a 15 million reduction in operating 
 expenses and a 3.4 ppt. increase in the gross profit rate, offset by lower net sales. Operating expenses for the three 
 months ended September 28, 2024 included 2 million of restructuring costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was 28 million , compared to 25 million in the 
 prior-year period as ongoing gross margin improvements and cost reduction actions partially offset the year-over- 
 year net sales decline. 
 Gross profit rate of 60.8 was 3.4 ppt. higher than the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to year- 
 over-year product cost reductions through value engineering and ongoing supplier negotiations and favorable 
 product mix . See the gross profit discussion on page 20 for additional details. 
 The 15 million year-over-year reduction in the Company s operating expenses was due to lower sales and 
 marketing and research and development expenses, partly offset by 2 million of restructuring costs. 
 Net loss for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was 3 million , compared with a net loss of 2 million for 
 the same period one year ago. Net loss per diluted share was 0.14 , compared with a net loss per diluted share of 
 0.10 for the comparable period one year ago. 
 The Company s adjusted return on invested capital (Adjusted ROIC) was 4.5 on a trailing twelve-month basis for 
 the period ended September 28, 2024 , compared with 14.9 for the comparable period one year ago. 
 The Company generated 51 million in cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 28, 
 2024 , compared with 32 million for the same period one year ago. 
 Free cash flow provided 34 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 , compared with using 16 
 million for the same period one year ago. 
 As of September 28, 2024 , the Company had 517 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

 Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) 
 The Company defines earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) as net income 
 plus: income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring 
 costs and asset impairments. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful indicator of its financial performance 
 and its ability to generate cash from operating activities. The Company s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be 
 comparable to similarly titled definitions used by other companies. The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, which 
 is a non-GAAP financial measure, to the comparable GAAP financial measure.

 Return on Invested Capital (Adjusted ROIC) 
 Adjusted ROIC is a financial measure the Company uses to determine how efficiently it deploys its capital. It quantifies 
 the return the Company earns on its adjusted invested capital. Management believes Adjusted ROIC is also a useful 
 metric for investors and financial analysts. The Company computes Adjusted ROIC as outlined below. Its definition and 
 calculation of Adjusted ROIC may not be comparable to similarly titled definitions and calculations used by other 
 companies.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is exposed to changes in market-based short-term interest rates that will impact net interest expense. If 
 overall interest rates were one percentage point higher than current rates, annual net income would decrease by 
 4.2 million based on the 517 million of borrowings under the credit facility at September 28, 2024 . The Company does 
 not manage the interest-rate volatility risk of borrowings under the credit facility through the use of derivative 
 instruments. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are 
 designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under 
 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time 
 periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is 
 accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal 
 financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required 
 disclosure. The Company s management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial 
 officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as 
 of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, its principal executive officer and 
 principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end 
 of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended 
 September 28, 2024 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal 
 control over financial reporting.
