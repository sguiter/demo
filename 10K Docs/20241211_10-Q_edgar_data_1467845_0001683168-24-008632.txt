Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

This section of this report includes a number of forward-looking
statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are often
identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions or words which, by their nature,
refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this
report. These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from historical results or our predictions. 

Overview 

On July 27, 2015, the Company approved and effected a name change to
Kashin, Inc. Kashin, Inc. fka Singular Chef, Inc. ("the Company", "our" or "we") was incorporated in the
State of Nevada as a for-profit company on April 09, 2009. The Company is a development stage company that intends to provide specialized
step-by-step cooking tutorials through the website we are currently developing for monthly subscribers and on pay-per-view basis. 

Results of Operations 

The Company has not yet generated any revenue from its operations and
has generated no revenues unrelated to its operations. Expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2023, were 8,574 resulting in
a net loss of 39,604 as compared to expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2022 of 5,892 resulting in a net loss of 5,892.
The net loss of 39,604 for the six months ended October 31, 2023 is a result of Revenues of Nil, Office and general expenses of 8,804
consisting primarily of transfer agent fees and Professional Fees of 31,800 as compared to the net loss of 33,099 for the six months
ended October 31, 2022 is a result of Revenues of Nil, Office and general expenses of 33,099 consisting primarily of transfer agent
fees and Professional Fees. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning
that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital.
No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have implemented our plan of operations. With the exception of cash advances from our
sole Officer and Director, our only source for cash at this time is investments by others. We must raise cash to implement our strategy
and stay in business. 

For the period ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, the Company
had cash of 31 and Nil respectively. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the period ended October 31, 2023 were 23,234. The
funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the planned operations of the Company and maintain a reporting status. 

As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company has received
 1,295 in loans and payment of expenses from a related party. As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, a second related party has paid
expenses of 1,295 respectively, on behalf of the Company. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

Other than the situation described in the section titled Capital Recourses
and Liquidity, the company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
or change on the company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement
or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party, under which the company has (i) any obligation
arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred
to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

The Company is a smaller reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2
of the Securities Act of 1934 and we are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In connection with this quarterly report, as required by Rule 15d-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company's
disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company's
management, including our company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that subject to the inherent limitations noted in this Part II,
Item 9A(T) as of October 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses
in our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
