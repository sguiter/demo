All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, capital actions or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as will likely result, may, are expected to, is anticipated, potential, estimate, forecast, projected, intends to, or may include other similar words or phrases such as believes, plans, trend, objective, continue, remain, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, might, can, or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us. There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) deteriorating credit quality; (2) loan concentration by location or industry of borrowers or collateral; (3) problems encountered by other financial institutions; (4) inadequate sources of funding or liquidity; (5) unfavorable actions of rating agencies; (6) inability to maintain or grow deposits; (7) limitations on the ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries; (8) cyber-security risks; (9) Fifth Third s ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; (10) failures by third-party service providers; (11) inability to manage strategic initiatives and/or organizational changes; (12) inability to implement technology system enhancements; (13) failure of internal controls and other risk management programs; (14) losses related to fraud, theft, misappropriation or violence; (15) inability to attract and retain skilled personnel; (16) adverse impacts of government regulation; (17) governmental or regulatory changes or other actions; (18) failures to meet applicable capital requirements; (19) regulatory objections to Fifth Third s capital plan; (20) regulation of Fifth Third s derivatives activities; (21) deposit insurance premiums; (22) assessments for the orderly liquidation fund; (23) weakness in the national or local economies; (24) global political and economic uncertainty or negative actions; (25) changes in interest rates and the effects of inflation; (26) changes and trends in capital markets; (27) fluctuation of Fifth Third s stock price; (28) volatility in mortgage banking revenue; (29) litigation, investigations, and enforcement proceedings by governmental authorities; (30) breaches of contractual covenants, representations and warranties; (31) competition and changes in the financial services industry; (32) potential impacts of the adoption of real-time payment networks; (33) changing retail distribution strategies, customer preferences and behavior; (34) difficulties in identifying, acquiring or integrating suitable strategic partnerships, investments or acquisitions; (35) potential dilution from future acquisitions; (36) loss of income and/or difficulties encountered in the sale and separation of businesses, investments or other assets; (37) results of investments or acquired entities; (38) changes in accounting standards or interpretation or declines in the value of Fifth Third s goodwill or other intangible assets; (39) inaccuracies or other failures from the use of models; (40) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments or the use of inaccurate estimates; (41) weather-related events, other natural disasters, or health emergencies (including pandemics); (42) the impact of reputational risk created by these or other developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity; (43) changes in law or requirements imposed by Fifth Third s regulators impacting our capital actions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (44) Fifth Third s ability to meet its environmental and/or social targets, goals and commitments. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as may be required by law, and we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

 The following is Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp s (the Bancorp or Fifth Third financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 
 Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At September 30, 2024, the Bancorp had 214 billion in assets and operated 1,072 full-service banking centers and 2,060 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. 
 
 This overview of MD A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD A. 
 
 The Bancorp s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 67 and 33 of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 
 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 
 
 Noninterest income is derived from wealth and asset management revenue, service charges on deposits, commercial banking revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, leasing business revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, marketing expense, leasing business expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 
 
 FDIC Special Assessment 
 In response to the bank closures that occurred in the first half of 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule for a special deposit insurance assessment on banking organizations with greater than 5 billion in assets to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors. The Bancorp s initial estimate of its allocated share of the special assessment under the provisions of the final rule was 224 million, which was recognized in earnings upon issuance of the final rule in November 2023. 
 
 Subsequently, in 2024, the FDIC has announced that it expects to incur additional losses related to these bank closures beyond its initial estimates, resulting in an increase to the amount of the special assessment allocated to each member bank. As of September 30, 2024, the

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Bancorp s estimate of its allocation of the special assessment was 263 million, based on the most recent information provided by the FDIC. As a result, the Bancorp recorded an incremental expense of 39 million during the first six months of 2024. The Bancorp currently expects to pay the special assessment to the FDIC over a total of ten quarterly assessment periods, which began with the first quarter of 2024. The estimate of the cost associated with protecting the uninsured depositors will continue to be subject to periodic adjustment until the final loss amount is determined by the FDIC. 
 
 Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions totaling 200 million and 325 million, respectively. Refer to Note 17 and Note 25 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. 
 
 Senior Notes Offerings 
 On January 29, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold 1.0 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on January 29, 2032. The senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.631 per annum until January 28, 2031. From January 29, 2031 until maturity, the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.840 . 
 
 On September 6, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold 750 million of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on September 6, 2030. The senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.895 per annum until September 5, 2029. From September 6, 2029 until maturity, the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.486 . 
 
 Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 
 Transfer of Securities 
 In January 2024, the Bancorp transferred 12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to reflect the Bancorp s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD A for more information. 
 
 CFPB Settlements 
 On July 9, 2024, the Bank and the CFPB agreed to resolve previously outstanding litigation which alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act. The Bank agreed to the entry of a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order, pursuant to which the Bank, without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the suit except as specified in the order, agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of 15 million, agreed to maintain existing policies around its consumer sales incentives, agreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its account opening practices comply with law and the order and agreed to provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers with checking, savings, or credit card accounts opened beginning January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2016. 
 
 Concurrently, the Bank also agreed to entry of a Consent Order related to a since-discontinued program in its auto lending business that placed collateral protection insurance on certain automobile loans. Under this Consent Order, without admitting or denying any of the findings of fact or conclusions of law (except to establish jurisdiction), the Bank agreed to pay a 5 million civil monetary penalty related to those issues, maintain existing policy changes related to its auto servicing practices, agreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its compliance with the order and provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers within a redress period beginning July 21, 2011 and ending December 31, 2020. 
 
 Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these settlements. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 
 
 The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp s compensation programs: 
 
 CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 
 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 
 4 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Return on Average Common Equity, Excluding AOCI (non-GAAP): Net income available to common shareholders divided by total equity, excluding AOCI and preferred stock 
 Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets 
 Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 
 Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 
 Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 
 Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases 
 Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets 
 Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits

 Earnings Summary 
 The Bancorp s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was 532 million, or 0.78 per diluted share, which was net of 41 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp s net income available to co mmon shareholders for the third quarter of 2023 w as 623 million, or 0.91 per diluted share, which was net of 37 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 w as 1.6 billion, or 2.28 per diluted share, which was net of 121 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp s net income available to common shareholde rs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.7 billion, or 2.50 per diluted share, which was net of 100 million in pref erred stock dividends. 
 
 Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 1.4 billion and 4.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, decreasing 18 million and 219 million compared to the same periods in the prior year. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in market interest rates and deposit balance migration into higher yielding products as well as decreases in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in the average balances of other short-term investments and increases in yields on

 average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.90 and 2.88 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.98 and 3.12 for the comparable periods in the prior year. 
 
 The provision for credit losses was 160 million and 351 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 119 million and 460 million during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused an increase in the ACL from June 30, 2024, primarily including the recognition of specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial and industrial loans, slight deterioration in the economic forecast and changes in loan mix. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused a decrease in the ACL from December 31, 2023, including improvement in the economic forecast used to calculate the ACL and lower period-end loan and lease balances. Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.48 and 0.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.45 and 0.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.62 and 0.59 , respectively. For more information on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Noninterest income decreased 4 million and 20 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income, leasing business revenue and mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by increases in wealth and asset management revenue, services charges on deposits and net securities gains. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased 56 million and 57 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense and technology and communications expense, partially offset by decreases in leasing business expense and marketing expense. 
 
 For more information on net interest income, provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD A.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 
 The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 
 
 The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

 The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

 The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:

 The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

 RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of a significant accounting standard issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The Bancorp s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding (including CDs over 250,000, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity. 
 
 Tables 5 and 6 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 
 
 Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 1.4 billion and 4.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, decreasing 18 million and 219 million compared to the same periods in the prior year. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in market interest rates and deposit balance migration into higher yielding products as well as decreases in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in the average balances of other short-term investments and increases in yields on average interest-earning assets. 
 
 Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.05 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.13 and 2.35 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 28 bps and 69 bps, partially offset by increases in yields on average interest-earning assets of 20 bps and 39 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.90 and 2.88 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.98 and 3.12 for the comparable periods in the prior year. Net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the previously mentioned impacts of higher market interest rates, migration of average balances of deposits from demand deposits to interest-bearing deposits and decreases in average balances of loans and leases. Net interest margin results are expected to modestly increase over the next several quarters driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and moderating deposit costs. However, net interest margin may be negatively impacted by increased deposit competition or higher levels of cash and other short-term investments. 
 
 Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased 11 million and 195 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by increases in yields on loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in average balances of commercial and industrial loans. For more information on the Bancorp s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased 128 million and 589 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in the average balances of other short-term investments. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by an increase in yields on average taxable securities. 
 
 Interest expense on average core deposits increased 153 million and 905 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 297 bps and 295 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 265 bps and 219 
 9 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and greater competition for deposits. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also driven by increases in the average balances of interest-bearing core deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD A for additional information on the Bancorp s deposits. 
 
 Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased 4 million and 98 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in the average balances of long-term debt. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of CDs over 250,000. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by an increase in the rates paid on average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of FHLB advances. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD A for additional information on the Bancorp s borrowings. Average wholesale funding represented 16 of average interest-bearing liabilities for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17 and 18 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For more information on the Bancorp s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD A.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded commitments that is based on factors discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 
 
 The provision for credit losses was 160 million and 351 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 119 million and 460 million during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused an increase in the ACL from June 30, 2024, primarily including the recognition of specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial and industrial loans, slight deterioration in the economic forecast and changes in loan mix. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was affected by factors that caused a decrease in the ACL from December 31, 2023, including improvement in the economic forecast used to calculate the ACL and lower period-end loan and lease balances. 
 
 The ALLL decreased 17 million from December 31, 2023 to 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024. The ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 1.98 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments decreased 28 million from December 31, 2023 to 138 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 2.09 , compared to 2.12 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income decreased 4 million and 20 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following table presents the components of noninterest income: 
 TABLE 7: Components of Noninterest Income For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Wealth and asset management revenue 163 145 12 483 434 11 Service charges on deposits 161 149 8 467 431 8 Commercial banking revenue 163 154 6 451 461 (2) Card and processing revenue 106 104 2 316 310 2 Mortgage banking net revenue 50 57 (12) 154 184 (16) Leasing business revenue 43 58 (26) 120 162 (26) Other noninterest income 15 55 (73) 103 152 (32) Securities gains (losses), net 10 (7) NM 23 3 667 Total noninterest income 711 715 (1) 2,117 2,137 (1) 
 
 Wealth and asset management revenue 
 Wealth and asset management revenue increased 18 million and 49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by increases in personal asset management revenue and brokerage income. The Bancorp s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately 635 billion and 547 billion in total assets under care as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and managed 69 billion and 57 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Service charges on deposits 
 Service charges on deposits increased 12 million and 36 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in service charges on commercial deposits. Service charges on commercial deposits were 120 million and 350 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increasing 11 million and 35 million from the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in revenue from commercial payments activities, which include traditional treasury management and embedded payments. Service charges on consumer

 deposits were 41 million and 117 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 40 million and 116 million for the same periods in the prior year. 
 
 Commercial banking revenue 
 Commercial banking revenue increased 9 million and decreased 10 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in corporate bond fees, partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange fees. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by decreases in revenue from commercial customer derivatives, foreign exchange fees and loan syndication revenue, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond fees. 
 
 Card and processing revenue 
 Card and processing revenue increased 2 million and 6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in electronic funds transfer income. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included an increase in credit and debit card interchange, partially offset by increased reward costs. 
 
 Mortgage banking net revenue 
 Mortgage banking net revenue decreased 7 million and 30 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 
 TABLE 8: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Origination fees and gains on loan sales 18 19 50 59 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 77 79 233 241 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs 
 (45) (41) (129) (116) Net mortgage servicing revenue 32 38 104 125 Total mortgage banking net revenue 50 57 154 184 
 
 Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased 1 million and 9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by the impact of gains recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 from sales of forbearance loans that were repurchased from GNMA, partially offset by the impacts of mark-to-market adjustments recognized on held for investment loans measured at fair value. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to 1.9 billion from 1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates on originations. Residential mortgage loan originations were 4.6 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The following table presents the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the Bancorp s non-qualifying hedging strategy:

 The Bancorp recognized losses of 90 million and 112 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio, compared to gains of 34 million and losses of 6 million for the same periods in the prior year. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included a decrease of 49 million and an increase of 1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and increases of 73 million and 107 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which caused an increase in prepayment speeds. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased 41 million and 113 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and decreased 39 million and 113 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 
 
 Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. Net gains and losses on these securities were immaterial for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The Bancorp s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 112.4 billion and 118.5 billion, respectively, with 95.8 billion and 101.9 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 
 
 Leasing business revenue 
 Leasing business revenue decreased 15 million and 42 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in operating lease income, lease remarketing fees and lease syndication revenue. 
 
 Other noninterest income 
 The following table presents the components of other noninterest income: 
 TABLE 10: Components of Other Noninterest Income For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 BOLI income 16 15 49 45 Cardholder fees 14 15 41 43 Private equity investment income 12 13 33 39 Banking center income 7 7 20 19 Consumer loan fees 6 5 16 15 Equity method investment income 5 3 13 48 Gains on sale of businesses 1 2 7 Loss on swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares (47) (10) (87) (72) Other, net 1 5 11 15 Total other noninterest income 15 55 103 152 
 
 Other noninterest income decreased 40 million and 49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included a decrease in equity method investment income. 
 
 The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of 47 million and 87 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to negative valuation adjustments of 10 million and 72 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity method investment income decreased 35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a gain on the partial disposition of an equity method investment during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Securities gains (losses), net 
 Net securities gains were 10 million and 23 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to losses of 7 million and gains of 3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Other noninterest expense increased 7 million and 12 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 
 Other noninterest expense included the impacts of FDIC insurance and other taxes, which increased 33 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the incremental expenses associated with the Bancorp s updated estimate of its allocated share of the FDIC s special assessment, as further discussed in the Overview section of MD A. 

Applicable Income Taxes 
 The Bancorp s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 
 TABLE 13: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income before income taxes 728 846 2,151 2,338 Applicable income tax expense 155 186 457 519 Effective tax rate 21.3 22.0 21.3 22.2 
 
 Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Research Credit under Section 41 of the IRC, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC, and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 
 
 The effective tax rate decreased to 21.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.0 for the same period in the prior year primarily related to an increase in tax credits and an increase in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.2 for the same period in the prior year primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets for changes in certain state tax laws which were enacted during the second quarter of 2024 as well as a decrease in state tax expense associated with the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits.

 116,668 117,234 
 
 Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, decreased 332 million from December 31, 2023 driven by a decrease in commercial loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in consumer loans. 
 
 Commercial loans and leases decreased 1.6 billion, or 2 , from December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by increases in commercial construction loans, commercial leases and commercial mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans decreased 2.4 billion, or 4 , from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of payoffs exceeding loan originations. Commercial construction loans increased 376 million, or 7 , from December 31, 2023 as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial leases increased 293 million, or 11 , from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in lease originations. Commercial mortgage loans increased 152 million, or 1 , from December 31, 2023 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. 
 
 Consumer loans increased 1.2 billion, or 3 , from December 31, 2023 due to increases in indirect secured consumer loans, solar energy installation loans, residential mortgage loans and home equity, partially offset by decreases in other consumer loans and credit card. Indirect secured consumer loans increased 977 million, or 7 , from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by loan production exceeding payoffs. Solar energy installation loans increased 350 million, or 9 , from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increased loan originations. Residential mortgage loans increased 318 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in loan production. Home equity loans increased 158 million, or 4 , from December 31, 2023 as loan originations and new advances exceeded payoffs. Other consumer loans decreased 413 million, or 14 , from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022. Credit card decreased 162 million, or 9 , from December 31, 2023 primarily due to paydowns of seasonally elevated year-end balances.

 Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, decreased 4.9 billion, or 4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by decreases in average commercial loans and leases and average consumer loans. 
 
 Average commercial loans and leases decreased 4.6 billion, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by increases in average commercial construction loans and average commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased 5.4 billion, or 9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023. Average commercial construction loans increased 442 million, or 8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. 
 Average commercial mortgage loans increased 272 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year as loan originations exceeded payoffs. 
 
 Average consumer loans decreased 248 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average other consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in average solar energy installation loans. Average other consumer loans decreased 492 million, or 16 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022. Average residential mortgage loans decreased 415 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023 and a decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average solar energy installation loans increased 745 million, or 23 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased loan originations.

 Investment Securities 
 The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were 53.4 billion and 51.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 3.9 at September 30, 2024 compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2023. The taxable held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.6 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading typically when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne ar term. At September 30, 2024 , the Bancorp s investment securities portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp did not recognize an allowance for credit losses for its investment securities. The Bancorp also did not recognize provision for credit losses for investment securities during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The Bancorp recognized impairment losses on available-for-sale debt and other securities of 11 million and 21 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with impairment losses of 1 million and 5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These losses were included in securities gains (losses), net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions where the Bancorp had determined that it no longer intended to hold the securities until the recovery of their amortized cost bases. 
 
 The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:

 In January 2024, the Bancorp transferred 12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to reflect the Bancorp s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential

 mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. On the date of the transfer, pre-tax unrealized losses of 994 million were included in AOCI related to these transferred securities. The unrealized losses that existed on the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a component of AOCI and will be amortized into income over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the amortization of the discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. 
 
 The following table presents the estimated future amortization of unrealized losses related to securities transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. At September 30, 2024, these transferred securities had an estimated weighted-average life of 6.9 years.

 On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities comprised 28 of total interest-earning assets at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 5.1 years and 6.2 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.10 and 3.06 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an estimated weighted-average life of 6.9 years and a weighted-average yield of 3.41 . 
 
 Information presented in Tables 18 and 19 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. 
 
 The fair values of investment securities are impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen. Total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were 3.4 billion and 5.4 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Other Short-Term Investments 
 Other short-term investments have original maturities less than one year and primarily include interest-bearing balances that are funds on deposit at the FRB or other depository institutions. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments were 21.7 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 353 million from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily associated with decreases in total borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease balances during the same period.

 Deposits 
 The Bancorp s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 77 of average total assets for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The following table presents the end of period components of deposits:

 Core deposits increased 1.4 billion, or 1 , from December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in CDs 250,000 or less. Transaction deposits increased 1.4 billion, or 1 , from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in money market deposits and interest checking deposits, partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and savings deposits. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-bearing products. Money market deposits increased 3.1 billion, or 9 , from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of higher balances per consumer customer account due to higher offering rates and the aforementioned balance migration. Interest checking deposits increased 1.3 billion, or 2 , from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration, partially offset by lower balances per customer account. Demand deposits decreased 1.8 billion, or 4 , from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration and lower balances per consumer customer account. Savings deposits decreased 1.2 billion, or 7 , from December 31, 2023 primarily due to lower average balances per consumer customer account, driven by increased consumer spending and the impact of consumer preferences for products with higher offering rates. CDs 250,000 or less decreased 72 million, or 1 , from December 31, 2023 primarily due to maturities which outpaced new issuances given current market conditions. 
 
 CDs over 250,000 decreased 1.9 billion, or 37 , from December 31, 2023 primarily due to maturities of retail brokered CDs.

 On an average basis, core deposits increased 4.0 billion, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average transaction deposits and average CDs 250,000 or less. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-bearing products. Average transaction deposits increased 3.1 billion, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits, partially offset by decreases in average demand deposits and average savings deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased 5.3 billion, or 10 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration as well as average commercial balance growth, partially offset by lower average balances per consumer customer account. Average money market deposits increased 5.2 billion, or 16 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per consumer customer account due to higher offering rates and the aforementioned balance migration.

 (a) Includes CDs 250,000 or less and CDs over 250,000. 
 
 Deposit insurance 
 The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over 250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 96.7 billion, or 57 , and 97.6 billion, or 58 , respectively, of the Bancorp s domestic deposits were estimated to be insured. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 71.5 billion and 71.1 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp s domestic deposits were estimated to be uninsured. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 1.0 billion and 1.9 billion, respectively, of time deposits were estimated to be uninsured. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank s regulators.

 Borrowings 
 The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities we re 14 and 13 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings:

 Total borr owings decreased 745 million , or 4 , fro m December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in other short-term borrowings partially offset by an increase in long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings decreased 1.4 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the maturity of FHLB advances, which were not replaced due to reduced short-term funding needs. T he level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, ref er to Note 15 of th e Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term debt increased 716 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in January and September of 2024 totaling 1.8 billion, long-term FHLB advances of 1.5 billion and fair value adjustments of 76 million associated with hedged long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by the redemptions or maturities of 2.3 billion of notes and 382 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations.

 Total average borrowin gs increased 1.6 billion, or 8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in average other short-term borrowings. Average long-term debt increased 2.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by long-term debt transactions occurring since September 30, 2023, including the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in January and September of 2024 totaling 1.8 billion, long-term FHLB advances of 3.0 billion and fair value adjustments of 290 million associated with hedged long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by redemptions or maturities of 2.3 billion of notes and 520 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations since September 30, 2023. Average other short-term borrowings decreased 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased long-term debt which reduced the need for short-term funding during the period. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp s liquidity management.

 BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 
 The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management s accounting practices and businesses change. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp eliminated certain revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking. As a result, the results of operations for the Wealth and Asset Management segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of these revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking. 
 
 The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 
 
 The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets increased since December 31, 2023 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products decreased modestly since December 31, 2023 due to modified assumptions and an inverted yield curve. As a result, net interest income for each segment was negatively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of these updates to FTP charge and credit rates. 
 
 The Bancorp s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 
 
 The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

 Net income was 393 million and 1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 718 million and 2.0 billion for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases for both periods were primarily driven by decreases in net interest income on an FTE basis and increases in provision for credit losses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. 
 
 Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased 339 million and 994 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average balances of and rates paid on interest checking deposits and money market deposits, decreases in FTP credits on deposits and decreases in average balances of commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by increases in yields on average commercial loans. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by a decrease in FTP charges on commercial loans and leases, which was primarily attributable to lower average balances. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by an increase in FTP charges, which was primarily attributable to higher FTP charge rates, partially offset by lower average balances. 
 
 Provision for credit losses increased 76 million and 247 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in the allocated provision for credit losses related to commercial criticized assets as well as increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 39 bps and 34 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 12 bps and 13 bps for the same periods in the prior year.

 Net income was 42 million and 136 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 79 million and 226 million for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases for both periods were primarily driven by decreases in net interest income, partially offset by increases in noninterest income. 
 
 Net interest income decreased 48 million and 132 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in FTP credits on deposits and increases in rates paid on average deposits. 
 
 Noninterest income increased 5 million and 24 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in wealth and asset management revenue, which increased 6 million and 23 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven by increases in personal asset management revenue. 
 
 Average loans and leases decreased 260 million and 314 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average commercial and industrial loans, average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average home equity loans as payoffs exceeded loan production. 
 
 Average deposits decreased 121 million and 668 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by decreases in average interest checking deposits, average demand deposits and average money market deposits as a result of lower average balances per customer account, partially offset by increases in average savings deposits and average certificates of deposit. 

General Corporate and Other 
 General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. 
 
 Net interest income on an FTE basis increased 728 million and 1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in interest income on other short-term investments and increases in FTP charges on loans and leases allocated to the business segments as well as decreases in FTP credits on deposits allocated to the business segments. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in interest expense on long-term debt. The increases in FTP charges allocated to the business segments were driven by increases in market interest rates, primarily across the fixed-rate asset portfolios. The decreases in FTP credits allocated to the business segments were driven by lower assumed liquidity premiums from deposit portfolios. Under the Bancorp s internal reporting methodology, the Bancorp insulates the business segments from interest rate risk associated

 with fixed-rate lending by transferring this risk to General Corporate and Other through the FTP methodology. As a result, the amount of FTP credits on deposits earned by the business segments generally increases or decreases at a faster pace than the amount of allocated FTP charges on loans and leases. 
 
 The provision for credit losses was 6 million and the benefit from credit losses was 165 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to provision for credit losses of 13 million and 201 million for the same periods in the prior year. The benefit from credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by increases in allocations to the business segments. 
 
 Noninterest income decreased 19 million and 22 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in the loss recognized on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included a decrease in equity method investment income, primarily due to a gain on the partial disposition of an equity method investment during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased 79 million and 171 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by increases in compensation and benefits expense, which were primarily attributable to increases in performance-based compensation, base compensation and employee benefits expense. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was also impacted by an increase in other noninterest expense, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments, as well as the incremental expenses associated with the Bancorp s updated estimate of its allocated share of the FDIC s special assessment.

 RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW 
 The Risk Management Overview section included in Item 7 of the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the Bancorp s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Three Lines of Defense structure as well as key areas of risk, which include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk. Item 7 of the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes additional detailed information about the Bancorp s processes related to operational risk management as well as legal and regulatory compliance risk management. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 
 
 The objective of the Bancorp s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, product and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority based on risk and exposure amount, the use of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk ratings and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. Certain loans and leases with probable or observed credit weaknesses receive enhanced monitoring and undergo a periodic review. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp s credit rating categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 
 
 In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk rating systems. The first of these risk rating systems is based on regulatory guidance for credit risk rating systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also separately maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a through-the-cycle rating philosophy for assessing a borrower s creditworthiness. This through-the-cycle ra ting philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen categories for estimating probabilities of default and an additional eleven categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the regulatory risk rating system. 
 
 The Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information about the Bancorp s processes for developing these models, for estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 
 
 For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 
 
 For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those 
 34

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Commercial Portfolio 
 The Bancorp s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 
 
 The Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic factors and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including, but not limited to, the level of inflation, labor and supply chain issues, volatility and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, including debt and default levels. Additionally, despite recent cuts, borrowers are expected to experience lingering effects from higher-for-longer interest rates. The Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to concentrations. 
 
 The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial loans and leases outline the risks and underwriting requirements for businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry and regional expertise to better monitor and manage different industry and geographic segments of the portfolio.

 The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. The Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements.

 Nonaccrual assets with relationships exceeding 1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. Additionally, collateral values are also reviewed at least annually for all criticized assets. 
 
 The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than 1 million, excluding commercial mortgage loans that are individually evaluated for an ACL. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than 1 million.

 The Bancorp views nonowner-occupied commercial real estate as a higher credit risk product compared to some other commercial loan portfolios due to the higher volatility of the industry.

 Net charge-offs on nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans were immaterial for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Consumer Portfolio 
 The Bancorp s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of six categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these six categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, specific geographic concentration risks and additional risk elements. 
 
 The Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a high-rate environment and as rates begin to fall. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer products fall within the Bancorp s risk appetite. These guidelines are monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the prevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp s risk tolerance limits. 
 
 The payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to changes in benchmark interest rates. Previous increases in interest rates have caused minimum payments on these products to increase, raising the potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. Recent rate cuts and potential future decreases in interest rates may lessen these risks moving forward. The impacts of these rate changes will take time to manifest and their significance will be dependent on the size and number of current and future rate cuts. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to changes in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio. 
 
 Residential mortgage portfolio 
 The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to loan characteristics determined to influence credit risk. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 
 
 The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately 483 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted-average origination debt-to-income ratio of 34 and weighted-average origination LTV of 72 . Approximately 45 of these loans are expected to experience an increase in rate upon reset. For those borrowers, rates are expected to increase by an average of approximately 1.8 , resulting in an average increase in monthly payment amount of approximately 23 . 
 
 Certain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80 and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80 LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk. Approximately two-thirds of these loans consist of loans originated through the Bancorp s loan program for doctors.

 Net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans with a greater than 80 LTV at origination and no mortgage insurance were immaterial for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net charge-offs were immaterial for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and there were net recoveries of 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Home equity portfolio 
 The Bancorp s home equity portfolio of 4.1 billion is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 23 of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp s portfolio of 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 home equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 638 million of the balances mature before December 31, 2028. 
 
 The ACL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that is collectively evaluated is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 
 
 The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80 and those loans with an LTV of 80 or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 38, Table 39 and Table 40 . Of the total 4.1 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 
 74 reside within the Bancorp s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky as of September 30, 2024; 
 32 are in senior lien positions and 68 are in junior lien positions at September 30, 2024; 
 75 of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended September 30, 2024; and 
 The portfolio had a weighted-average refreshed FICO score of 748 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD A and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information.

Net recoveries were 1 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Indirect secured consumer portfolio 
 The indirect secured consumer portfolio is comprised of 12.9 billion of automobile loans and 3.0 billion of indirect recreational vehicle, marine, motorcycle and powersport loans as of September 30, 2024. All concentration and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections. 
 
 The following table provides an analysis of indirect secured consumer portfolio loans outstanding disaggregated based upon FICO score at origination as of:

 It is a common industry practice to advance on these types of loans an amount in excess of the collateral value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans. 
 
 The following table provides an analysis of indirect secured consumer portfolio loans outstanding by LTV at origination as of:

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 23 million and 18 million, respectively, of the Bancorp s nonaccrual indirect secured consumer portfolio loans had an LTV greater than 100 at origination. Net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans with an LTV greater than 100 at origination were 10 million and 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 30 million and 27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Credit card portfolio 
 The credit card portfolio consists of predominantly prime accounts with 98 of balances existing within the Bancorp s footprint at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 72 and 71 , respectively, of the outstanding balances were originated through branch-based relationships with the remainder coming from direct mail campaigns and online acquisitions. 
 
 Given the variable nature of the credit card portfolio, interest rate increases impact this product and it is regularly monitored to ensure the portfolio remains within the Bancorp s risk tolerance. Recent rate cuts and potential future decreases in interest rates may lessen these risks moving forward.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 47. For further information on the Bancorp s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Nonperforming assets were 733 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 689 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, 8 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to 1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.62 and 0.59 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 40 of nonaccrual loans and leases as of September 30, 2024 compared to 32 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were 334 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 8 million from December 31, 2023. Portfolio residential mortgage and consumer nonaccrual loans were 352 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 29 million from December 31, 2023. Refer to Table 48 for a rollforward of portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 
 
 OREO and other repossessed property was 39 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bancorp recognized losses of an immaterial amount and 1 million on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Bancorp recognized losses of 7 million and 8 million on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 13 million and 48 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual portfolio loans and leases had been current in accordance with their contractual terms, compared to 13 million and 35 million for the same periods in the prior year. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 
 Net charge-offs were 48 bps and 41 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 45 bps and 32 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Table 50 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 
 
 The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 40 bps and 35 bps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 34 bps and 22 bps during the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of 7 million and 60 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans increased to 62 bps during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 53 bps and 48 bps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on solar energy installation loans of 6 million and 23 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and an increase in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans of 15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments). The Bancorp s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 
 
 The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp s expected credit loss models. These factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 
 
 In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 
 
 For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. 
 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession. 
 
 The Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50 of the time and worse than the projection 50 of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10 probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90 probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90 probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10 probability that it will perform worse. 
 
 September 30, 2024 ACL 
 The ACL as of September 30, 2024 was impacted by several factors when compared to December 31, 2023, including a more favorable macroeconomic forecast and lower period-end loan and lease balances. As of September 30, 2024, the Bancorp s macroeconomic scenarios included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by expected interest rate cuts and geopolitical risks. At September 30, 2024, the Bancorp assigned an 80 probability weighting to the Baseline scenario and 10 to each of the Upside and Downside scenarios.

During the third quarter of 2024, economic growth remained resilient despite restrictive monetary policy. The FOMC continues to seek a soft landing for the economy while balancing the risks of cutting rates too soon with the risks of maintaining a restrictive policy for too long. Seeing positive momentum in inflation trending toward its long-term target of 2 , the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 50 bps in September 2024. The Baseline scenario used in the September 30, 2024 ACL assumed a continued trend of positive inflation data with an expectation that inflation will reach the FRB s long-term target by early 2025, supported by an expectation that the FRB will continue to maintain a reduced pace of quantitative tightening. In response to fiscal tightening and high interest rates, this scenario also assumed that real GDP growth would be below trend in the near term but that the unemployment rate will remain relatively steady. 
 
 The Baseline scenario assumed an average annual real GDP growth rate of 2.6 for 2024, followed by 2.1 in 2025 and 2.0 in 2026. The Baseline scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 4.1 for 2024 and 2025, slightly decreasing to an average of 4.0 in 2026. Lastly, the Baseline scenario assumed additional cuts to the target federal funds rate beyond the third quarter of 2024, with an average federal funds rate of 5.2 in 2024 that decreases to an average of 4.4 and 3.4 in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The Upside scenario assumed that, on an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 2.8 in 2024, 3.4 in 2025 and 2.4 in 2026. The Upside scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 3.9 , 3.2 and 3.3 in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. In the Upside scenario, the forecast for federal funds rate cuts was generally consistent with the Baseline scenario. The Downside scenario included significant worsening of economic conditions, causing the U.S. economy to fall into a recession in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Downside scenario assumed that real GDP declines from the third quarter of 2024 through the second quarter of 2025, with a cumulative decline of 2.6 , modestly recovering to an average annualized GDP growth rate of 1.3 for the fourth quarter of 2025 and for the full year of 2026. The Downside scenario assumed an average unemployment rate of 4.4 in 2024, increasing to an average of 7.9 in 2025 and decreasing to an average of 7.6 in 2026. In the Downside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate included steeper rate cuts than the Baseline scenario, with average target rates of 5.1 in 2024, followed by 3.1 and 1.1 in 2025 and 2026, respectively. 
 
 The Bancorp s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100 probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately 2.0 billion. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted.

 INTEREST RATE AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest-sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons: 
 
 Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times; 
 Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or 
 The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 
 
 In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. 
 
 Management continually reviews the Bancorp s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk. 
 
 The Commercial Banking and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Consumer and Small Business Banking line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk indicators and Board-approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp s risk tolerance. 
 
 The Bancorp s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Corporate Credit Committee (accountable to the ERMC), provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The Bancorp s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities. 
 
 Net Interest Income Sensitivity 
 The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. The NII simulation model does not represent a forecast of the Bancorp s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of market interest rate environments. As a result, actual results will differ from simulated results for multiple reasons, which may include actual balance sheet composition differences, timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected customer behavioral assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bancorp s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons under parallel and non-parallel ramped increases and decreases in interest rates. Policy limits are utilized for scenarios assuming a 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates over 12-month and 24-month horizons. The Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in rates, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve, and employs policy limits and/or key risk indicators to monitor and manage exposures under these types of scenarios. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates. 
 
 In order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance migration or attrition in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp s NII sensitivity modeling assumes additional attrition of approximately 350 million of demand deposit balances over a period of 24 months for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately 350 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months for each 100 bps decrease in short-

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 term market interest rates. The incremental balance attrition and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes. 
 
 Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which the Bancorp s interest-bearing deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorp utilizes dynamic deposit beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels. The dynamic beta models were developed utilizing the Bancorp s performance during prior interest rate cycles. Since the beginning of the current tightening cycle, the Bancorp s actual cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through September 30, 2024 was approximately 55 -60 , as repricing has been similar to what was experienced in prior interest rate cycles. Using the dynamic beta models, the Bancorp s NII sensitivity modeling assumes weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit betas at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 79 for both a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates. In the event of rate cuts, this approach assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 69 and 68 for a 100 bps and 200 bps decrease in rates, respectively. In falling rate scenarios, deposit rate floors are utilized to ensure modeled deposit rates will not become negative. NII simulation modeling assumes no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. Future actual performance will be dependent on market conditions, the level of competition for deposits and the magnitude of continued interest rate increases. The Bancorp provides sensitivity analysis in Tables 54 and 55 for key assumptions related to its deposit modeling, including beta and demand deposit balance performance. 
 
 The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 
 
 The following table shows the Bancorp s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of: 
 TABLE 53: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and ALCO Policy Limits September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit Change in Interest Rates (bps) 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months +200 Ramp over 12 months (3.89) (5.18) (5.00) (6.00) (3.27) (4.73) (4.00) (6.00) +100 Ramp over 12 months (1.90) (2.45) N/A N/A (1.62) (2.25) N/A N/A -100 Ramp over 12 months 1.06 0.57 N/A N/A 0.61 0.27 N/A N/A -200 Ramp over 12 months 1.79 1.08 (5.00) (6.00) 0.91 (0.18) (8.00) (12.00) 
 
 Table 53 presents the change in estimated net interest income for 12 month and 13-24 month horizons for alternative interest rate scenarios relative to the net interest income projection for a static rate scenario for those same time horizons. As previously mentioned, these numbers do not represent a forecast, but are instead risk measures that are monitored to evaluate the consolidated interest rate risk position of the Bancorp. At September 30, 2024, the Bancorp s NII sensitivity in the rising-rate scenarios is negative in years one and two as interest expense is expected to increase more than interest income due to deposit repricing and balance migration estimates given the high interest rate environment. The Bancorp s NII simulation projects an increase in NII in years one and two under the parallel 200 bps ramp decrease in interest rates, driven by an expectation that deposits would reprice faster than earning assets. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to increases in fixed-rate loans and interest-bearing core deposits combined with reduced wholesale funding. 
 
 Tables 54 and 55 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp s estimated NII profile at September 30, 2024 to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity (beta) assumptions.

 Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 
 The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool to govern and manage its interest rate risk exposure. The exposure is governed by a risk framework that uses policy limits for scenarios assuming an instantaneous 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates. The Bancorp routinely analyzes exposures to other interest rate scenarios and employs policy limits and/or key risk indicators to monitor and manage exposures. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and two-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate any assumptions related to continued production or renewal activities used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits. 
 
 The following table shows the Bancorp s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of: 
 TABLE 56: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change in Interest Rates (bps) Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit +200 Shock (4.50) (12.00) (5.92) (12.00) +100 Shock (1.78) N/A (2.39) N/A -100 Shock 0.87 N/A 1.88 N/A -200 Shock (1.55) (12.00) 2.21 (12.00) 
 
 The EVE sensitivity is negative in both a +200 bps rising-rate scenario and in a -200 bps falling-rate scenario at September 30, 2024. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from September 30, 2023 were primarily related to changes in forward interest rate expectations and shortening of the investment portfolio duration in both rising and falling rate scenarios, which was partially offset by an increase in fixed-rate loans and reduced wholesale funding. 
 
 While an instantaneous shift in spot interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the 
 53 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates. 
 
 The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, basis risks relative to the Prime Rate and various SOFR terms, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 
 
 Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 
 An integral component of the Bancorp s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. 
 
 Tables 57 and 58 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index, to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Fifth Third s asset and liability management activities:

 Additionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 options as well. Refer to the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure. 
 
 The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk 
 The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was 1.7 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. For further information on the significant drivers and components of the valuation adjustments on MSRs, refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD A. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp s foreign denominated loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 812 million and 1.0 billion, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management. 
 
 Commodity Risk 
 The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management.

 LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
 The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The Bancorp s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios. 
 
 Liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp (parent company) receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon. 
 
 The Bancorp s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. 
 
 Sources of Funds 
 The Bancorp s primary sources of funds include revenue from noninterest income as well as cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of borrowings. 
 
 Of the 52.0 billion in fair value o f securities in the Bancorp s available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities portfolios at September 30, 2024, 7.6 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional 8.5 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD A. 
 
 Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp s ability to monetize loans and leases through repurchase agreements, outright sales, securitizations or pledging to secured borrowing sources. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bancorp sold or securitized loans and leases totaling 1.4 billion and 3.2 billion, respectively, compared to 3.3 billion and 5.9 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp s average core deposits and average shareholders equity funded 86 and 85 of its average total assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 85 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. 
 
 In June of 2023, the Board of Directors authorized 10.0 billion of debt or other securities for issuance, of which 7.0 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance as of September 30, 2024. The Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. The Bancorp issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes of 1.0 billion in January 2024 and 750 million in September 2024, as further discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s global bank note program had a borrowing capacit y of 25.0 billion , of which 19.4 billion was available for issuance. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately 68.5 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources, including the FRB and the FHLB. 
 
 Current Liquidity Position 
 The Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over 100 billion in current available liquidity. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD A for more information regarding the Bancorp s deposit portfolio characteristics. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources, while supplementing with a variety of secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources across the maturity spectrum, which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. The Bancorp s investment portfolio remains highly concentrated in liquid and readily marketable instruments and is a significant source of secured borrowing capacity. As part of its liquidity management activities, the Bancorp maintains collateral at its secured funding providers to ensure immediate availability of funding. Additionally, the Bancorp executes periodic test trades to assess the operational processes associated with its secured funding sources. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bancorp (parent company) had sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary for 36 months. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp s or Bank s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp s or Bank s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 
 
 The Bancorp s and Bank s credit ratings are summarized in Table 59. The ratings reflect the ratings agency s view on the Bancorp s and Bank s capacity to meet financial commitments. 
 
 As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 Management regularly reviews the Bancorp s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Ratios 
 The Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of well-capitalized for insured depository institutions. 
 TABLE 60: Prescribed Capital Ratios Minimum Well-Capitalized CET1 capital: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.50 N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association

 8.00 10.00 Leverage: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.00 N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association 
 4.00 5.00 
 
 The Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5 . As of September 30, 2024, the Bancorp s stress capital buffer requirement was 2.5 . Effective October 1, 2024, the stress capital buffer increased to 3.2 . The Bancorp s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented. 
 
 The Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. The Bancorp s modified CECL transition amount began phasing out on January 1, 2022, and will be fully phased-out by January 1, 2025. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp s regulatory capital at September 30, 2024 was an increase in capital of approximatel y 124 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp s CET1 capital ratio would be reduced by 7 bps a s of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the Basel III Capital Rules, which would modify its existing risk-based capital framework for large banks and introduce a new framework that implements international capital standards. The proposed rulemaking would adjust capital requirements applicable to banking organizations with total assets of 100 billion or more, including Fifth Third, and would align the calculation of regulatory capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets across large banking organizations. As proposed, the rules would be effective for the Bancorp on July 1, 2025 and phased in over a three-year transition period. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact. 
 
 On August 29, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to require that certain banking organizations with 100 billion or more in consolidated assets, including Fifth Third, comply with certain long-term debt requirements at the holding company and insured depository institution levels. These proposed requirements are intended to increase loss absorbing capacity at insured depository institutions in order to reduce the cost of recapitalization in the event of the closure of a banking organization. As proposed, the rules would be phased in over a three-year period after their effective date. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact, which is dependent on the finalization of the aforementioned proposed capital rule.

 Capital Planning 
 The Bancorp maintains a comprehensive process for managing capital that considers the current and forward-looking macroeconomic and regulatory environments and makes capital distributions that are consistent with FRB requirements. Under the Enhanced Prudential Standards tailoring rules, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The Bancorp is also subject to the FRB s supervisory stress tests every two years. The Bancorp was subject to the 2024 supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB and submitted its Board-approved capital plan, as required, by the April 5, 2024 deadline. 
 
 Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program 
 The Bancorp s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of 0.37 and 0.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.07 and 1.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Pursuant to the Bancorp s Board-approved capital plan, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions. Refer to Note 17 and Note 25 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (Item 3) 
 Information presented in the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference. This information contains certain statements that the Bancorp believes are forward-looking statements. Refer to page 1 for cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements. 

Controls and Procedures (Item 4) 
 The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorp s management, including the Bancorp s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on the foregoing, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorp s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorp s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bancorp files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to the Bancorp s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Bancorp s management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bancorp s internal control over financial reporting. In the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp implemented a new general ledger accounting system. The new general ledger accounting system was implemented in order to standardize processes, improve efficiency and enhance management reporting and analysis, and was subject to thorough testing and review both before and after final implementation. This implementation has not materially affected, and the Bancorp does not expect it to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

 ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which amends the disclosure requirements for reportable segments. The amendments include new requirements to disclose certain significant segment expenses and other items, the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and information about how the reported measures of segment profit or loss are used in assessing segment performance. The amendments also make certain annual disclosure requirements applicable to interim periods and permit the reporting of multiple measures of segment profit or loss if appropriate. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp for the year ending December 31, 2024 and subsequent interim reporting periods beginning in 2025, with early adoption permitted. Consistent with this implementation guidance, the Bancorp will provide the amended disclosures within its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented.

The amendments also discontinue certain other disclosure requirements. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted.

 CREDIT RISK PROFILE 
 Commercial Portfolio Segment 
 For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes: commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leases. 
 
 To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp utilizes the following categories of credit ratings: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. The five categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter. 
 
 Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential or well-defined weaknesses and for which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated at least annually based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter. 
 
 The Bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease or the Bancorp s credit position. 
 
 The Bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans and leases have well-defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. Loans and leases with this rating also are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bancorp will sustain some loss if the deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected. 
 
 The Bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans.

 Residential Mortgage and Consumer Portfolio Segments 
 For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its consumer portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes: home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans. The Bancorp s residential mortgage portfolio segment is also a separate class. 
 
 The Bancorp considers repayment performance as the best indicator of credit quality for residential mortgage and consumer loans, which includes both the delinquency status and performing versus nonperforming status of the loans. The delinquency status of all residential mortgage and consumer loans and the performing versus nonperforming status are presented in the following tables. 
 
 For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information about the Bancorp s process for developing these models and its process for estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period.

 Collateral-Dependent Loans and Leases 
 The Bancorp considers a loan or lease to be collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. When a loan or lease is collateral-dependent, its fair value is generally based on the fair value less cost to sell of the underlying collateral.

 Commercial portfolio segment 
 Commercial loan modifications are individually negotiated and may vary depending on the borrower s financial situation, but the Bancorp most commonly utilizes term extensions for periods of three to . In less common situations and when specifically warranted by the borrower s situation, the Bancorp may also consider offering commercial borrowers interest rate reductions or payment delays, which may be combined with a term extension.

 Residential mortgage portfolio segment 
 The Bancorp has established residential mortgage loan modification programs which define the type of modifications available as well as the eligibility criteria for borrowers. The designs of the Bancorp s modification programs for residential mortgage loans are similar to those utilized by the various GSEs. The most common modification program utilized for residential mortgage loans is a term extension for up to months from the modification date, combined with a change in interest rate to a fixed rate (which may be an increase or decrease from the rate in the original loan). As part of these modifications, the Bancorp may capitalize delinquent amounts due at the time of the modification into the principal balance of the loan when determining its modified payment structure. For loans where the modification results in a new monthly payment amount, borrowers may be required to complete a trial period of three to before the loan is permanently modified. The Bancorp also offers payment delay modifications to qualified borrowers which allow either the delay of

 Consumer portfolio segment 
 The Bancorp s modification programs for consumer loans vary based on type of loan. The most common modification program for home equity is a term extension for up to months combined with a delay in repayment of delinquent amounts due until maturity, which is typically combined with an interest rate reduction. Modification programs for credit card typically involve an interest rate reduction and an increase to the minimum monthly payment in order to repay a larger portion of outstanding balances. Modifications for indirect secured consumer loans, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans are less commonly utilized as part of the Bancorp s loss mitigation activities and programs vary by specific product type.

 In a securitization transaction that occurred in August of 2023, the Bancorp transferred billion in aggregate automobile loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a VIE. This trust then issued approximately billion of asset-backed notes, of which approximately million were retained by the Bancorp. Additionally, as a result of a previous business acquisition, the Bancorp acquired interests in a completed securitization transaction in which solar energy installation loans were transferred to a bankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a VIE. 
 
 In each of these securitization transactions, the primary purposes of the VIEs were to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority, as well as residual interests, and to provide access to liquidity for originated loans. The Bancorp retained residual interests in the VIEs and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. In addition, the Bancorp retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. As a result, the Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and has consolidated these VIEs. The assets of the VIEs are restricted to the settlement of the asset-backed securities and other obligations of the VIEs. The third-party holders of the asset-backed notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp. 
 
 The economic performance of the VIEs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The principal risks to which the VIEs are exposed include credit risk and prepayment risk. The credit and prepayment risks are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, over-collateralization, excess interest on the loans and the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities to other classes.

 CDC investments 
 CDC invests in projects to create affordable housing and revitalize business and residential areas. CDC generally co-invests with other unrelated companies and/or individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity that owns the property under development. The entities are usually formed as limited partnerships and LLCs and CDC typically invests as a limited partner/investor member in the form of equity contributions. The economic performance of the VIEs is driven by the performance of their underlying investment projects as well as the VIEs ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying project or the VIEs ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs. For information regarding the Bancorp s accounting for these investments, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bancorp s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and any additional unfunded commitments for future equity contributions. The Bancorp s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments, including the unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the liabilities related to the unfunded commitments, which are included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are included in the previous tables for all periods presented. Certain CDC investments include undrawn liquidity and lending commitments which are included in the maximum exposure amount but not included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp has no other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that would expose the Bancorp to a loss. In certain arrangements, the general partner/managing member of the VIE has guaranteed a level of projected tax credits to be received by the limited partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the Bancorp s risk. 
 
 The Bancorp utilizes the proportional amortization method to account for its qualifying investments in projects that are related to certain income tax credit programs. Effective with the adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, these tax credit programs include the LIHTC program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC and the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, the Bancorp utilized the proportional amortization method for its LIHTC investments but other tax credit program investments were accounted for under the equity method. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp s CDC investments included billion and billion, respectively, of investments in tax credit programs for which the Bancorp had elected to apply the proportional amortization method. The unfunded commitments related to these investments were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024 are expected to be funded from to .

 (b) The related cash flows are classified as operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily in net change in other assets. 

Private equity investments 
 The Bancorp invests as a limited partner in private equity investment funds which provide the Bancorp an opportunity to obtain higher rates of return on invested capital, while also providing strategic opportunities in certain cases. Each of the limited partnerships has an unrelated third-party general partner responsible for appointing the fund manager. The Bancorp has not been appointed fund manager for any of these private equity investments. The funds finance primarily all of their activities from the partners capital contributions and investment returns. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds because it does not have the obligation to absorb the funds expected losses or the right to receive the funds expected residual returns that could potentially be significant to the funds and lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the funds. The Bancorp, as a limited partner, does not have substantive participating or substantive kick-out rights over the general partner. Therefore, the Bancorp accounts for its investments in these limited partnerships under the equity method of accounting. 
 
 The Bancorp is exposed to losses arising from the negative performance of the underlying investments in the private equity investment funds. As a limited partner, the Bancorp s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are presented in previous tables. Also, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp s unfunded commitment amounts to the private equity funds were million and million, respectively. As part of previous commitments, the Bancorp made capital contributions to private equity investments of million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Loans provided to VIEs 
 The Bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated VIEs sponsored by third parties. These VIEs are generally established to finance certain consumer and small business loans originated by third parties. The entities are primarily funded through the issuance of a loan from the Bancorp or a syndication through which the Bancorp is involved. The sponsor/administrator of the entities is responsible for servicing the underlying assets in the VIEs. Because the sponsor/administrator, not the Bancorp, holds the servicing responsibilities, which include the establishment and employment of default mitigation policies and procedures, the Bancorp does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary. 
 
 The principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit risk related to the underlying assets. The Bancorp s maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and unfunded commitments to the VIEs. The Bancorp s outstanding loans to these VIEs are included in commercial loans in Note 5. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp s unfunded commitments to these entities were billion and billion, respectively. The loans and unfunded commitments to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp s overall analysis of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments, respectively. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these VIEs. 
 
 Lease pool entities 
 The Bancorp is a co-investor with other unrelated leasing companies in LLCs designed for the purpose of purchasing pools of residual interests in leases which have been originated or purchased by the other investing member. For each LLC, the leasing company is the managing member and has full authority over the day-to-day operations of the entity. While the Bancorp holds more than of the equity interests in each LLC, the operating agreements require both members to consent to significant corporate actions, such as liquidating the entity or removing the manager. In addition, the Bancorp has a preference with regards to distributions such that all of the Bancorp s equity contribution for each pool must be distributed, plus a pre-defined rate of return, before the other member may receive distributions. The leasing company is also entitled to the return of its investment plus a pre-defined rate of return before any residual profits are distributed to the members. 
 
 The lease pool entities are primarily subject to risk of losses on the lease residuals purchased. The Bancorp s maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amount of the investments. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it

 The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of the MSR portfolio. This strategy may include the purchase of free-standing derivatives and various available-for-sale debt and trading debt securities. The interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from sale activities associated with these portfolios are expected to economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the MSR portfolio caused by fluctuating OAS, earnings rates and prepayment speeds. The fair value of the servicing asset is based on the present value of expected future cash flows.

 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on these variations in the assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. The Bancorp believes that variations of these levels are reasonably possible; however, there is the potential that adverse changes in key assumptions could be even greater. Also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interests that continue to be held by the Bancorp is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which might magnify or counteract these sensitivities.

 Fair Value Hedges 
 The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert its fixed-rate funding to floating-rate or to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Decisions to enter into these interest rate swaps are made primarily through consideration of the asset/liability mix of the Bancorp, the desired asset/liability sensitivity and interest rate levels. As of September 30, 2024, certain interest rate swaps met the criteria required to qualify for the shortcut method of accounting that permits the assumption of perfect offset. For all designated fair value hedges of interest rate risk as of September 30, 2024 that were not accounted for under the shortcut method of accounting, the Bancorp performed an assessment of hedge effectiveness using regression analysis with changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk recorded in the same income statement line in current period net income.

 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The assets or liabilities may be grouped in circumstances where they share the same risk exposure that the Bancorp desires to hedge. The Bancorp may also enter into interest rate caps and floors to limit cash flow variability of floating-rate assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, all hedges designated as cash flow hedges were assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. The entire change in the fair value of the interest rate swap included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI and reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Bancorp is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is months. 
 
 Reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related to commercial loans are recorded within interest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, million and million of net deferred losses, net of tax, on cash flow hedges were recorded in AOCI in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, million in net unrealized losses, net of tax, recorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 
 During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were gains or losses reclassified from AOCI into earnings associated with the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional period of time as defined by U.S. GAAP.

 Free-Standing Derivative Instruments Risk Management and Other Business Purposes 
 As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBA securities and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio. Principal-only swaps hedge the spread between mortgage

 Free-Standing Derivative Instruments Customer Accommodation 
 The majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the Bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments include foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, commodity contracts to hedge such items as natural gas and various other derivative contracts. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. The Bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary dealers. Revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative contracts are recorded as a component of commercial banking revenue or other noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 The Bancorp enters into risk participation agreements, under which the Bancorp assumes credit exposure relating to certain underlying interest rate derivative contracts. The Bancorp typically only enters into these risk participation agreements in instances in which the Bancorp has participated in the loan that the underlying interest rate derivative contract was designed to hedge. The Bancorp will make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract.

As of September 30, 2024, the risk participation agreements had a weighted-average remaining life of years. 
 
 The Bancorp s maximum exposure in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest rate derivative contracts in an asset position at the time of default. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying customers in the risk participation agreements through the same risk grading system currently utilized for establishing loss reserves in its loan and lease portfolio.

 Offsetting Derivative Financial Instruments 
 The Bancorp s derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA Master Agreements and similar arrangements, which include provisions governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the parties. When the Bancorp has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, the setoff provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the non-defaulting party the right to reduce its liability to the defaulting party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received as well as eligible offsetting transactions with that counterparty, irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office. The Bancorp s policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for setoff are in place. However, for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat variation margin payments as settlements, the fair value of the respective derivative contracts is reported net of the variation margin payments. 
 
 Collateral amounts included in the tables below consist primarily of cash and highly rated government-backed securities and do not include variation margin payments for derivative contracts with legal rights of setoff for both periods shown.

 Commitments to extend credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. The Bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty for the amount of the contract. Fixed-rate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the Bancorp s exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp had a reserve for unfunded commitments, including letters of credit, totaling million and million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit using the same standard regulatory risk rating systems utilized for its loan and lease portfolio.

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bancorp had outstanding letters of credit that were supporting certain securities issued as VRDNs. The Bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by marketing the VRDNs to investors. The VRDNs pay interest to holders at a rate of interest that fluctuates based upon market demand. The VRDNs generally have long-term maturity dates, but can be tendered by the holder for purchase at par value upon proper advance notice. When the VRDNs are tendered, a remarketing agent generally finds another investor to purchase the VRDNs to keep the securities outstanding in the market. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total VRDNs, of which FTS was the remarketing agent for all, were million and million, respectively. As remarketing agent, FTS is responsible for actively remarketing VRDNs to other investors when they have been tendered. If another investor is not identified, FTS may choose to purchase the VRDNs into inventory at its discretion while it continues to remarket them. If FTS purchases the VRDNs into inventory, it can subsequently tender back the VRDNs to the issuer s trustee with proper advance notice. The Bancorp issued letters of credit, as a credit enhancement, to million and million of the VRDNs remarketed by FTS at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These letters of credit are included in the total letters of credit balance provided in the previous tables.

 million and million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The Bancorp uses the best information available when estimating its mortgage representation and warranty reserve; however, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts reserved as of September 30, 2024 are reasonably possible. The Bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to mortgage representation and warranty provisions in an amount up to approximately million in excess of amounts reserved. This estimate was derived by modifying the key assumptions to reflect management s judgment regarding reasonably possible adverse changes to those assumptions. The actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the recorded mortgage representation and warranty reserve or this estimate of reasonably possible losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those previously discussed. 
 
 During both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp paid an amount in the form of make-whole payments and repurchased million and million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp paid an amount in the form of make-whole payments and repurchased million and million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. Total repurchase demand requests during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. Total repurchase demand requests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. Total outstanding repurchase demand inventory was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Margin accounts 
 FTS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, guarantees the collection of all margin account balances held by its brokerage clearing agent for the benefit of its customers. FTS is responsible for payment to its brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. The margin account balances held by the brokerage clearing agent were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the event of customer default, FTS has rights to the underlying collateral provided. Given the existence of the underlying collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, the Bancorp does not maintain a loss reserve related to the margin accounts.

 The Bancorp had certain fully and unconditionally guaranteed long-term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust entities of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The Bancorp, as a member bank of Visa prior to Visa s reorganization and IPO (the IPO of its Class A common shares (the Class A Shares in 2008, had certain indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with its membership agreements. In accordance with Visa s bylaws prior to the IPO, the Bancorp could have been required to indemnify Visa for the Bancorp s proportional share of losses based on the pre-IPO membership interests. As part of its reorganization and IPO, the Bancorp s indemnification obligation was modified to include only certain known or anticipated litigation (the Covered Litigation as of the date of

 million of Visa s Class B common shares (the Class B Shares based on the Bancorp s membership percentage in Visa prior to the IPO. The Class B Shares were not transferable (other than to another member bank) until the later of the third anniversary of the IPO closing or the date on which the Covered Litigation has been resolved; therefore, the Bancorp s Class B Shares were classified in other assets and accounted for at their carryover basis of . Visa deposited billion of the proceeds from the IPO into a litigation escrow account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation. Since then, when Visa s litigation committee determined that the escrow account was insufficient, Visa issued additional Class A Shares and deposited the proceeds from the sale of the Class A Shares into the litigation escrow account. When Visa funded the litigation escrow account, the Class B Shares were subjected to dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of Class B Shares into Class A Shares. On January 23, 2024, Visa announced shareholder approval of changes to its articles of incorporation that would release certain transfer restrictions on portions of Class B Shares. The program will allow holders of Class B Shares to liquidate some of their shares subject to assurances that other Visa stockholders will retain existing protection from exposure to the Covered Litigation. 
 
 In 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and entered into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares. The swap terminates on the later of the third anniversary of Visa s IPO or the date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. Refer to Note 23 for additional information on the valuation of the swap. The counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the Class B Shares will be impacted by dilutive adjustments to the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares caused by any Covered Litigation losses in excess of the litigation escrow account. If actual judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation significantly exceed current expectations, then additional funding by Visa of the litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of the Class B Shares could result in a scenario where the Bancorp s ultimate exposure associated with the Covered Litigation (the Visa Litigation Exposure exceeds the value of the Class B Shares owned by the swap counterparty (the Class B Value ). In the event the Bancorp concludes that it is probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure exceeds the Class B Value, the Bancorp would record a litigation reserve liability and a corresponding amount of other noninterest expense for the amount of the excess. Any such litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the fair value derivative liability associated with the total return swap. 
 
 As of the date of the Bancorp s sale of the Visa Class B Shares and through September 30, 2024, the Bancorp has concluded that it is not probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure will exceed the Class B Value. Based on this determination, upon the sale of Class B Shares, the Bancorp reversed its net Visa litigation reserve liability and recognized a free-standing derivative liability associated with the total return swap.

 of the merchants who requested exclusion from the class filed separate federal lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard and certain other defendants alleging similar antitrust violations. These individual federal lawsuits were transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. While the Bancorp is only named as a defendant in one of the individual federal lawsuits, it may have obligations pursuant to indemnification arrangements and/or the judgment or loss sharing agreements noted above. On September 17, 2018, the defendants in the consolidated class action signed a second settlement agreement (the Amended Settlement Agreement resolving the claims seeking monetary damages by the proposed plaintiffs class (the Plaintiff Damages Class and superseding the original settlement agreement entered into in October 2012. The Amended Settlement Agreement included, among other terms, a release from participating class members for liability for claims that accrue no later than five years after the Amended Settlement Agreement becomes final. The Amended Settlement Agreement provided for a total payment by all defendants of approximately billion, composed of approximately billion held in escrow plus an additional million in new funds. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, million of the additional million has been returned to the defendants due to the level of opt-outs from the class. The Bancorp s allocated share of the settlement is within existing reserves, including funds maintained in escrow. On December 13, 2019, the Court entered an order granting final approval for the settlement, and on March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed that order. The settlement does not resolve the claims of the separate proposed plaintiffs class seeking injunctive relief or the claims of merchants who have opted out of the proposed class settlement and are pursuing, or may in the future decide to pursue, private lawsuits. On September 27, 2021, the Court entered an order certifying a class of merchants pursuing claims for injunctive relief. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking preliminary approval of a settlement that would resolve class claims for injunctive relief. On June 13, 2024, the Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs motion for preliminary approval of the injunctive relief settlement, and on June 25, 2024, the Court issued an order denying the request for preliminary approval of the settlement. The ultimate outcome in this matter, including the timing of resolution, remains uncertain. Refer to Note 18 for further information. 
 
 Klopfenstein v. Fifth Third Bank 
 On August 3, 2012, William Klopfenstein and Adam McKinney filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third Bank in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (Klopfenstein et al. v. Fifth Third Bank), alleging that the APR that Fifth Third disclosed on its Early Access program was misleading. Early Access is a deposit-advance program offered to eligible customers with checking accounts. The plaintiffs sought to represent a nationwide class of customers who used the Early Access program and repaid their cash advances within 30 days. On October 31, 2012, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. In 2013, similar putative class action lawsuits were filed against Fifth Third Bank in federal courts throughout the country (Lori and Danielle Laskaris v. Fifth Third Bank, Janet Fyock v. Fifth Third Bank, Jesse McQuillen v. Fifth Third Bank, and Brian Harrison v. Fifth Third Bank). Those lawsuits were transferred to the Southern District of Ohio and consolidated with the original lawsuit as In re: Fifth Third Early Access Cash Advance Litigation (Case No. 1:12-CV-851). On behalf of a putative class, the plaintiffs sought unspecified monetary and statutory damages, injunctive relief, punitive damages, attorneys fees, and pre- and post-judgment interest. On March 30, 2015, the court dismissed all claims alleged in the consolidated lawsuit except a claim under the TILA. On May 28, 2019, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of plaintiffs breach of contract claim and remanded for further proceedings. The plaintiffs claimed damages for the alleged breach of contract claim exceed million, plus prejudgment interest. On March 26, 2021, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. On March 29, 2023, the trial court issued an order granting summary judgement on plaintiffs TILA claim, with statutory damages capped at million plus costs and attorney fees. Plaintiffs claim for breach of contract proceeded to trial beginning on April 17, 2023. On April 27, 2023, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Bank, finding a breach of contract, but that the voluntary payment doctrine is a complete defense to the breach of contract claim. On September 30, 2024, the trial court issued a decision denying post-trial motions related to the jury verdict. 
 
 Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection v. Fifth Third Bank, National Association 
 On March 9, 2020, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entitled CFPB v. Fifth Third Bank, National Association, Case No. 1:20-CV-1683, alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, TILA, and Truth in Savings Act related to Fifth Third s alleged opening of unspecified numbers of allegedly unauthorized credit card, savings, checking, online banking and early access accounts from 2010 through 2016. The parties agreed to the entry of a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order on July 9, 2024 to resolve this matter, pursuant to which Fifth Third, without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the suit except as specified in the order, agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of million, agreed to maintain existing policies around

 million civil monetary penalty related to those issues, maintain existing policy changes related to its auto servicing practices, agreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its compliance with the order and provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers within a redress period beginning July 21, 2011 and ending December 31, 2020. 
 
 Howards v. Fifth Third Bank 
 On March 8, 2018, Plaintiff Troy Howards filed a putative class action against Fifth Third Bank in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. 1:18-CV-869, S.D. OH 2018), alleging that Fifth Third improperly charged certain fees related to insufficient funds, customer overdrafts, and out-of-network ATM use. Venue was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiff filed claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, for violation of the California Unfair Competition Law (Ca. Bus. Prof. Code sec. 17200, et seq.), and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Cal. Civ. Code sec. 1750 et seq.). Plaintiff seeks to represent putative nationwide classes and California classes of consumers allegedly charged improper repeated insufficient funds fees, improper overdraft fees, and fees for out-of-network ATM use from the beginning of the applicable statute of limitations to present. Plaintiff seeks damages of restitution and disgorgement in the amount of the allegedly unlawfully charged fees, damages proved at trial together with interest as allowed by applicable law. Fifth Third filed a motion to dismiss all claims. On February 6, 2023, the trial court issued an order dismissing the Plaintiff s breach of contract claim with respect to out-of-network ATM fees and dismissing the two claims for violations of California consumer protection statutes. The Court denied Fifth Third s motion to dismiss as it relates to the claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for certain customer overdrafts and insufficient funds fees. The case is in discovery, and no trial date has been set. 
 
 Other litigation 
 The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other material litigation at this time. However, there are other litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business, which include, or may include, claims related to product features, pricing and other lending practices. For example, Fifth Third Bank, National Association is currently responding to lawsuits regarding bankruptcies and practices of residential solar installers as well as lending practices of credit providers to this market, which includes Dividend Solar Finance, LLC, which the Bank acquired in May 2022. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these contingent matters, management believes that the resulting liability, if any, from these other actions would not have a material effect upon the Bancorp s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to the Bancorp s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Record-Keeping Investigations 
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is conducting an investigation into the Bancorp s registered swap dealer concerning compliance with certain record-keeping requirements for business-related electronic communications. 
 
 Governmental Investigations and Proceedings 
 The Bancorp and/or its affiliates are or may become involved in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, including but not limited to the FRB, OCC, CFPB, SEC, FINRA, U.S. Department of Justice, etc., as well as state and other governmental authorities and self-regulatory bodies regarding their respective businesses. For example, Fifth Third Bank, National Association is currently cooperating with investigations related to several civil investigative demands by a number of state attorneys general regarding the residential solar installation industry and lending practices of credit providers to this market, which includes Dividend Solar Finance, LLC, which the Bank acquired in May 2022. Among these are investigations related to multiple lenders by a coalition of state attorneys general relating to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing of one such installer, Power Home Solar, LLC, dba Pink Energy. Dividend Solar Finance, LLC financed installations of Power Home Solar, LLC customers in of the states represented by the coalition. Additional matters will likely arise from time to time. Any of these matters may result in material adverse consequences or reputational harm to the Bancorp, its affiliates and/or their respective directors, officers and other personnel, including adverse judgments, findings, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of the Bancorp s SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. Investigations by regulatory authorities may from time to time result in civil or criminal referrals to law enforcement. Additionally, in some cases, regulatory authorities may take supervisory actions that are considered to be confidential supervisory information which may not be publicly disclosed. 
 
 Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals 
 The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are 
 112 

Table of Contents

 million in excess of amounts accrued, with it also being reasonably possible that no losses will be incurred in these matters. The estimates included in this amount are based on the Bancorp s analysis of currently available information, and as new information is obtained the Bancorp may change its estimates. 
 
 For these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of possible losses in excess of the established accrual that cannot be estimated. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage and established accruals, the Bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the Bancorp and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Bancorp s consolidated financial position. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Bancorp s results of operations for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and the operating results for the applicable period.

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 While it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the Bancorp s uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease during the next twelve months, the Bancorp believes it is unlikely that its unrecognized tax benefits will change by a material amount during the next twelve months.

 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Available-for-sale debt and other securities, trading debt securities and equity securities 
 Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models which primarily utilize quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 2 securities may include federal agencies securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities and equity securities. These securities are generally valued using a market approach based on observable prices of securities with similar characteristics.

 million. Immediate decreases in current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in increases in the fair value of the IRLCs of approximately million and million, respectively. Immediate increases in current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in decreases in the fair value of the IRLCs of approximately million and million, respectively. An immediate 10 or 20 change in loan closing rates, either adverse or favorable, would have a material impact on the fair value of IRLCs as of September 30, 2024. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution, as changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. 
 
 Short positions 
 Where quoted prices are available in an active market, short positions are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models which primarily utilize quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and therefore are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 2 securities include asset-backed and other debt securities.

 Commercial loans held for sale 
 The Bancorp estimated the fair value of certain commercial loans held for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These valuations were primarily based on applying unobservable inputs such as an estimated market discount to the unpaid principal balance of the loans (Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy). 
 
 Portfolio loans and leases 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain collateral-dependent portfolio loans and leases. When a loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the loan is generally based on the fair value less cost to sell of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and therefore these loans were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the amortized cost basis of the loan or lease exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the collateral, then an ALLL is recognized, or a charge-off once the remaining amount is considered uncollectible. 
 
 OREO 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties and branch-related real estate no longer intended to be used for banking purposes classified as OREO and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. These nonrecurring losses were primarily due to declines in real estate values of the properties upon the transfer, or subsequent to the transfer, to OREO. The fair value amounts are generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. The previous tables reflect the fair value measurements of the properties before deducting the estimated costs to sell. 
 
 Bank premises and equipment 
 The Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. These properties were written down to their lower of cost or market values. At least annually thereafter, the Bancorp will review these properties for market fluctuations. The fair value amounts were generally based on appraisals of the

 million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and did recognize gains during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from observable price changes. The carrying value of the Bancorp s private equity investments still held as of September 30, 2024 includes a cumulative million of positive adjustments as a result of observable price changes since January 1, 2018. Because these adjustments are based on observable transactions in inactive markets, they are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 For private equity investments which are accounted for using the measurement alternative to fair value, the Bancorp qualitatively evaluates each investment quarterly to determine if impairment may exist. If necessary, the Bancorp then measures impairment by estimating the value of its investment and comparing that to the investment s carrying value, whether or not the Bancorp considers the impairment to be temporary. These valuations are typically developed using a DCF method, but other methods may be used if more appropriate for the circumstances. These valuations are based on unobservable inputs and therefore are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Bancorp did recognize impairment charges on its private equity investments. The Bancorp recognized million of impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The carrying value of the Bancorp s private equity investments still held as of September 30, 2024 includes a cumulative million of impairment charges recognized since adoption of the measurement alternative to fair value on January 1, 2018. 
 
 Fair Value Option 
 The Bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under U.S. GAAP. Electing to measure residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. Management s intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and maintained in the Bancorp s loan portfolio. In such cases, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value. 
 
 Fair value changes recognized in earnings for residential mortgage loans held at September 30, 2024 and 2023 for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the changes in fair value of the underlying IRLCs, included gains of million and losses of million, respectively. These changes are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 Valuation adjustments related to instrument-specific credit risk for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively impacted the fair value of those loans by an amount at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest on loans measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned using the effective interest method and is reported as interest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

 business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Results of the Bancorp s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management s accounting practices and businesses change. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Bancorp eliminated certain revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking. As a result, the results of operations for the Wealth and Asset Management segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of these revenue sharing agreements between Wealth and Asset Management and Consumer and Small Business Banking. The impact of the elimination of these revenue sharing agreements for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 resulted in a decrease in wealth and asset management revenue and an offsetting decrease in other noninterest expense within the Wealth and Asset Management segment of million, million and million, respectively. 
 
 The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 
 
 The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. 
 
 The Bancorp s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 
 
 The following is a description of each of the Bancorp s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases. 
 
 Commercial Banking offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and government and professional customers. In addition to the traditional lending and depository offerings, Commercial Banking products and services include global cash management, foreign exchange and international trade finance, derivatives and capital markets services, asset-based lending, real estate finance, public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance. 
 
 Consumer and Small Business Banking provides a full range of deposit and loan products to individuals and small businesses through a network of full-service banking centers and relationships with indirect and correspondent loan originators in addition to providing products designed to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services. Consumer and Small Business Banking includes the Bancorp s residential mortgage, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards, automobile and other indirect lending, solar energy installation and other consumer lending activities. Residential mortgage activities include the origination, retention and servicing of residential mortgage loans, sales and securitizations of those loans and all associated hedging activities. Indirect lending activities include extending loans to consumers through automobile dealers, motorcycle dealers, powersport dealers, recreational vehicle dealers and marine dealers. Solar energy installation loans and certain other consumer loans are originated through a network of contractors and installers.

If any obligation is unascertained, Y may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained. Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise). 
 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Bank agrees not to set off or net amounts due from Counterparty with respect to any Transaction against amounts due from Bank to Counterparty with respect to contracts or instruments that are not Equity Contracts. Equity Contract means any transaction or instrument that does not convey to Bank rights, or the ability to assert claims, that are senior to the rights and claims of common stockholders in the event of Counterparty s bankruptcy. 
 13. Delivery of Shares . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Bank may, by prior notice to Counterparty, satisfy its obligation to deliver any Shares or other securities on any date due (an Original Delivery Date by making separate deliveries of Shares or such securities, as the case may be, at more than one time on or prior to such Original Delivery Date, so long as the aggregate number of Shares and other securities so delivered on or prior to such Original Delivery Date is equal to the number required to be delivered on such Original Delivery Date. 
 14. Early Termination . In the event that an Early Termination Date (whether as a result of an Event of Default or a Termination Event) occurs or is designated with respect to any Transaction (except as a result of a Merger Event in which the consideration or proceeds to be paid to holders of Shares consists solely of cash), if either party would owe any amount to the other party pursuant to Section 6(d)(ii) of the Agreement (any such amount, a Payment Amount ), then, in lieu of any payment of such Payment Amount, Counterparty may, no later than the Early Termination Date or the date on which such Transaction is terminated, elect to deliver or for Bank to deliver, as the case may be, to the other party a number of Shares (or, in the case of a Merger Event, a number of units, each comprising the number or amount of the securities or property that a hypothetical holder of one Share would receive in such Merger Event (each such unit, an Alternative Delivery Unit and, the securities or property comprising such unit, Alternative Delivery Property )) with a value equal to the Payment Amount, as determined by the Calculation Agent (and the parties agree that, in making such determination of value, the Calculation Agent may take into account a number of factors, including the market price of the Shares or Alternative Delivery Property on the date of early termination and, if such delivery is made by Bank, the prices at which Bank purchases Shares or Alternative Delivery Property to fulfill its delivery obligations under this Section 14) provided that in determining the composition of any Alternative Delivery Unit, if the relevant Merger Event involves a choice of consideration to be received by holders, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the maximum possible amount of cash and provided further that Counterparty may make such election only if Counterparty represents and warrants to Bank in writing on the date it notifies Bank of such election that, as of such date, Counterparty is not aware of any material non-public information concerning the Shares and is making such election in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with the federal securities laws. If such delivery is made by Counterparty, paragraphs 2 through 7 of Annex A shall apply as if such delivery were a settlement of the Transaction to which Net Share Settlement applied, the Cash Settlement Payment Date were the Early Termination Date and the Forward Cash Settlement Amount were zero (0) minus the Payment Amount owed by Counterparty. 
 15. Calculations and Payment Date upon Early Termination . The parties acknowledge and agree that in calculating Close-out Amount pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement Bank may (but need not) determine losses without reference to actual losses incurred but based on expected losses assuming a commercially reasonable (including without limitation with regard to reasonable legal and regulatory guidelines) risk bid were used to determine loss to avoid awaiting the delay associated with closing out any hedge or related trading position in a commercially reasonable manner prior to or sooner following the designation of an Early Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6(d)(ii) of the Agreement, all amounts calculated as being due in respect of an Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) of the Agreement will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective provided that if Counterparty elects to receive Shares or Alternative Delivery Property in accordance with Section 14, such Shares or Alternative Delivery Property shall be delivered on a date selected by Bank as promptly as practicable. 

16. CARES Act. Counterparty represents and warrants that it and any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries has not applied, and throughout the term of the Transaction shall not apply, for a loan, loan guarantee, direct loan (as that term is defined in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act )) or other investment, or to receive any financial assistance or relief (howsoever defined) under any program or facility that (a) is established under applicable law (whether in existence as of the Trade Date or subsequently enacted, adopted or amended), including without limitation the CARES Act and the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, and (b) requires under applicable law (or any regulation, guidance, interpretation or other pronouncement thereunder), as a condition of such loan, loan guarantee, direct loan (as that term is defined in the CARES Act), investment, financial assistance or relief, that Counterparty agree, attest, certify or warrant that it has not, as of the date specified in such condition, repurchased, or will not repurchase, any equity security of Counterparty, and that it has not, as of the date specified in such condition, made a capital distribution or will not make a capital distribution. Counterparty further represents and warrants that the Prepayment Amount is not being paid, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with funds received under or pursuant to any program or facility, including the U.S. Small Business Administration s Paycheck Protection Program , that (a) is established under applicable law (whether in existence as of the Trade Date for such Transaction or subsequently enacted, adopted or amended), including without limitation the CARES Act and the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, and (b) requires under such applicable law (or any regulation, guidance, interpretation or other pronouncement of a governmental authority with jurisdiction for such program or facility) that such funds be used for specified or enumerated purposes that do not include the purchase of Shares (either by specific reference to the Transaction or by general reference to transactions with the attributes thereof in all relevant respects). 
 17. Method of Delivery . Whenever delivery of funds or other assets is required hereunder by or to Counterparty, such delivery shall be effected through DBSI. In addition, all notices, demands and communications of any kind relating to any Transaction between Deutsche and Counterparty shall be transmitted exclusively through DBSI. 
 18. Automatic Termination Provisions . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 of the Agreement, if a Termination Price is specified in any Supplemental Confirmation, then an Additional Termination Event with Counterparty as the sole Affected Party and the Transaction to which such Supplemental Confirmation relates as the Affected Transaction will automatically occur without any notice or action by Bank or Counterparty if the price of the Shares on the Exchange at any time falls below such Termination Price, and the Exchange Business Day that the price of the Shares on the Exchange at any time falls below the Termination Price will be the Early Termination Date for purposes of the Agreement. 
 
 19. Delivery of Cash . For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Master Confirmation shall be interpreted as requiring Counterparty to deliver cash in respect of the settlement of the Transactions contemplated by this Master Confirmation following payment by Counterparty of the relevant Prepayment Amount, except in circumstances where the required cash settlement thereof is permitted for classification of the contract as equity by ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , as in effect on the relevant Trade Date (including, without limitation, where Counterparty so elects to deliver cash or fails timely to elect to deliver Shares or Alternative Delivery Property in respect of the settlement of such Transactions).

 Director Pay Program 

Bancorp Director Pay Program 
 
 Fifth Third Bank s Director Pay Program is reviewed each year. Our compensation philosophy is to position director compensation competitively relative to our peer group to attract and retain highly competent candidates with significant leadership capabilities for Board service. We benchmark the compensation package for Directors to that of our peers those banks with whom we compete for talent and customers. 
 
 Director pay at Fifth Third Bank is comprised of two primary components 
 Annual Cash Retainer Additional annual cash retainer is paid to committee chairpersons and members of certain committees. 
 Long-Term Incentive Compensation (LTI) Equity-based awards consisting of restricted stock units (RSU). 
 Directors have the choice of deferring all components of pay. Cash retainers can be deferred under the Fifth Third Bancorp Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, and LTI can be deferred under the Fifth Third Bancorp Incentive Compensation Plan. 

Bancorp Director Pay Program Highlights 
 Vesting There is no set vesting schedule for RSUs granted for Board service. Rather, RSUs are paid out in shares when service as a Director ends. 
 RSU Deferral Feature The choice is available to defer receipt of shares under the award beyond when board service ends. The deferral feature is described in more detail below. 
 Dividend Deferral Reinvested per policy, unless grandfathered under previous policy. 
 Grant Date The grant date coincides with the date of the Annual Meeting. 
 Restricted Stock Units Awards will be made in Restricted Stock Units. 
 Share Ownership Directors are required to maintain a share ownership level equal to at least six times (6x) their annual cash retainer amount, not including fees payable for committee service. Directors have 5 years from their election date to meet this requirement. 

This document constitutes part of a prospectus covering securities that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Director Pay Program 

As a Fifth Third Bancorp Director, there are several ways to defer receipt of compensation for services as a Director. These are outlined below. 
 Director Cash Retainer Deferral 
 Fifth Third has made available to its Directors the option to defer 50 percent or more of the cash compensation payable for services as a Director and or as a member of a Committee of the Board of Directors. Percentage elections are made on an annual basis during open enrollment, which typically occurs during November or December. The percentage elected will be credited to a Deferred Compensation account, which will be paid in cash on a future date as specified on the election form. For more information, please see the Summary of the Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors . 
 Director LTI Deferral 
 The vesting on any LTI award will be deferred until service as a Board of Director ends. This means that upon leave from the Board any accumulated LTI awards will be distributed in one lump sum. An election to change the timing of this distribution can be made by deferring receipt until a later date. 
 The deferral election period typically occurs during November or December for the following years RSU grant. During the deferral election period one or a combination of the following schedules can be chosen for any grants that might be given in the future 
 Lump Sum Distribution The choice can be made to defer receipt of grants from one to 10 years after the date Board service ends. Units will be distributed in one lump sum on August 1 of the year chosen following service end date. Example Board leave date is February 1, 2026 , and five years after term date is elected as the deferral. Units will distribute in one lump sum on August 1, 2031. 
 Installment Distribution Receipt of accumulated units can be spread over one to up to 10 years. Distributions from each outstanding grant will occur in equal annual installments starting on August 1 following the service end date. All distributions are to be completed by the 10th anniversary of the leave date. Example Service end date is February 1, 2026, and an annual installment over five years is elected The distribution will be made in substantially equal, annual installments to last five years. The first distribution would be made August 1, 2026. 

The initial election to instruct Fifth Third on how distributions are to be received is made once. 
 The installment schedule chosen will apply to any grants received in the future. However, elections to defer individual grants must be made each year. Directors can expect an election form in the mail each Fall, asking that an election be made to defer or not defer the upcoming year s RSU grant. 
 Dividend Equivalents 
 As described above, dividend equivalents will be reinvested for all new Directors. Legacy Directors previously have two choices for how dividend equivalents will be paid in cash or reinvested. If the cash election is made, dividend equivalents will be received by direct deposit or a check mailed to the address of record. If the reinvestment election is made or is required in the case of a new director, dividend equivalent amounts will be converted to additional Restricted Stock Units. These additional units will be attached to outstanding awards and will be distributed at the same time the shares from the Restricted Stock Units are distributed. 
 The Director LTI deferral election materials will include election information for dividend equivalents. 
 Designation of a Beneficiary 
 To designate a beneficiary, log onto the Fidelity brokerage account, go to update account features and click on profile. Follow the steps provided online to designate beneficiaries for the account. If a decision is made not to designate a beneficiary, the estate shall be deemed to be the beneficiary.

Questions & Answers 
 
 What if I want to change my payout election 
 After the initial election is made, if it s determined a change is needed to that election, a one-time change will be allowed by submitting a new election form. Election changes to outstanding grants are allowed provided they are made at least one year before the scheduled payout and must defer payout for at least five additional years (but cannot defer payment beyond 10 years after the leave date). 
 If I choose installments, how will my distribution be calculated 
 For the purposes of calculating an installment schedule, distributions will be made in substantially equal, annual installments to last from 1 -10 years accordingly. The last distribution can be made no later than the tenth calendar year following the calendar year of service end date.
