Summary
Risk Factors 

Our

as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, which

 protection and/or liquidate;

Risks
 that affect our ability to successfully market our products to key demographics;

Significant
 product returns from customers, excess inventory and our ability to manage our inventory; 

Our
 ability to compete against competitors which may have greater resources; 

Our
 significant reliance on related party transactions and loans; 

The
 fact that our Chief Executive Officer, Ezra Dabah, has majority voting control over the Company; 

If
 the use of cookie tracking technologies is further restricted, regulated, or blocked, or if changes in technology
 cause cookies to become less reliable or acceptable as a means of tracking consumer behavior, the amount or accuracy of internet
 user information would decrease, which could harm our business and operating results; 

Our
 ability to comply with loan and funding covenants, conditions to obtaining additional funding under securities purchase agreements,
 dilution caused by the conversion of convertible notes, our ability to pay amounts due under convertible notes and comply with covenants
 associated therewith; 

Our
 ability to prevent credit card and payment fraud; 

The
 risk of unauthorized access to confidential information; 

System
 interruptions that impair client access to our website or other performance failures in our technology infrastructure could damage
 our business; 

Our
 ability to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets, claims from third parties that we have violated their intellectual
 property or trade secrets and potential lawsuits in connection therewith; 

2 

Our
 ability to comply with changing regulations and laws, penalties associated with any non-compliance (inadvertent or otherwise), the
 effect of new laws or regulations, our ability to comply with such new laws or regulations, and changes in tax rates; 

Our
 reliance on our current management, who are not party to any employment agreements with us; 

The
 outcome of future lawsuits, litigation, regulatory matters or claims; 

Certain
 terms and provisions of our governing documents which may prevent a change of control, and which provide for indemnification of officers
 and directors, limit the liability of officers or directors, and provide for the Board of Directors ability to issue blank
 check preferred stock; 

Dilution
 which will occur upon the closing of the Merger (defined below); costs, fees and expenses, and the timing associated with, the Merger
 Agreement; the Company s ability to meet conditions to closing the Merger Agreement; the ability of the parties to the Merger
 Agreement (defined below) to terminate such agreement, and potential break-fees due in connection therewith; uncertainties while
 the Merger Agreement is pending; and risks related to the ability of the combined company to recognize the benefits of the Merger; 

The
 fact that we have a limited operating history; the effect of future acquisitions on our operations and expenses; 

Our
 significant indebtedness; 

The
 fact that we may require additional capital to support business, and this capital might not be available or may be available only
 by diluting existing stockholders; 

The
 anticipated volatile nature of the trading prices of our common stock and dilution which may be caused by future sales of securities;
 and 

Our
 ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, including our current non-compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing
rules, and the fact that Nasdaq has determined to delist our common stock, which determination we have appealed to a hearings panel.

of Nina Footwear. The Board of Directors of both companies
have approved the all-stock transaction. The combined company will operate as Nina Holdings Corp., with the transactions anticipated
to close during the first quarter of 2025. As a result of the transaction, the stockholders of Nina Footwear will receive 80 of the
outstanding stock of the combined company. 

Revenue
from online website sales, which includes sales from our and third-party websites (Amazon and Walmart), are recognized when control of
the promised goods are transferred to the Company s customers, in an amount that depicts the consideration the Company expects
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Control is transferred at the time of shipment. Upon shipment, the total amount of the
order is recognized as revenue. Payment for online website sales is due upon the time of order. 

The
provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. 

Estimates
of discretionary authorized returns for sales other than subscription sales, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates,
(2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims, and (3) estimated
returns, discounts and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period
are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were
significantly greater or lower than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenue would be recorded in the period in which
such determination was made. 

Shipping
and handling costs associated with outbound freight fulfillment before control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted
for as shipping and handling cost in the condensed interim statements of operations. 

Taxes
assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction and are collected
by the Company from a customer are excluded from revenue and cost of goods sold in the condensed interim statements of operations.

The
Company applies U.S. GAAP accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than
not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures
the tax benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming the tax position
is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of relevant information. 

The
Company has no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023. The Company s federal, state and local
income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2019 are closed and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits,
proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings. 

The
Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with tax matters, if any, as part of operating expenses and includes accrued interest
and penalties with accrued expenses in the condensed interim balance sheets.

as of September 28, 2024. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to achieve profitability, and the Company may incur significant losses
for the foreseeable future. 

To
support the Company s existing operations, the Company must have sufficient capital to continue to make investments and fund operations. 

On
May 31, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with EF Hutton YA Fund, LP (the
 Investor ). Pursuant to the SPA, the Company agreed to sell the Investor three tranches of convertible debentures,
in an aggregate principal amount of (the Convertible Debentures ). 

On
May 31, 2024, the first tranche of Convertible Debentures with a face amount of (the Initial Debenture was sold to the Investor. The Company also agreed to sell an additional in Convertible Debentures (the Second Closing 
and the Second Convertible Debenture upon the filing of a Definitive Proxy Statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC or the Commission to seek stockholder approval for, among other things,
the pending merger with Nina Footwear Corp. (the Definitive Proxy Statement ), and (the Third
Closing and the Third Convertible Debenture in Convertible Debentures on or about the date a registration
statement to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures becomes effective (the Initial
Registration Statement and the approval of the Company s stockholders is received for the issuance of shares of common
stock upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures as required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

The Company
agreed to sell all Convertible Debentures with a original issue discount and, as a result thereof, it received in gross
proceeds, prior to expenses, upon the sale of the Initial Debenture. The Second and Third Closings are subject to certain closing conditions,
including those discussed above, as described in greater detail in the SPA. See also Note 9: Short-term debt . 

As discussed in Note 9, the Company was not able to
meet the filing deadline for the Initial Registration Statement. As a result, an event of default has occurred under the Convertible Debenture;
however, the Investor has not yet provided us notice of the acceleration of amounts due thereunder. At any time, until we cure such default,
the Investor can provide us notice that the full unpaid principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Debenture, together with interest
and other amounts owing in respect thereof, is immediately due and payable in cash. We do not currently have sufficient cash on hand to
pay amounts due under the Convertible Debenture and is such amount was immediately due and payable we would need to raise additional funding
through the sale of debt or equity, which funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and/or sell assets, and may be forced
to seek bankruptcy protection, which could cause the securities of the Company to become worthless. 

The
Company s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon obtaining new financing for its ongoing operations. To manage operating
cash flows in the near term, the Company has ceased purchasing new inventory and if available, may enter into cash advance or other financing
arrangements. Future financing options available to the Company include funding expected to be provided by the SPA, equity financings,
debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions to fund existing
operations and execute management s growth strategy, and borrowings from related parties, including Ezra Dabah, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer, and Nina Footwear. Equity financing may include sales of common stock. Such financing may not be available on
terms favorable to the Company or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the Company s
stockholders and may cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there
is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continued
operations, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations, and
it could ultimately be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate. These matters, when considered in the aggregate, raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is defined as within one
year after the date that the condensed interim financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed interim financial statements
do not contain any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company also believes that the Merger, assuming it is successfully closed, will strengthen the Company s balance sheet and provide
additional cash from operations to support the combined company s operations moving forward. 

Total liability in fair value hierarchy 
 - 
 - 

Level
3 financial liabilities consist of the derivative liability for which there is no current market for the securities such that the determination
of fair value requires judgment or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. 

The
Company s derivative liability represents embedded share-settled redemption features bifurcated from the underlying convertible
note and is carried at fair value. The changes in fair value of the derivative liability are recorded as change in other expense/(income)
in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

The
fair value of the share-settled redemption derivative liability was based on management s estimate of the expected future cash
flows required to settle the liabilities.

See
Note 9 below for a description of short-term debt from affiliated entities under common control and from stockholders. 

.

In
September, October and November 2021, the Company borrowed from a stockholder. The notes are unsecured, noninterest-bearing
and the principal was due on January 15, 2022, or was due at the rate of of such note amount, upon a sale of the Company (including
a change of or more of the voting shares). On December 27, 2021, the Company paid of the outstanding loan amounts. On March
31, 2022, and effective on January 15, 2022, the parties amended the notes to be payable on demand. On July 2, 2022, the Company paid
 of the outstanding loan amounts. 

On
September 18, 2023, the Company entered into a Debt Conversion agreement with Ezra Dabah, the holder of the September, October and
November 2021 notes, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company. The Company and Mr. Dabah agreed to convert an
aggregate of 
of principal owed by the Company under the September 2021 note and part of the October 2021 note, into an aggregate of 
shares of restricted common stock of the Company. The conversion price was equal to 
per share, which was above the closing consolidated bid price of the Company s common stock on the date the Debt Conversion
Agreement was entered into. Pursuant to the Debt Conversion Agreement, which included customary representations and warranties of
the parties, the stockholder agreed that the shares of common stock issuable in connection therewith were paid in full and complete
satisfaction of the amounts owed under the converted notes. 

During
March 2024, Mr. Dabah loaned the Company , of which was repaid in April 2024. The amount loaned was not evidenced by a
promissory note, does not accrue interest and is payable on demand. 

On
February 7, 2024, the Company entered into a cash advance agreement with a financial institution and was advanced cash totaling 
to be used for operating expenses. In accordance with the agreement, the issuance was made at a discount and the Company agreed to repay
 per annum. 

On
April 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Promissory Note (the Nina Footwear Note ), with Nina Footwear,
with whom the Company is party to a March 29, 2024, Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement ),
with Nina Footwear and Kidpik Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ),
as previously disclosed. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into Nina Footwear, with Nina Footwear surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ).
The closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the preparation and mailing of a proxy statement by the
Company, and the receipt of required stockholder approvals from the Company and Nina Footwear stockholders, and is expected to close
in the first quarter of 2025. 

The
Nina Footwear Note in the principal amount of does not accrue interest but does accrue interest of per annum upon the occurrence
of an event of default; with weekly payments of principal and interest in the amount of , due each week beginning with the week
ended April 26, 2024, until the earlier of the maturity date of such note, the payment in full thereof, or the closing of the Merger,
where the Nina Footwear Note is expected to be forgiven by Nina Footwear. The Nina Footwear Note is due upon the earlier of October 31,
2024, and upon acceleration by Nina Footwear pursuant to the terms thereof. As of September 28, 2024, Kidpik has repaid of the
note, which is a total of 6 payments. 

The
Nina Footwear Note includes customary events of default and allows Nina Footwear the right to accelerate the amount due under the
note upon the occurrence of such event of default, subject to certain cure rights. The Company is in default and anticipates working
with Nina Footwear to extend the due date of the note through the closing date of the Merger following the date of this
filing. 

During
May thru September 2024, Nina Footwear loaned the Company .
The loan was not evidenced by a promissory note, does not accrue interest and is payable on demand. 

On
May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a financial institution and was advanced cash totaling 
to be used for operating expenses. In accordance with the agreement, the Company agreed to repay ,
plus interest, in monthly payments of .
The loan has a 12-month term from the effective date, and bears an interest rate of 
per annum. As of September 28, 2024, Kidpik has made all contractual payments of ,
which includes a down payment on the loan which is . 

On
May 31, 2024, the Company entered into the SPA with the Investor. Pursuant to the SPA, we agreed to sell the Investor three tranches
of convertible debentures, in an aggregate principal amount of . On May 31, 2024, the first tranche of Convertible Debentures
with a face amount of was sold to the Investor. We also agreed to sell an additional in Convertible Debentures upon
the filing of a Definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC to seek stockholder approval for, among other things, the Merger, and 
in Convertible Debentures on or about the date the Initial Registration Statement becomes effective and the approval of its stockholders,
as required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market for issuances of shares in excess of the Exchange Cap (as defined below),
has been obtained (the date of such stockholder approval, the Shareholder Approval ). 

The
Company agreed to sell all Convertible Debentures with a original issue discount and, as a result thereof, we received in
gross proceeds, prior to expenses, upon the sale of the Initial Debenture. The Second and Third Closings are subject to certain closing
conditions, including those discussed above, as described in greater detail in the SPA. The Initial Debenture bears, and the subsequent
Convertible Debentures issued under the SPA will bear interest at an annual rate of per annum and will mature on May 31, 2025, as
may be extended at the option of the Investor. The interest rate is subject to increase to upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any event of default thereunder as discussed in greater detail below. 

If,
any time after the issuance date, an amortization event occurs, then the Company is required to make monthly payments to the Investor,
beginning on the 10th trading day after the date the amortization event occurs and continuing on the same day of each successive calendar
month in an amount equal to the sum of (i) of principal (in the aggregate among all Convertible Debentures), or the outstanding
principal, if less than such amount (the Amortization Principal Amount ), plus (ii) a prepayment premium of of
any amounts paid (the Payment Premium ), and (iii) accrued and unpaid interest as of each payment date. The obligation
of the Company to make monthly prepayments related to an amortization event ceases upon the Company curing the amortization event as
described in the Convertible Debentures. 

The Company was not able to meet the filing
deadline for the registration statement to register the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the initial Convertible Debenture
and as a result an event of default has occurred under the Convertible Debenture; however,
the Investor has not yet provided us notice of the acceleration of amounts due thereunder. At any time, until we cure such default,
the Investor can provide us notice that the full unpaid principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Debenture, together with
interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, is immediately due and payable in cash. 

The
Convertible Debenture can be converted into common stock at the option of the noteholder. The conversion is subject to the limitations
of the SPA and can be executed at any time or times after the issuance date. The noteholder is entitled to convert any portion of the
outstanding and unpaid principal and accrued interest at the Conversion Price (defined as lower of per share of or of the
lowest daily volume-weighted average price. The price cannot be lower than the Cap Price (defined as per share). The conversion
imposes certain limitations as follows: 

1. 
 Beneficial
 Ownership the noteholder will not convert any portion of the Convertible Debenture to the extent that after such conversion,
 the noteholder would beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated
 thereunder) in excess of . 

2. 
 Principal
 Market Limitation - the Company will not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the SPA if the issuance of such
 shares would exceed the aggregate number of shares of common stock that the Company may issue upon conversion of this Convertible
 Debenture and any other notes in compliance with the Company s obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal
 Market (Nasdaq Stock Market). The number of shares which may be issued without violating such rules and regulations is .
 This limitation can be waived if (A)the Company obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the
 Principal Market for issuances of shares of common stock or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that
 such approval is not required. 

The
Company concluded that the above settlement feature of Convertible Debenture was determined to not be clearly and closely associated
with the risk of the debt host instrument and has therefore been bifurcated and separately accounted for as derivative financial instruments.
The Company remeasured the fair market value of the derivative liability at each balance sheet date and recognize any change in other
expense/(income), net in the consolidated statements of operations. 

The
Company determined the measurement of its derivative liability to be a Level 3 fair value measurement based on management s estimate
of the expected future cash flows required to settle the liabilities. The Company determined the fair value of the derivative liability
related to the Convertible Debenture to be approximately 
 as of September 28, 2024. The fair value of the
derivative liability is presented together with the convertible notes in the condensed interim balance sheet.

did not reduce the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the number
of shares of our common stock available for issuance relative to the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split
did not alter the par value of our common stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of our common stock.

and (B) shares of common stock; provided, however, that the Board may act prior to April 1st of a given year to provide that
the increase for such year will be a lesser number of shares of common stock, also known as an evergreen provision.
Notwithstanding the above, no more than incentive stock options may be granted pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Plan. The
number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2021 Plan increased automatically on April, 1, 2022, by shares,

stock as of December 30, 2023, and as a result a total of shares are currently available for awards under the 2021 Plan, not
including awards previously granted, of which shares remain available for future awards, when including awards previously granted. 

On
November 10, 2021, prior to the pricing of the Company s initial public offering (the IPO ), the Company granted
(a) options to purchase an aggregate of shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share, to certain employees
and consultants of the Company in consideration for services rendered and to be rendered through May 2024; (b) restricted stock
units, to certain executive officers; and (c) restricted stock units RSU to a board of director member.
Such options and restricted stock units vested (i) 1/3 on May 15, 2022; (ii) 1/3 on May 15, 2023; and (iii) 1/3 on May 15, 2024. The
options each have a term of . On May 15, 2022, restricted stock units were vested of which common stock shares
were issued and were forfeited and cancelled to settle tax liability on the vested shares. On May 15, 2023, restricted stock
units were vested of which common stock shares were issued and were forfeited and cancelled to settle tax liability on the
vested shares. On July 21, 2023, restricted stock units were vested of which shares were issued and were forfeited and
cancelled to settle tax liability on the vested shares, in connection with a separation agreement entered into with the Company s
former Chief Financial Officer. On May 15, 2024, restricted stock units were vested of which shares were issued and were forfeited
and cancelled to settle tax liability on the vested shares. 

In
determining the fair value of the stock-based awards, we used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below.
Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment. Expected Term The expected term represents
the period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (generally calculated
as the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). Expected Volatility The expected volatility
was estimated based on the average volatility for publicly-traded companies that we considered comparable, over a period equal to the
expected term of the stock option grants. Risk-Free Interest Rate The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
zero coupon notes in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option. Expected Dividend
 We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock; therefore, we
use an expected dividend yield of zero.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the condensed interim
financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements
and the notes to those financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, which were included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report ). The following
discussion contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future results of the Company that are based on current
expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs and assumptions
of the management of the Company. See also Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information , above. Words
such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, 
 intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, 
variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results
may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to
such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in other reports we file with
the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as otherwise
provided by law. 

The
following discussion is based upon our financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the
collection of receivables, the shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory,
among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions,
we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets
and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales
returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, assumptions used
in the valuation of stock-based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Overview 

We
began operations in 2016 as a subscription-based e-commerce company on the proposition of making shopping easy, convenient, and accessible
for parents by delivering fashionable and customized kids outfits in a box. Kidpik provides kids clothing subscription boxes for
boys and girls (sizes 12M-16) that include mix- -match, coordinated outfits that are personalized based on each member s style
preferences. We focus on providing entire outfits from head-to-toe (including shoes) by designing our products in-house from concept
to box. 

5 

Staying
ahead in an emerging industry requires constant innovation in product and services. After launching our girls subscription boxes
for sizes 4-14 in 2016, we expanded into boys clothing, added larger sizes for boys and girls (up to 16 for apparel and 6 youth
for shoes), in the Spring of 2022, we added toddler sizes down to 2T 3T for apparel and 7 8 toddler shoes. During the second
quarter of 2022, we introduced sizes 12 months and 18 months apparel to our offerings. We have expanded our distribution by selling our
branded products on third-party websites. 

As
of the date of the filing of this Report, we provide e-commerce services throughout the 48 contiguous U.S. states and Army Post Offices
(APOs) and Fleet Post Offices (FPOs).

Time ). The shares of the Company s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market NASDAQ on a post-split basis on March 7, 2024, with new CUSIP number: 49382L207. No change was made to the trading symbol for the Company s
shares of common stock, PIK , in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. 

At
the Effective Time, every five (5) shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into one (1) share of issued and outstanding
common stock, and the total outstanding shares of common stock were reduced from approximately 9.5 million to approximately 1.9 million,
without giving effect to any rounding up of fractional shares. Because the Certificate of Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized
shares of our common stock, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the number of shares of our common stock available
for issuance relative to the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split did not alter the par value of our common
stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of our common stock. 

No
fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive
fractional shares instead were entitled to have their fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. 

In
addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our stock options and other equity awards (including shares
reserved for issuance under the Company s equity compensation plan) were proportionately adjusted by the applicable administrator,
using the 1-for-5 ratio, and rounded up to the nearest whole share, to be effective at the Effective Time, pursuant to the terms of the
Company s equity plans. In addition, the exercise price for each outstanding stock option was increased in inverse proportion to
the 1-for-5 split ratio such that upon an exercise, the aggregate exercise price payable by the optionee to the Company for the shares
subject to the option will remain approximately the same as the aggregate exercise price prior to the Reverse Stock Split, subject to
the terms of such securities.

The
Reverse Stock Split has been retroactively reflected throughout this Report. 

Merger
Agreement 

On
March 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with Nina Footwear Corp., a Delaware corporation Nina Footwear ), a brand specializing in women s special occasion shoes, bridal shoes, bags and kids shoes,
and Kidpik Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ). Upon
the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Nina Footwear, with Nina Footwear surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ). 

At
the effective time of the Merger, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the Merger are expected to own approximately 20 
of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock immediately after the Merger and the stockholders of Nina Footwear immediately
prior to the Merger will own approximately 80 of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock immediately after the Merger. 

Mr.
Dabah and his children own approximately 79.3 of Nina Footwear, and Mr. Dabah and his extended family own 100 of Nina Footwear, and
Moshe Dabah (Mr. Dabah s son), is the Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer of the Company, and
the Secretary of Nina Footwear. There are also a number of related party transactions between Nina Footwear and the Company. Mr. Dabah
and his family will continue to control approximately 76.8 of the combined company s voting shares following the closing of the
Merger (the Closing ). 

Following
the Closing of the Merger, the Company s executive officers and directors will remain the same as immediately prior to the Merger. 

The
closing of the Merger is subject to certain mutual closing conditions. The Company s obligation to consummate the Merger is also
subject to (i) Nina Footwear acknowledging that all of the debt owed by the Company to Nina Footwear (approximately 2.9 million currently
and which amount may increase until the closing of the Merger) is extinguished as consideration of entering into the Merger; (ii) the
waiver or termination of certain change of control and related triggering events held by certain stockholders of Nina Footwear which
if not waived may have required approximately 2.55 million to be paid to such stockholders of Nina Footwear at Closing; and (iii) holders
of no more than 10 of the shares of Nina Footwear capital stock exercising their statutory appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. 

On
July 22, 2024, the Company, Nina Footwear and Merger Sub entered into a First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
(the First Amendment ), pursuant to which each of the parties agreed to extend the required closing date of the Merger
from September 30, 2024, to December 31, 2024. 

We currently anticipate that the closing of the Merger will occur in the
first quarter of 2025, and expect to enter into a further amendment to the Merger Agreement to amend the required closing date of the
Merger to March 31, 2025 following the date of this Report. 

Warehouse
Move From California to Texas 

In
March 2024, we moved our warehouse from California to Texas. As a result of the change in warehouse location, all of our California employees
terminated their employment with us, and we were forced to pay severance payments and hire and train new employees in Texas. As a result,
we were unable to ship products or process returns for the second half of March and the majority of April. The move in warehouse location
from California to Texas was costly, used management resources, and significantly affected sales for March and April 2024, which were
paused while merchandise was shipped from California to Texas and the Texas warehouse was brought online. Furthermore, we may have lost,
and/or may lose in the future, customers who were not satisfied with the long shipping and return terms associated with the move. It
will cost us additional money to continue to train new employees, and our new employees may not be as productive as older employees,
which may increase expenses and decrease margins. If we are unable to adequately staff our new warehouse and any future warehouse(s)
or if the cost of such staffing is higher than historical or projected costs, our margins may be negatively affected. In addition, warehousing
comes with potential risks, such as workplace safety issues and employment claims for the failure or alleged failure to comply with labor
laws or laws respecting union organizing activities. Any such issues may result in delays in shipping times or packing quality, and our
reputation and operating results may be harmed. 

Our
revenues and margins were significantly negatively affected by the move in our warehouse from California to Texas in March and April
2024.

Key
Performance Indicators 

Key performance indicators that
we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and
make strategic decisions include gross margin, shipped items, and average shipment keep rate, each described in greater detail below. 

We also use the following metrics
to assess the progress of our business, make decisions on where to allocate capital, time and technology investments and assess the near-term
and longer-term performance of our business. 

Adjusted
EBITDA 

In
addition to our results calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S.
GAAP ), and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in the
table below and elsewhere in this Report, Adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net loss before
other expense, net, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude the effects of equity-based compensation
expense and loss on derivative. We have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial
measure. 

We
have included Adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our
operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular,
the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period
basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of equity-based compensation, excludes an item that we do not consider to be indicative
of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board. 

Adjusted
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results
as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future,
 and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital requirements; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect certain non-routine items that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and 

Other
 companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative
 measure. 

Because
of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow
metrics, net loss and our other U.S. GAAP results. 

Our
financial results include certain items that we consider non-routine and not reflective of the underlying trends in our core business
operations. 

A
reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

define shipped items as the total number of items shipped in a given period to our customers through our active subscription, online
web sales and third-party website sales.

We
believe the decreases in shipped items for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the 13 and 39 weeks ended
September 30, 2023, as shown in the table above, were driven by a decrease in subscription boxes sales as a result of the Company
stopping marketing expenditures to convert customers into subscribers and a lower starting customer base in comparison to 2023.
Shipped items also decreased due to a reduction in online and third-party website sales. Also contributing for the 39 week period
ended September 28, 2024, is the move of our warehouse to Texas from California, which resulted in the Company shipping a minimal
amount of merchandise during the months of March and April 2024.

The
average shipment keep rate is calculated as the total number of items kept by our customers divided by total number of shipped items
in a given period. Part of the decrease for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024 from the same period in the prior year is due to the
proportionally higher online sales for the same period last year compared to the current year, which traditionally has lower return rates
versus subscription box sales. For the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, keep rate was
relatively flat, which is the result of lower box sales compared to online sales which have a lower return rate. 

Factors
Affecting Our Future Performance 

We
believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present opportunities for us, but also pose risks and
challenges, including those referenced in the section titled Risk Factors. 

Overall
Economic Trends 

The
overall economic environment and related changes in consumer behavior have a significant impact on our business. In general, positive
conditions in the broader economy promote customer spending on our sites, while economic weakness, which generally results in a reduction
of customer spending, may have a more pronounced negative effect on spending on our sites. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer
spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include employment rates, high inflation, business conditions, changes in the
housing market, the availability of credit, and increases in fuel costs, energy costs, raw material costs, and supply chain challenges.
We are continuing to navigate the uncertainties presented by the current macroeconomic environment and remain focused on selling our
inventory and improving our overall customer experience. 

Retention
of Existing Subscribers 

Our
ability to retain subscribers is also a key factor in our ability to sustain revenues and generate revenue growth. Most of our current
subscribers purchase products through subscription-based plans, where subscribers are sent products and billed on a recurring basis.
The recurring nature of this revenue provides us with a certain amount of predictability for future revenue. If customer behavior changes,
or we are not unable to satisfy members with the boxes we ship them and customer retention decreases in the future, then future revenue
will be negatively impacted. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Note
that our classification of the various items making up cost of goods sold, shipping and handling, payroll and related costs, equity-based
compensation and general and administrative costs may vary from other companies in our industry, and as such, may not be comparable to
a competitor s. 

9 

Revenue 

We
generate revenue in two categories: 1) the sale of items in our subscription boxes, and 2) the sale of one-time purchases via shop.kidpik.com,
and third-party websites. We refer to these revenue classifications as Subscription boxes and one-time
purchases , respectively. Net revenue is revenue less promotional discounts, actual customer credits and refunds as well as
customer credits and refunds expected to be issued, and sales tax. When we use the term revenue in this Report, we are referring to net
revenue, unless otherwise stated. Customers who decide to return some or all of the merchandise they receive in each Kidpik box may return
such items within 10 days of receipt of the box. Customers are charged for subscription merchandise which is not returned, or which is
accepted and are charged for general merchandise (non-subscription) when they purchase such merchandise; however, they are able to receive
a refund on returned merchandise. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold consists of the costs of manufacturing merchandise and the expenses of shipping and importing (duty payments) such merchandise
to our warehouse for distribution, and inventory write-offs, offset by the recoverable cost of merchandise estimated to be returned. 

Shipping
and Handling 

Shipping
and handling include the costs of shipping merchandise to our customers, and back to us, as well as the cost of fulfillment and return
processing, materials used for packing. 

Payroll
and Related Expenses 

Payroll
and related expenses represent employee salaries, taxes, benefits, share-based compensation, and fees to our payroll provider. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of marketing, professional fees, third-party seller fees, rent, bad debt expense and credit
card fees, among others. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses consist of depreciation expenses for leasehold improvements and equipment. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our cash advance loans, and amortization of debt discount and outstanding
notes payable. 

Other
Expense (Income) 

Other
expense (income) consists primarily of changes in fair value of derivatives associated with our convertible debt re-evaluation. 

Provision
for Income Taxes 

Our
provision for income taxes consists of an estimate of federal and state income taxes based on enacted federal and state tax rates, as
adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, and changes in the valuation allowance of our net federal and state
deferred tax assets. The Company has a net operating loss of approximately 40 million which is one of the reasons that Nina Footwear
entered into the proposed merger transaction discussed above under Recent Events , Merger Agreement .

Revenue 

Our
revenue for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, decreased by 69.2 to 1,042,648, compared to 3,389,183 for the 13 weeks ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 2,346,535 from the prior period. Subscription box revenue decreased 1,669,918 due to a reduction in new subscribers,
and the elimination of marketing expenditures to convert customers into subscribers along with a lower starting number of subscribers
at the beginning of the period in comparison to last year. Third-party websites sales decreased by 443,235, and online website
sales decreased by 233,382, which are due to the Company s decision not to purchase new merchandise, reduce marketing expenditures and
focus on selling its existing inventory. The revenue breakdown by sales channel for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, and September
30, 2023, is summarized in the table below:

subscribers, due to the elimination of marketing expenditures to convert customers into subscribers and a lower starting number of subscribers
at the beginning of the period in comparison to last year. Third-party websites sales decreased by 1,014,745, and online website sales
decreased by 515,033, which are due to the Company s decision not to purchase new merchandise, reduce marketing expenditures and

The

approximately 107,000 for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, due to the Company s elimination of marketing expenditures to
convert customers to subscribers and the Company s decision not to buy new merchandise. The average shipment keep rate decreased
to 67.7 in the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 82.6 in the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023, as discussed above. 

The

approximately 437,000 for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, which was the result in decreased revenues as well as the move of our
warehouse facility from California to Texas (resulting in downtime for the warehouse). The average shipment keep rate remained relatively
flat at 74.5 for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 74.9 in the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023.

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Our
cost of goods sold decreased by 75.2 to 327,306 for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 1,317,684 for the 13 weeks
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 990,378. 

Our
cost of goods sold decreased by 67.9 to 1,382,424 for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 4,309,473 for the 39 weeks
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2,927,049. 

The
decrease in cost of goods sold for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same period in fiscal 2023, was primarily
attributable to the decrease in our revenue due to the lower sales. The Company recorded a write-down of inventory in the fourth quarter
of 2023 of approximately 2.9 million, thus reducing the cost basis of future sales. 

Gross
Profit and Gross Profit as a Percentage of Revenue 

Our
gross profit was 715,342 for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to gross profit of 2,071,499 for the 13 weeks ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same period in fiscal 2023, was primarily
attributable to the decrease in our revenue due to the lower sales driven by the elimination of marketing expenditures to convert customers
to subscribers, lower base of subscribers at the beginning of the period and the Company s decision not to buy new merchandise,
offset by the decrease in cost of goods sold for the reasons discussed above. 

Gross
profit as a percentage of revenue was 68.6 for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 61.1 for the 13 weeks ended September
30, 2023. Without the reduction of cost basis due to the write-down recorded in the fourth quarter, gross margin would be 54.3 for the
13 weeks ended September 28, 2024. 

Our
gross profit was 3,027,852 for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to gross profit of 6,558,107 for the 39 weeks ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was
primarily attributable to the decrease in our revenue, due to the lower subscription box sales driven by the elimination of marketing
expenditures to convert customers to subscribers, lower base of subscribers at the beginning of the year and the Company s decision
not to buy new merchandise. 

Gross
profit as a percentage of revenue was 68.7 for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 60.3 for the 39 weeks ended September
30, 2023. Without the reduction of cost basis due to the write-down recorded in the fourth quarter, gross margin would be 55.6 for the
39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, as a result of higher markdowns to sell off inventory.

Our
operating expenses include general and administrative expenses, salaries and benefits, shipping and handling, and depreciation and amortization,
as shown in the tables above. Our operating expenses for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, decreased by 2,440,062 or 61.4 to 1,535,271,
compared to 3,975,333 for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly a result of (i) a 1,220,001 decrease in general
and administrative expenses, mainly due to a decrease in marketing expenses due to the elimination of spending for the conversion of
customers to subscribers, reduction in third-party seller fees, credit card fees and bad debt expense which are all directly related
to reductions in sales, as well as professional fees and franchise taxes, (ii) a decrease in payroll and related costs of 637,050, due
to lower headcount related to cost reductions and a decrease in non-cash, equity-based compensation, and (iii) a 582,040 decrease in
shipping and handling, which is the direct result of a decrease in sales.

operating expenses for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023, are summarized in the table below:

compared to 12,392,073 for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly a result of (i) a 2,754,621 decrease in
general and administrative expenses, mainly due to a decrease in marketing expenses due to the elimination of spending for the conversion
of customers to subscribers, third-party seller fees which are directly related to sales, offset by an increase in professional fees,
occupancy and costs related to moving, staging and startup personal training expenses due the move of the California warehouse to Texas,
(ii) a decrease in payroll and related costs of 1,431,261, due to a lower headcount related to cost reductions and a decrease in non-cash,
equity-based compensation , and (iii) a 1,327,923 decrease in shipping and handling, which is the direct result of a decrease in sales.

from re-evaluation of convertible debt, offset by an increase in interest expense of 26,163 from financing costs and amortization of
discount related to convertible debt.

As
of September 28, 2024, the Company had total current liabilities of 7,009,066, consisting mainly of accounts payable of 1,737,249,
accounts payable to related party of 2,236,315, accrued expenses of 273,490, operating lease liability of 420,331, and short-term
debt and related party loans of 2,341,682 (discussed below). 

As

deficit of 55,399,032. 

From
inception through November 10, 2021, we mainly relied on equity and loans from Ezra Dabah, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman,
and his family (which loans have all, other than 850,000, been converted into equity as of September 28, 2024), notes payable including from
Nina Footwear Corp., which Mr. Dabah and his children own approximately 79.3 of, and Mr. Dabah and his extended family own 100 of,
and Moshe Dabah (Mr. Dabah s son), is the Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer of the Company,
and the Secretary of Nina Footwear , a related party, and a line of credit (repaid as of January 1, 2022), and cash
advance agreements , as well as revenue generated through our operations, to support our operations since inception. We have primarily
used our available cash to pay operating expenses (salaries and other expenses), and for merchandise inventory costs, shipping costs
and marketing expenditures. We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. Following the closing of our initial public
offering IPO in November 2021, we have relied on the funds raised in the IPO, as well as revenue generated through
our operations, and funds loaned to us by Nina Footwear and Mr. Dabah, to support our operations. 

On
April 16, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that
its stockholders equity as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 30, 2023 (the Form
10-K ), did not meet the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders equity of at least
 2,500,000 (the Equity Rule ). In the Company s Form 10-K, the Company reported stockholders equity
of 1,036,834, which is below the minimum stockholders equity required for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).
Additionally, as of the date of this Report, the Company does not have stockholders equity greater than 2.5 million and does
meet the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules. 

15 

Nasdaq gave the Company until
May 31, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance, which plan was timely submitted. The plan discussed our expectation to regain
compliance with the Equity Rule upon the closing of the Merger. At the time of the filing of the plan of compliance, the Company also
advised Nasdaq that it was the Company s expectation to regain compliance with the Equity Rule by October 14, 2024 (180 days after
the date from the original deficiency notification, which is the maximum amount of time the Staff can provide, in its discretion, for
an issuer to regain compliance with the Equity Rule). 

Due to unforeseen delays in completing
the required Nina Footwear financial statements and pro forma information, we were unfortunately delayed in filing the required proxy
statement necessary to seek stockholder approval for the issuance of common stock in connection with the Merger, and therefore have been
delayed in completing the Merger. 

As a result, on October 2, 2024,
the Company received a delist determination letter from the Listing Qualifications department (the Staff of The
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq advising the Company that as a result of our failure to file the proxy statement
as of such date, and because Nasdaq has determined that it would not be possible for the Merger to close before October 14, 2024, the
Staff has determined that the Company did not provide a definitive plan evidencing its ability to achieve compliance with the continued
listing requirements and to deny the Company s request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

The Company subsequently submitted
a hearing request to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), which request stayed any delisting action by the Staff
at least until the hearing process concludes and any extension granted by the Panel expires. 

At the Panel hearing, the Company
intends to present a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement, which is expected to be based
around the closing of the planned Merger. In the interim, the Company s common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the
symbol PIK at least pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. 

There can be no assurance that
the Company s plan will be accepted by the Panel or that, if it is, the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable
Nasdaq listing requirements. If the Company s common stock is delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company s
common stock or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting
could also impair the Company s ability to raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements or securities
of the Company. 

The Company remains committed
to completing the Merger and has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger to date. However, there can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to timely file a definitive proxy statement, and/or that the Company will be able to complete
the transactions necessary to regain compliance with the Equity Rule, including the Merger.

Net
cash used in operating activities increased to 1,617,473 for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 461,162 for the 39
weeks ended September 30, 2023. The change in our cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in the changes
in operating assets and liabilities of 2,596,890, and a decrease in non-cash adjustments of 506,303, partially offset by a
decrease in net loss of 1,946,883. 

To
further elaborate on the changes noted above, there was a significant decrease in revenues because the Company is not marketing
subscription services and/or acquiring/maintaining customers and because the Company had a lower customer base at the start of the
year. We also decided not to purchase any inventory and sell through our current quantities, thus limiting selection available to
our customers. The Company also experienced business disruption of sales and additional expenses associated with the move of our
warehouse from California to Texas in April and May of 2024. 

We
had no net cash used in investing activities for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 77,299 of net cash used in investing
activities for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023, which was solely due to the purchase of leasehold improvements and equipment. 

We
had 1,426,163 of net cash provided by financing activities for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, which was related to net
proceeds from cash advances from a financial institution, convertible debt, and related party loans, compared to net cash used in
financing activities of 6,447 related to cash used to settle equity awards for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023.

Convertible
Debentures 

On
May 31, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with EF Hutton YA Fund, LP (the
 Investor ). Pursuant to the SPA, we agreed to sell the Investor three tranches of convertible debentures, in an aggregate
principal amount of 2,000,000 (the Convertible Debentures ). 

On
May 31, 2024, the first tranche of Convertible Debentures with a face amount of 500,000 (the Initial Debenture was sold to the Investor. We also agreed to sell an additional 500,000 in Convertible Debentures (the Second Closing 
and the Second Convertible Debenture upon the filing of a Definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC to seek stockholder
approval for among other things, the pending merger with Nina Footwear Corp. (the Definitive Proxy Statement ), and
 1,000,000 (the Third Closing and the Third Convertible Debenture in Convertible Debentures
on or about the date the Initial Registration Statement (as defined below) becomes effective and the approval of its stockholders as
required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, for issuances of shares in excess of the Exchange Cap (as defined below)
has been obtained (the date of such stockholder approval, the Shareholder Approval ). 

We
agreed to sell all Convertible Debentures with a 10 original issue discount, and, as a result thereof, we received 450,000 in gross
proceeds, prior to expenses, upon the sale of the Initial Debenture. The Second and Third Closings are subject to certain closing conditions,
including those discussed above, as described in greater detail in the SPA. 

The
Initial Debenture bears, and the subsequent Convertible Debentures issued under the SPA will bear, interest at an annual rate of 0.0 
per annum and will mature on May 31, 2025, as may be extended at the option of the Investor. The interest rate is subject to increase
to 18 upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default thereunder as discussed in greater detail below. 

If,
any time after the issuance date, an Amortization Event (as defined below) occurs, then the Company is required to make monthly payments
to the Investor, beginning on the 10th trading day after the date the Amortization Event occurs and continuing on the same day of each
successive calendar month in an amount equal to the sum of (i) 400,000 of principal (in the aggregate among all Convertible Debentures),
or the outstanding principal, if less than such amount (the Amortization Principal Amount ), plus (ii) a prepayment
premium of 8 of any amounts paid (the Payment Premium ), and (iii) accrued and unpaid interest as of each payment
date. The obligation of the Company to make monthly prepayments related to an Amortization Event shall cease (with respect to any payment
that has not yet come due) if any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event (A) in the event of a Floor Price Event (defined
below), either (i) on the date that is the 5th consecutive trading day that the daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) is greater
than 110 of the Floor Price (defined below) then in effect, or (ii) prior to the due date of a monthly payment, the Company has delivered
a valid Reduction Notice (defined below) and such reduced Floor Price does not exceed 50 of the market price at the time of such Reduction
Notice; or (B) in the event of an Exchange Cap Event, the date the Company has obtained Stockholder Approval to increase the number of
shares of common stock under the Exchange Cap and/or the Exchange Cap no longer applies, or (C) in the event of a Registration Event
(defined in the Registration Rights Agreement discussed below), the condition or event causing the Registration Event has been cured
or the holder is able to resell the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures in accordance with
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, unless a subsequent Amortization Event occurs. 

Amortization
Event means (i) the daily VWAP is less than the Floor Price then in effect for five trading days during a period of seven
consecutive Trading Days (a Floor Price Event ), (ii) unless the Company has obtained the approval from its stockholders
in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market for the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible
Debentures (such conversion shares in general, the Conversion Shares in excess of the Exchange Cap, the Company
has issued in excess of 99 of the common stock available under the Exchange Cap (an Exchange Cap Event ), or (iii)
any time after the Effectiveness Deadline (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) a Registration Default (as defined in the
Registration Rights Agreement) has occurred. 

18 

Pursuant
to the Convertible Debentures, we have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem early in cash a portion or all amounts outstanding
under the Convertible Debentures at the Redemption Amount (as defined below); provided that we provide the holder with at least 10 trading
days prior written notice (each, a Redemption Notice ), which Redemption Notice may only be given if the VWAP
on the date such Redemption Notice is delivered is less than the Fixed Price. The Redemption Amount means the outstanding
principal balance being redeemed by the Company, plus the Payment Premium in respect of such principal amount, plus all accrued and unpaid
interest thereunder as of such redemption date. After receipt of a Redemption Notice, the holder has ten trading days (beginning with
the trading day immediately following the date of such Redemption Notice) to elect to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal
of the Convertible Debenture plus all accrued and unpaid Interest, if any, plus the Payment Premium, if any, in respect of such Principal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless such payment requirement is waived by the Holder, the Company is entitled to make two 25,000 redemption
payments without incurring the Payment Premium and without providing the requisite 10-day notice, provided that such payments are made
pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, discussed below. 

Subject
to the Exchange Cap and the Stockholder Approval Requirement (defined below), any portion of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount
of the Convertible Debentures, together with accrued but unpaid interest, may be converted into shares of common stock of the Company
(the Conversion Shares based on a conversion price of the lower of (i) 3.3229 per share of common stock (the Fixed
Price ), or (ii) 91 of the lowest daily volume weighted average trading prices (VWAP) for the common stock during the 7 consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the conversion date or other date of determination (the Market Price ), but which
Market Price shall not be lower than the Floor Price. Notwithstanding the above, on the closing of the last trading day immediately prior
to the effective date of the initial Registration Statement (the Fixed Price Reset Date ), the Fixed Price is adjusted
(downwards only) to equal the closing price as of the Fixed Price Reset Date. Floor Price means 0.6580 per share;
provided, however, the Company may reduce the Floor Price to any amounts set forth in a written notice to the holder (a Reduction
Notice ), provided that such reduction shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to increase thereafter. 

The
Investor may convert the Convertible Debentures so long as the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion thereof
does not exceed 390,132 shares (the Exchange Cap ), provided, however, that the foregoing restriction will no longer
apply when the transactions contemplated by the SPA (as well as any other transactions that may be considered part of the same series
of transactions pursuant to and in accordance with Nasdaq rules and regulations) have been approved by the Company s stockholders
in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) (the Stockholder Approval Requirement ). Furthermore, the Convertible
Debentures may not be converted into shares of common stock to the extent such conversion would result in the Investor and its affiliates
having beneficial ownership of more than 4.99 of the Company s then outstanding shares of common stock, provided that this limitation
may be waived by the Investor upon not less than 65 days prior notice to the Company. 

Pursuant
to the SPA, the Company agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to call and hold a special or annual meeting of stockholders for
the purpose of seeking the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market for issuances
of shares in excess of the Exchange Cap. The Company also agreed to use reasonable efforts to hold the special or annual meeting prior
to the expected effectiveness of the Initial Registration Statement, or within a short time thereafter. In accordance with the rules
of the Nasdaq Capital Market, no shares of common stock beneficially owned by the Investor shall be counted in any vote in favor of the
Shareholder Approval. 

If
the Company, at any time while the Convertible Debentures are outstanding, issues or sells any shares of common stock or convertible
securities for consideration per share (the New Issuance Price less than a price equal to the Fixed Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale (such price the Applicable Price (the foregoing a Dilutive Issuance ),
then immediately after such Dilutive Issuance, the Fixed Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance
Price; provided however, the issuance of any certain Excluded Securities (defined in the Convertible Debentures) shall not be considered
a Dilutive Issuance.

by materiality, such representation or warranty shall prove to have been incorrect) when made or deemed made; or (j) any material provision
of any transaction document, at any time after its execution and delivery and for any reason other than as expressly permitted thereunder,
ceases to be in full force and effect; or the Company or any other person contests in writing the validity or enforceability of any provision
of any transaction document. 

If
an event of default under the Convertible Debentures occurs and is continuing, the full unpaid principal amount of the applicable Convertible
Debentures, together with interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, to the date of acceleration shall become, at the applicable
Investor s election by notice to the Company, immediately due and payable in cash. 

The
SPA included representations, warranties, covenants, confidentiality and indemnification obligations, customary for a transaction of
the size and type contemplated by the SPA. 

We
also agreed pursuant to the SPA to not enter into any variable rate transaction or issue or sell any equity, warrants, or debt securities
at an implied discount (taking into account all the securities issuable in such offering, including the right to receive additional shares
of common stock) to the market price of the common stock at the time of the offering in excess of 35 , until the Convertible Debentures
have been repaid in full. 

Pursuant
to the SPA, we are required to provide the Investor the right of first refusal to invest in any financing transaction pursuant to which
the Company proposes to issue and sell any securities of the Company, including any debt, equity or equity-linked securities that are
convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive common stock, or the issuance of any notes, debentures,
or other forms of indebtedness, for a period of 12 months following the date of the SPA. 

Registration
Rights Agreement 

In
connection with the entry into the SPA, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Investor (the Registration
Rights Agreement pursuant to which the Company is required to file a registration statement registering the resale by the
Investor of 1,800,000 shares of common stock issued or to be issued upon conversion of the Initial Convertible Debenture under the Securities
Act, and upon conversion of the Second Convertible Debenture and Third Convertible Debenture. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement,
the Company is required to meet certain obligations with respect to, among other things, the timeliness of the filing and effectiveness
of registration statements. 

The
Company is required to file a registration statement related to the shares issuable upon conversion of the Initial Convertible Debenture
(the Initial Registration Statement no later than August 23, 2024 in the event the SEC does not review the Definitive
Proxy Statement, and October 7, 2024 in the event the SEC reviews the Definitive Proxy Statement, and obtain effectiveness thereof by
the earlier of (A) the 60th calendar day following the filing date thereof (the Filing Deadline and (B) the fifth
business day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that such Registration Statement
will not be reviewed or will not be subject to further review. 

20 

We were not able to meet the filing deadline for the Initial Registration
Statement and have not filed the Initial Registration Statement to date. As a result, an event of default has occurred under the Convertible
Debenture; however, the Investor has not yet provided us notice of the acceleration of amounts due thereunder. At any time, until we cure
such default, the Investor can provide us notice that the full unpaid principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Debenture, together
with interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, is immediately due and payable in cash. We do not currently have sufficient
cash on hand to pay amounts due under the Convertible Debenture and if such amount was immediately due and payable we would need to raise
additional funding through the sale of debt or equity, which funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and/or sell assets,
and may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could cause the securities of the Company to become worthless. 

The
Registration Rights Agreement includes certain other piggyback and demand registration rights, obligations of the Company and the Investor,
and indemnification obligations of the parties, each as described in greater detail therein. 

Global
Guaranty Agreement 

In
connection with the entry into the SPA and the issuance of the Initial Convertible Debenture, Kidpik Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), entered into a Global Guaranty Agreement with the Investor (the Guaranty ),
pursuant to which Merger Sub agreed to guaranty all of the Company s obligations under the SPA and Convertible Debentures. 

Loan
and Finance Agreements 

On
or around February 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Merchant Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement with WebBank,
whereby the Company borrowed 240,000 from WebBank and incurred financing costs of 31,200. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the repayment
rate is 17 of daily sales and the term of the loan is eighteen months. A total of 271,000 is due to WebBank pursuant to the terms of
the agreement. The Company provided WebBank a security interest in its assets, other than real estate, to secure the repayment of the
Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement includes customary events of default and covenants of the Company for a transaction of the size and
type as the Loan Agreement. We agreed to pay 30 of the amount owed during the first six months of the agreement, and 30 of the amount
owed during the following six months, and to pay 17 of the daily payment due to the Company from the Company s Shopify Account
Credits. 

On
or around May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Commercial Insurance Premium Finance and Security Agreement (the Insurance
Premium Finance Agreement with Aon Premium Finance, LLC APF ), whereby the Company paid APF 17,263
and financed 180,737, with monthly payments due of 17,263, based on an annual interest rate of 9.99 , in connection with amounts due
under the Company s officer and director insurance policy. The Company provided APF a security interest in the Company s
director and officer insurance policy including among other things any unearned premiums. The amount financed is due in 11 monthly installments
of 17,263 each. 

Need
for Future Funding, Review of Strategic Alternatives 

As
discussed above, we are not currently purchasing any new products as we work to sell our current inventory. We expect to continue to
generate net losses for the foreseeable future. The Company s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon obtaining new
financing for its ongoing operations, including from the expected sale of the Second Convertible Debenture and Third Convertible Debenture,
as discussed above. Future financing options which may be available to the Company in addition to the convertible notes, include equity
financings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions to
fund existing operations and execute management s growth strategy, and borrowings from related parties, including Ezra Dabah, our
Chief Executive Officer and Nina Footwear. Such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all and may cause
significant dilution to existing stockholders. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the Company s
stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company
to fund continued operations, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results
of operations, and it could ultimately be forced to discontinue its operations, enter into bankruptcy and/or liquidate. These matters,
when considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable
period of time, which is defined as within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying financial
statements do not contain any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

We
plan to focus our resources on closing the Merger, discussed above under Recent Events , Merger Agreement ,
which we expect will strengthen our balance sheet and allow the Company to meet the Nasdaq Equity Rule requirements, upon closing.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
condensed interim financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of condensed interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reporting values of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed
interim financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates
and assumptions are those used in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets and inventory obsolescence. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future
financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 

Our
critical accounting estimates are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the 2023 Annual Report and in Note
2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited financial statements appearing in the 2023 Annual Report. During
the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed
in our 2023 Annual Report. 

JOBS
Act and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The
JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private
companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act,
for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the
earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. 

We
have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and we do not believe that
there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Refer
to Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

22 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, principally personal
injury and property casualty claims. Those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure by us of significant financial
and managerial resources. We are not party to any material legal proceedings at this time. We may become involved in material legal proceedings
in the future. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Reference
is made to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors included in our 2023 Annual Report for information concerning risk factors,
which should be read in conjunction with the factors set forth in Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
of this Report. There have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, except as set
forth below. You should carefully consider such factors in the 2023 Annual Report, and below, which could materially affect our business,
financial condition or future results. 

The
risks described in the 2023 Annual Report and below, are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not
currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition
and/or operating results. 

There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we will need additional capital which may not be available
on favorable terms, if at all. 

We
have experienced net losses in each year since our inception. We had accumulated deficits of 55,399,032 and 51,440,227 as of September
28, 2024, and December 30, 2023, respectively. For the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023, we incurred net losses
of 887,944 and 1,925,951, respectively. For the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023, we incurred net losses of
 3,958,805 and 5,905,688, respectively. On September 28, 2024, we had 3,205 of cash on hand (excluding restricted cash of 4,618),
 4,165,074 in total current assets, 7,009,066 in total current liabilities, and a working capital deficit of 2,843,992. The Company s
ability to continue its operations is dependent upon obtaining new financing for its ongoing operations and on the Company s plans
to reduce the inventory level. To manage operating cash flows in the near term, the Company has stopped purchasing new inventory and
if available, may enter into cash advance or other financing arrangements. Future financing options available to the Company include
equity financings, debt financings (similar to the 500,000 of Convertible Debentures which we have sold and the 1.5 million of additional
Convertible Debentures we have agreed to sell for 1.35 million, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, as discussed in further
detail under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations or other
capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions to fund existing operations and execute
management s growth strategy, and borrowings from related parties, including Ezra Dabah, our Chief Executive Officer and Nina Footwear.
Equity financings may include sales of common stock, warrants and/or preferred stock. Such financing may not be available on terms favorable
to the Company or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the Company s stockholders
and may cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance
that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continued operations,
if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations, and it could ultimately
be forced to discontinue its operations, seek bankruptcy protection and/or liquidate. These matters, when considered in the aggregate,
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is defined
as within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed interim financial statements do
not contain any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The doubt regarding our potential ability to continue as a going
concern may adversely affect our ability to obtain new financing on reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, if we are unable to continue
as a going concern, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company. If we are unable to access additional capital
moving forward, it may hurt our ability to grow and to generate future revenue or may force us to seek bankruptcy protection and any
investment in the Company could be lost as part of any bankruptcy proceeding. 

23 

There
is no guarantee that our common stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market. 

Our
common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol PIK . There is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain
our listing on Nasdaq for any period of time. Among the conditions required for continued listing on Nasdaq, Nasdaq requires us to maintain
at least 2.5 million in stockholders equity, 35 million in market value of listed securities, or 500,000 in net income over
the prior two years or two of the prior three years, to have a majority of independent directors (subject to certain controlled
company exemptions, which we currently have the ability to take advantage of and currently take advantage of), to comply with
certain audit committee requirements, and to maintain a stock price over 1.00 per share, which we have not maintained from time to time
in the past. 

On
April 16, 2024, the Company received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that
its stockholders equity as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 30, 2023 (the Form
10-K ), did not meet the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders equity of at least
 2,500,000 (the Equity Rule ). 

Nasdaq gave the Company until
May 31, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance, which plan was timely submitted. The plan discussed our expectation to regain
compliance with the Equity Rule upon the closing of the Merger. At the time of the filing of the plan of compliance, the Company also
advised Nasdaq that it was the Company s expectation to regain compliance with the Equity Rule by October 14, 2024 (180 days after
the date from the original deficiency notification, which is the maximum amount of time the Staff can provide, in its discretion, for
an issuer to regain compliance with the Equity Rule). 

Due to unforeseen delays in completing
the required Nina Footwear financial statements and pro forma information, we were unfortunately delayed in filing the required proxy
statement necessary to seek stockholder approval for the issuance of common stock in connection with the Merger, and therefore have been
delayed in completing the Merger. 

As a result, on October 2, 2024,
the Company received a delist determination letter from the Staff advising the Company that as a result of our failure to file the proxy
statement, and because Nasdaq has determined that it would not be possible for the Merger to close before October 14, 2024, the Staff
has determined that the Company did not provide a definitive plan evidencing its ability to achieve compliance with the continued listing
requirements and to deny the Company s request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

The Company submitted a hearing
request to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), which request stayed any delisting action by the Staff at least
until the hearing process concludes and any extension granted by the Panel expires. 

At the Panel hearing, the Company
intends to present a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement, which is expected to be based
around the closing of the planned Merger. In the interim, the Company s common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the
symbol PIK at least pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. 

There can be no assurance that
the Company s plan will be accepted by the Panel or that, if it is, the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable
Nasdaq listing requirements. If the Company s common stock is delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company s
common stock or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting
could also impair the Company s ability to raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements or securities
of the Company. 

The
Company remains committed to completing the Merger. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to timely file such
definitive proxy statement, and/or that the Company will be able to complete the transactions necessary to regain compliance with the
Equity Rule, including the Merger. 

Even
if we demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing
requirements to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common
stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq Capital Market
listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our common stock, the sale or purchase of
our common stock would likely be made more difficult, and the trading volume and liquidity of our common stock could decline. Delisting
from The Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional
capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other
parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of
our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders
to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade
on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB Market or the OTC Pink market, where an investor may find it more difficult
to sell our common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common. In the event our common stock is delisted
from The Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation
on an over-the counter quotation system. 

24 

Risks
Related to the Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement 

The
number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement will cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. 

Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, upon the Closing of the Merger, the stockholders of Nina Footwear are expected to collectively own approximately
80 of the Company s then outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, the total shares of common stock issuable upon closing
of the Merger Agreement (will cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. Additionally, the Nina Footwear stockholders will
be issued an increased number of shares of common stock of the Company as the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company increases
prior to Closing. Specifically, for each one share of common stock of the Company issued prior to Closing, the Nina Footwear stockholders
will be issued four additional shares of common stock. As a result, if the Company issues any equity compensation, sells any shares in
any offerings, or otherwise issues any shares of common stock prior to Closing, the Nina Footwear stockholders will receive additional
shares of common stock (compared to the number of shares of common stock due as of the date of this Report), so that they will retain
their 80 post-Closing ownership of the Company. Such additional issuances will in turn cause significant dilution to the stockholders
of the Company. 

The
number of shares of common stock that will be issuable in the Merger Agreement are not adjustable based on the market price of the Company s
common stock, so the shares issued at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than the market price at the time the Merger Agreement
was signed. 

The
number of shares of common stock issuable at the closing of the Merger Agreement is not fixed but is also not based on the trading price
of the Company s common stock. If the Company issues any shares of common stock prior to the closing of the Merger the number of
shares of common stock issuable to the Nina Stockholders pursuant to the Merger will increase proportionally such that at Closing of
the Merger the Nina Stockholders will hold 80 of the Company s, then outstanding shares of common stock. However, any changes
in the market price of the Company s common stock before the closing will not affect the number of shares the Nina Stockholders
will be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Therefore, if before the closing, the market price of the Company s
common stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger, then the Nina Stockholders could receive consideration with a
substantially lower value. Similarly, if before the completion of the Merger, the market price of the Company s common stock increases
from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then the Nina Stockholders could receive consideration with substantially
more value for their shares of Nina Footwear than was the case upon the parties initial entry into the Merger Agreement, on which
the last trading day prior to such date, the Company s common stock closed at 4.57 per share. The Merger Agreement does not include
a price-based termination right. 

The
Company s stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management
of, the combined company following the completion of the Merger. 

Pursuant
to the Merger, following the closing of the Merger, the Nina Stockholders are expected to collectively own 80 of the Company s
then outstanding shares of common stock, with the Company s current stockholders holding 20 of the Company s then outstanding
shares of common stock. Mr. Dabah and his children own approximately 79.3 of Nina Footwear, and Mr. Dabah and his extended family own
100 of Nina Footwear, and Moshe Dabah (Mr. Dabah s son) is the Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer
of the Company, and the Secretary of Nina Footwear. Mr. Dabah and his family will continue to control approximately 75 of the combined
company s voting shares following the closing of the Merger. Consequently, the Company s stockholders will be able to exercise
less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently exercise over the management and policies
of the Company, and Mr. Dabah s beneficial ownership of the Company, and therefore control over the Company, will increase significantly
as a result of the Merger. 

The
consummation of the Merger will increase the voting rights of Ezra Dabah, our Chief Executive Officer and Director. 

Due
to the significant number of shares issuable at the closing of the Merger, the percentage ownership of Mr. Ezra Dabah will increase his
beneficial ownership in the Company from 59.4 as of the date of this Report, to approximately 75.3 as of the closing date of the Merger,
and Mr. Dabah will exercise control in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election
and removal of directors, mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent
or cause a further change in control. 

25 

Any
investors who purchase shares or hold shares will be minority stockholders and as such will have little to no say in the direction of
the Company and the election of directors. Additionally, it will be difficult for investors to remove the directors appointed by Mr.
Dabah, which will mean they will remain in control of who serves as officers of the Company as well as whether any changes are made in
the board. An owner of the Company s securities should keep in mind that their shares, and their voting of such shares, will likely
have little effect on the outcome of corporate decisions. 

The
Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to combine with us on more favorable terms while
the Merger is pending. 

The
Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to us that might
result in greater value to our stockholders than the Merger. These provisions include a general prohibition on us from soliciting, or,
subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing
transactions. 

Failure
to complete the acquisition of Nina Footwear could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results. 

If
the acquisition of Nina Footwear is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to a number
of risks, including the following: 

we
 will not realize the benefits expected from the acquisition of Nina Footwear, including a potentially enhanced competitive and financial
 position, expansion of assets and operations, and economies of scale, and therefore opportunities, and will instead be subject to
 all the risks we currently face as an independent company; 

we
 may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our partners and employees; 

the
 Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the acquisition of Nina Footwear
 or the termination of the Merger Agreement. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the counterparties
 to such agreement, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing
 business opportunities during the pendency of the Merger Agreement; 

matters
 relating to the acquisition of Nina Footwear (including integration planning, negotiation of the merger agreement and ancillary agreements,
 required proxy statements and other disclosures) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which
 would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us; and 

we
 may be unable to comply with the Equity Rule, resulting in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

We
will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the acquisition of Nina Footwear is pending. 

Uncertainty
about the effect of the acquisition of Nina Footwear on employees and partners may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties
may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the acquisition of Nina Footwear is completed, and could cause
partners and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or cause potential
new partners to delay doing business with us until the acquisition of Nina Footwear has been successfully completed or terminated. In
addition, the acquisition of Nina Footwear restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the
acquisition of Nina Footwear is completed without certain consents and approvals. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive
business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the acquisition of Nina Footwear or the termination of the Merger Agreement. 

26 

The
Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the acquisition of Nina Footwear may not be completed. 

The
Merger Agreement is subject to several conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the acquisition of Nina Footwear and contains
certain termination rights, including: (i) the right of either party to terminate the Merger Agreement if (1) the Merger is not consummated
by December 31, 2024, subject to certain extension rights, provided that the parties to the Merger are currently in discussions
regarding an extension of such date to March 31, 2025, (2) if Kidpik s stockholders fail to adopt and approve the issuance
of the Merger shares pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), or (3) the other party breaches any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement, the result of which prohibits certain conditions of Closing from occurring; (ii) the
right of Kidpik to terminate the Merger Agreement (1) if Nina Footwear s stockholders fail to adopt and approve the Merger, (2)
if the Nina Footwear s board of directors changes or withdraws its recommendation in favor of the Merger or recommends to enter
into an alternative transaction and (3) if certain financial statements have not been provided by Nina Footwear to Kidpik in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement; and (iii) the right of Nina Footwear to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Kidpik board of
directors changes or withdraws its recommendation in favor of the Merger or recommends the entry into an alternative transaction. The
required conditions to closing may not be fulfilled and/or the Merger Agreement may be terminated pursuant to its terms and accordingly,
the acquisition of Nina Footwear may not be completed. 

Failure
to complete the Merger could negatively impact the Company s stock price and future business and financial results. 

If
the Merger is not completed, the Company will be subject to several risks, including the following: 

the
 Company may experience negative reactions from suppliers, vendors, landlords, joint venture partners and other business partners; 

certain
 amounts for which the Company may be liable under the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including a break-fee of 100,000,
 plus the required reimbursement of legal expenses of up to 62,500; 

payment
 for certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and
 printing fees; 

payment
 of interest due as a result of any financing required to fund the Merger, and repayment of any loans incurred in raising capital
 to fund costs incurred in connection with the Merger; 

certain
 costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; 

negative
 reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of the Company s stock due to the fact that current prices
 may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; 

diverted
 attention of Company management to the Merger rather than to the Company s operations and pursuit of other opportunities that
 could have been beneficial to it; 

litigation
 related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against the Company to perform its
 obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement; and 

we
 may be unable to comply with the Equity Rule, resulting in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

27 

If
the Merger is not completed, the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on the Company s
results of operations, cash flows, financial position and stock price. 

The
Company s stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience
in connection with the Merger. 

If
the Company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits anticipated from the Merger, the Company s stockholders
will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving
part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits
currently anticipated from the Purchase. 

The
Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. 

The
success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, the Company s ability to combine the Company and Nina Footwear in a manner
that realizes the various benefits, growth opportunities and synergies identified by combining the Company s operations with those
of Nina Footwear. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. It is uncertain
whether the Company and Nina Footwear can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. 

In
addition, the integration of the operations of the Company and Nina Footwear following the Merger will require the attention of the Company s
management and other personnel, which may distract their attention from the Company s day-to-day business and operations and prevent
the Company from realizing benefits from other opportunities. Completing the integration process may be more expensive than anticipated,
and the Company may be unable to affect the integration of these operations smoothly or efficiently or that the anticipated benefits
of the Merger will be achieved. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

We
may not sell additional Convertible Debentures and as such may not receive the 1.35 million payable by the Investor upon the sale of
the additional Convertible Debentures. The 500,000 Convertible Debenture is currently in default. 

On
May 31, 2024, the Company entered into the SPA with the Investor, pursuant to which the Company sold Convertible Debentures for 450,000,
with a face amount of 500,000. Upon the filing of a Definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC to seek stockholder approval for, among
other things, the pending merger with Nina Footwear Corp., and subject to certain other conditions, the Investor agreed to purchase an
additional 500,000 of Convertible Debentures for 450,000, and on or about the date the Initial Registration Statement becomes effective
and the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market for issuances of shares in excess
of the Exchange Cap, the Investor has agreed to purchase an additional 1,000,000 in Convertible Debentures for 900,000. 

We were not able to meet the filing deadline for the Initial Registration
Statement and have not filed the Initial Registration Statement to date. As a result, an event of default has occurred under the initial
Convertible Debenture; however, the Investor has not yet provided us notice of the acceleration of amounts due thereunder. At any time,
until we cure such default, the Investor can provide us notice that the full unpaid principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Debenture,
together with interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, is immediately due and payable in cash. We do not currently have sufficient
cash on hand to pay amounts due under the Convertible Debenture and if such amount was immediately due and payable we would need to raise
additional funding through the sale of debt or equity, which funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and/or sell assets,
and may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could cause the securities of the Company to become worthless. 

We may not
satisfy the conditions to the sale of the additional Convertible Debentures, and/or the Investor may not purchase such additional Convertible Debentures
if we remain in default of the initial Convertible Debenture, and we may not receive the additional 1.35 million payable
by the Investor for such additional Convertible Debentures. As a result, we may need to obtain funding from alternative sources, which
may not be available on as favorable terms, if at all. The lack of funding may negatively affect our ability to pay debts and expenses
as they become due, force us to scale back our business plan, prevent us from completing the Merger, or potentially force us to seek
bankruptcy protection. 

The
issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures will cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing shareholders. 

Assuming
the Stockholder Approval Requirement is met, holders of Convertible Debentures may, at their option, convert any portion of the outstanding
and unpaid principal amount of the Convertible Debentures, together with accrued but unpaid interest, into shares of common stock of
the Company based on a conversion price of the lower of (i) 3.3229 per share of common stock (Floor Price), or (ii) 91 of the lowest
daily volume weighted average trading prices (VWAP) for the common stock during the seven consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the conversion date or other date of determination (Market Price), but which Market Price shall not be lower than the Floor Price. 

28 

Notwithstanding
the above, on the closing of the last trading day immediately prior to the effective date of the Initial Registration Statement filed
by the Company to register the resale of the Conversion Shares (Fixed Price Reset Date), the Fixed Price is adjusted (downwards only)
to equal the closing price as of the Fixed Price Reset Date. Floor Price is currently 0.6580 per share provided; however, the Company
may reduce the Floor Price to any amounts set forth in a written notice to the holder, provided that such reduction shall be irrevocable
and shall not be subject to increase thereafter. If the Company, at any time while the Convertible Debentures are outstanding, issues
or sells any shares of common stock or convertible securities for consideration per share less than a price equal to the Fixed Price
in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale, then immediately after such Dilutive Issuance, the Fixed Price then in effect shall
be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price, provided however, the issuance of any certain Excluded Securities (defined in
the Convertible Debentures) shall not be considered a Dilutive Issuance. Until the Stockholder Approval Requirement is met, the Convertible
Debentures may not be converted into more than 390,132 total shares of common stock. 

The
issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests
of other stockholders since the holders of the Convertible Debentures may ultimately receive and sell the full amount of shares issuable
in connection with the conversion of such Convertible Debentures. Although the Convertible Debentures may not be converted by the holders
thereof if such conversion would cause such holder to own more than 4.99 of our outstanding common stock (which may be increased with
at least 65 days prior written notice), these restrictions do not prevent such holders from converting some of their holdings, selling
those shares, and then converting the rest of their holdings, while still staying below the 4.99 limit. In this way, the holders of
the Convertible Debentures could sell more than these limits while never actually holding more shares than the limits allow. If the holders
of the Convertible Debentures choose to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our common stock. 

The
availability of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures for public resale, as well as any actual resales
of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our
common stock upon the conversion of our Convertible Debentures, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our
common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock upon
the conversion of our Convertible Debentures, or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common
stock to decline. 

In
addition, the common stock issuable upon the conversion of our Convertible Debentures may represent overhang that may also adversely
affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company s stock in the market
than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders
attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb shares
sold by holders of the Convertible Debentures, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease. 

We
are required to file a registration statement to permit the public resale of the shares of common stock that may be issued upon the conversion
of the Convertible Debentures, provided that we are currently in default of such obligation. The influx of those shares into the public market could potentially have a negative effect on the trading
price of our common stock. 

We
are required to make amortization payments of the amounts owed under the Convertible Debentures upon the occurrence of certain events, including the occurrence of an event of default, which has occurred to
date,
and we may not have sufficient cash to make such payments, if required. 

If,
any time after the issuance date, an Amortization Event occurs, then the Company is required to make monthly payments to holders of the
Convertible Debentures, beginning on the 10th trading day after the date the Amortization Event occurs and continuing on the same day
of each successive calendar month in an amount equal to the sum of (i) 400,000 of principal (in the aggregate among all Convertible
Debentures), or the outstanding principal, if less than such amount, plus (ii) a prepayment premium of 8 of any amounts paid, and (iii)
accrued and unpaid interest as of each payment date. 

29 

The
obligation of the Company to make monthly prepayments related to an Amortization Event shall cease (with respect to any payment that
has not yet come due) if any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event (A) in the event of a Floor Price Event, either (i) on
the date that is the 5th consecutive trading day that the daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) is greater than 110 of the Floor
Price then in effect, or (ii) prior to the due date of a monthly payment, the Company has delivered a valid Reduction Notice and such
reduced Floor Price does not exceed 50 of the market price at the time of such Reduction Notice; or (B) in the event of an Exchange
Cap Event, the date the Company has obtained Stockholder Approval to increase the number of shares of common stock under the Exchange
Cap and/or the Exchange Cap no longer applies, or (C) in the event of a Registration Event (defined in the Registration Rights Agreement
discussed below), the condition or event causing the Registration Event has been cured or the holder is able to resell the shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, unless a subsequent
Amortization Event occurs. 

Amortization
Events include if (i) the daily VWAP is less than the Floor Price then in effect for five trading days during a period of seven consecutive
Trading Days, (ii) unless the Company has obtained the approval from its stockholders in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Capital
Market for the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures in excess of the Exchange Cap, the Company
has issued in excess of 99 of 390,132 shares of common prior to receiving stockholder approval for the issuance of the Conversion Shares,
or (iii) default of the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Convertible Debentures, has occurred under
certain circumstances. 

The
Company is required to file a registration statement related to the shares issuable upon conversion of 500,000 of the Convertible Debentures
no later than August 23, 2024 in the event the SEC does not review the Proxy Statement, and October 7, 2024 in the event the SEC reviews
this Proxy Statement, and obtain effectiveness thereof by the earlier of (A) the 60th calendar day following the filing date thereof
and (B) the fifth business day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that such
Registration Statement will not be reviewed or will not be subject to further review. 

We were not able to meet the filing deadline for the Initial Registration
Statement and have not filed the Initial Registration Statement to date. As a result, an event of default has occurred under the Convertible
Debenture; however, the Investor has not yet provided us notice of the acceleration of amounts due thereunder. At any time, until we cure
such default, the Investor can provide us notice that the full unpaid principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Debenture, together
with interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, is immediately due and payable in cash. We do not currently have sufficient
cash on hand to pay amounts due under the Convertible Debenture and if such amount was immediately due and payable we would need to raise
additional funding through the sale of debt or equity, which funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and/or sell assets,
and may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could cause the securities of the Company to become worthless. 

We
may not have cash available to pay the required amortization payments. The failure to timely file (which has occurred to date), or
obtain effectiveness of, or maintain the effectiveness of, the required registration statement, will trigger the requirement that we
make amortization payments upon the request of the Investor, and will reduce the conversion price of the Convertible Debentures, which will cause significant
dilution to existing stockholders. The occurrence of an Amortization Event may force us to raise additional funding, which funding
may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, may result in the Convertible Debentures being in default and the holders
thereof having the right to require the immediate repayment of such Convertible Debentures, plus penalties, may force us to sell
assets, curtail our operations, may prevent us from completing the Merger or delay the Merger, and could force us to seek bankruptcy
protection. 

The
Convertible Debentures include anti-dilution and reset rights. 

We
currently have 500,000 of Convertible Debentures outstanding, and as discussed below, have agreed to sell up to an additional 1,500,000
of Convertible Debentures upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Convertible Debentures currently have a conversion Floor Price
of 0.6580 per share. If the Company, at any time while the Convertible Debentures are outstanding, issues or sells any shares of common
stock or convertible securities, for consideration per share less than a price equal to the Fixed Price in effect immediately prior to
such issue or sale, then immediately after such Dilutive Issuance the Fixed Price then in effect is reduced to an amount equal to the
New Issuance Price, provided however, the issuance of any certain Excluded Securities (defined in the Convertible Debentures) shall not
be considered a Dilutive Issuance. The reduction of the Floor Price of the Convertible Debentures in the event that we offer, sell, grant
or issue, or are deemed to have offered, sold, granted or issued shares of common stock below the then Floor Price of the Convertible
Debentures, could result in the Company receiving significantly less consideration upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures
(or in some cases only nominal consideration), will result in greater dilution to existing stockholders upon the conversion of the Convertible
Debentures, and/or may create additional overhang for our common stock. Any or all of the above could have a material adverse effect
on the trading price of our common stock.
