units at an offering price of per unit (the Public Units ), generating gross proceeds of . Simultaneously with the IPO, the Company sold to its Sponsor units at per unit (the Private Units in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. 

The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to additional Public Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On April 27, 2022, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased Public Units at a price of per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of . Simultaneously with the closing of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional aggregate of Private Units with the Sponsor at a price of per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of . 

Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees (payable only upon completion of a Business Combination) and of other offering costs. 

Upon the closing of the IPO and the private placement on April 22, 2022, and the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the additional Private Units on April 27, 2022, a total of was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company as a trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), and that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. These funds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination and the liquidation due to the Company s failure to complete a Business Combination within the applicable period of time. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public stockholders. In addition, interest income earned on the funds in the Trust Account may be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations. With these exceptions, expenses incurred by the Company may be paid prior to a business combination only from the net proceeds of the IPO and private placement not held in the Trust Account. 

Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the Company s initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least of the value of the funds in the Trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account), which the Company refers to as the 80 test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for its initial Business Combination, although the Company may structure a Business Combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80 of the trust account balance. If the Company is no longer listed on Nasdaq, it will not be required to satisfy the 80 test. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be 10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations). 

The Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority
of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does
not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender
offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing
a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder
approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the
proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares
irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with
a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor and any of the Company s officers or directors that may hold Insider Shares
(as defined in Note 5) (the Initial Stockholders and the underwriters have agreed (a) to vote their Insider Shares, Private
Shares (as defined in Note 4), Shares issued as underwriting commissions (see Note 6) and any Public Shares purchased during or after
the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any shares (including the Insider Shares) in connection with
a stockholder vote to approve, or sell the shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with, a proposed Business Combination. 

If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20 or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The Initial Stockholders and underwriters have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Insider Shares, Private Shares, and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem 100 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

Initially, the Company had until 9 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination. In addition, if the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate initial business combination within 9 months, the Company s insiders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of 15 months to complete a business combination) (the Combination Period ). In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliate or designees must deposit into the Trust Account , or 1,150,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full per Public Share in either case or an aggregate of (or 2,300,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full)), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. 

On April 19, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the April Special Meeting ). During the April Special Meeting, stockholders approved (i) an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from April 22, 2023 to April 22, 2024 on a month-by-month basis and (ii) an amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company giving the Company s right to extend the time to complete a business combination twelve times for an additional one month each time from April 22, 2023 to April 22, 2024 by depositing to the Trust Account for each one-month extension. In connection with the stockholders vote at the special meeting, an aggregate of shares with redemption value of approximately (or 10.29 per share) of the Company s common stock were tendered for redemption. 

On September 22, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the September Special Meeting ). During the September Special Meeting, stockholders approved (i) an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from September 22, 2023 to August 22, 2024 and (ii) an amendment to the Company s Trust Agreement as amended on April 19, 2023 to provide that the time for the Company to complete its initial business combination under the Trust Agreement shall be extended from September 22, 2023 to August 22, 2024 without depositing any additional funds to the Trust Account. Additionally, the Company and the Sponsor entered into agreements with several third parties in exchange for them agreeing not to redeem shares of the Company s common stock sold in its IPO (See Note 6). In connection with the stockholders vote at the special meeting, an aggregate of shares with redemption value of approximately (or 10.66 per share) of the Company s common stock were tendered for redemption; the entire amount was paid to the redeemed public stockholders on October 16, 2023. 

On
August 22, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the August Special Meeting ). During the August
Special Meeting, stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend
the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from August 22, 2024 to October 22, 2025 on a monthly
basis by depositing an amount equal to 0.04 multiplied by the number of shares of common stock sold to the public in the IPO and that
remain outstanding after giving effect to the shares that were redeemed in connection with the August Special Meeting. In connection with
the stockholders vote at the August Special Meeting, an aggregate of shares with redemption value of approximately
 .95 (or 11.27 per share) of the Company s common stock were tendered for redemption. Yotta subsequently deposited
 .20 into the Trust Account per month to extend the date by which the Company can complete an initial business combination until
November 22, 2024. 

The Company has until 42 months (or by October 22, 2025) from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less certain amount of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The Sponsor and the other Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Insider Shares, and Private Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or the other Initial Stockholders acquires Public Shares in or after the IPO, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than 10.00. 

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below 10.00 per Public Share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims.

Nasdaq
Notice 

On May 7, 2024, Yotta received written notice
from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq stating that Yotta was not in compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) because the Company had not maintained a minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Securities
(of at least 15 million). Yotta was given until November 4, 2024 to regain compliance. On the same date, Yotta received written
notice from Nasdaq stating that Yotta was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b) because it had not maintained a
minimum publicly held shares. Yotta was given 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. In response to these
notices, Yotta applied for a transfer from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. On July 1, 2024, Yotta s
application was approved by Nasdaq on the following conditions: (i) Yotta enter into a business combination agreement no later than
August 25, 2024, (ii) Yotta file a registration statement on Form S-4 no later than October 12, 2024, and (iii) Yotta

Liquidity and Going Concern Consideration 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of
 
 and a working capital deficit of .
On August 22, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from August 22, 2024 to October 22, 2025
on a monthly basis by depositing .20
per month into the Trust Account. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the extended
date (or October 22, 2025 if the Sponsor elects to extend the consummation deadline). Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional
financing either to complete its Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares
upon consummation of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection
with such Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by October 22, 2025, there will be a mandatory liquidation
and subsequent dissolution. 

The Company expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon consummation of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete its Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available, it will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following the Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, the Company may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet its obligations. 

In connection with the Company s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined
that if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by October 22, 2025, then the Company will cease all operations except
for the purpose of liquidating. The date for liquidation and subsequent dissolution as well as liquidity concerns raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

In February 2022, an armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The sanctions announced by the United States and other countries against Russia and Belarus following Russia s invasion of Ukraine to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services, or technology in or from affected regions and travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business, and financial organizations in Russia and Belarus. The United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Separately, in October 2023, Israel and certain Iranian-backed Palestinian forces began an armed conflict in Israel, the Gaza Strip, and surrounding areas, which threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries including Lebanon and Iran. 

As a result of the ongoing Russia/Ukraine, Hamas/Israel conflicts and/or other future global conflicts, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and potential future sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. 

Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. 

The IR Act tax provisions had an impact on the
Company s fiscal 2023 tax provision as there were redemptions by the public stockholders in April 2023,
September 2023 and August 2024; as a result, the Company recorded total excise tax liability 
and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the second quarter 2024, the Internal
Revenue Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the Excise Tax. Pursuant to those regulations,
the Company would need to file a return and remit payment for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to
December 31, 2023 on or before October 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not filed its 2023 excise tax return and remitted excise tax payment. The Company will continue
to monitor for updates to the Company s business along with guidance issued with respect to the IR Act to determine whether any
adjustments are needed to the Company s tax provision in future periods. 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, due to non-deductible transaction costs and the change in valuation of deferred tax
assets. 

ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. 

The Company recognizes accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and unpaid income taxes as income tax expense. There were 
unrecognized tax benefits and 
amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were interest and penalties related to 2023 underpayment of income taxes which will be recognized in the fourth quarter
of 2024. The Company is currently not
aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

The Company has identified the United States as its only major tax jurisdiction. The Company is subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

Public Units at per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of . The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to additional Public Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On April 27, 2022, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased Public Units at a price of per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of . Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one right Public Right and one redeemable warrant Public Warrant ). Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of a Business Combination. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of 11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. Because the Warrants may only be exercised for whole numbers of shares, only an even number of warrants may be exercised. The Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the IPO, and will expire five years after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

All of the Public Shares sold as part of the Public Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or in connection with the Company s liquidation. In accordance with the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. 

The Company s redeemable common stock is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

The Private Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants except that the Private Warrants and the common shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until after the completion of a Business Combination. The proceeds from the Private Units were added to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Units and all underlying securities will expire worthless.

The Company granted Chardan for a period of 18 months after the date of the consummation of the Company s Business Combination, a right of first refusal to act as book-running manager, with at least 30 of the economics, or, in the case of a three-handed deal 20 of the economics, for any and all future public and private equity and debt offerings. 

Business Combination Marketing Agreement 

The Company engaged EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. EarlyBirdCapital pursuant to a Finder s Engagement Agreement dated November 2, 2023, to assist the Company with introductions to potential
target businesses in connection to its initial business combination. Yotta agreed to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee equal to one percent
(1 of the total consideration, (the total value of all cash, securities or other property paid at the closing or closings) of a transaction
between the Company and a target business. 

shares of common stock with a par value of per share. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. In March 2022, the Sponsor surrendered 1,150,000 shares of common stock without any consideration and in April 2022, the Sponsor declared a dividend, payable in shares of common stock, of two-thirds of one share of common stock for each share of common stock issued and outstanding. As a result of the underwriters full exercise of their over-allotment option on April 27, 2022, no Insider Shares are currently subject to forfeiture. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were Insider Shares issued and outstanding. 

Rights Each holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the IPO. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively covert its rights in order to receive 1/10 share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, holders of the rights might not receive the shares of common stock underlying the rights. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were rights issued and outstanding. 

Public Warrants Each redeemable Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per full share, and will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial Business Combination and 12 months from the closing of the IPO. However, no Public Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the issuance of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within days from the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years from the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination at 5:00 p.m., New York City time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company s initial Business Combination, and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Price is below 9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115 of the Market Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described below will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165 of the Market Value. 

Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per Public Warrant; 

upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption, which the Company refers to as the 30-day redemption period; 

if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock equals or exceeds 16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the to the warrant holders. 

If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the common stock for the trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. 

Except as described above, no warrants will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue common stock unless at the time a holder seeks to exercise such warrant, a prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the common stock have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to do so and, if the Company does not maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants and the Company will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not current or if the common stock is not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the Company will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise, the warrants may have no value, the market for the warrants may be limited and the warrants may expire worthless. 

Private Warrants The
private warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this
offering except that the private warrants will be entitled to registration rights. The private warrants (including the common stock
issuable upon exercise of the private warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until after the completion of our
initial business combination except to permitted transferees. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 
warrants issued and outstanding.

(as defined in the Merger Agreement) up to an aggregate of 2,950,000 of the Company s preferred stock upon the consummation of
the Business Combination (the Amendment ). Pursuant to the Amendment, 
immediately before the closing of the Business Combination, the Bridge Financing Notes shall be

Upon execution of the Note SPA, the investor purchased the full value of the OID Convertible Note for

the closing of the Business Combination, in nine (9) tranches with each tranche having a purchase price of 5 million. Each
purchase of shares of preferred stock under the PIPE SPA is for a number of shares of preferred stock equal to the aggregate purchase
price paid by the investor plus a 10 increase, multiplied by 3.25 and divided by the Stated Value (as defined in the PIPE SPA) of the
preferred stock. 

The
conversion of the convertible note and the closing of the purchases of preferred stock pursuant to the PIPE SPA are subject to certain
conditions that must be satisfied or waived by the investor, including (i) the investor has entered into a registration rights agreement
in a form to be reasonably acceptable to the investor including terms and conditions customary to registration rights agreements of this

of shares of Class A common stock equal to 250 of the number of shares of Class A common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient
to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock; and (v) the average daily trading volume of the common stock
on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such Class A common stock is listed or traded during the ten (10) days
prior to such closing shall exceed 4 million. 

For
a period until the one-year anniversary of the later of (i) the date a registration statement registering the shares of Class
A common stock issuable upon conversion of all the shares of preferred stock is declared effective or (ii) the date the Company
has obtained stockholder approval approving this transaction, the investor has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase additional
shares of preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of 100 million upon the same terms and conditions as the purchases of
preferred stock under the PIPE SPA.

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 8, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses, which we refer to herein as our initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus on target businesses in and around the high technology, blockchain and other general business industries globally. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering IPO and the private placement of Private Units, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting our initial business combination. 

We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful. 

On October 24, 2022, the Company, NaturalShrimp
Incorporated, a Nevada corporation NaturalShrimp ), and Yotta Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, entered into a Merger Agreement (the NaturalShrimp Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which Yotta Merger Sub,
Inc. would merge with and into the NaturalShrimp (the NaturalShrimp Business Combination with the Target as the surviving
corporation of the NaturalShrimp Business Combination and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. By a letter dated August 10,
2023 (the Termination Letter ), the Company informed NaturalShrimp that it was terminating Merger Agreement. The termination
of the NaturalShrimp Merger Agreement was due to breaches by NaturalShrimp of its obligations thereunder including, but not limited to,
NaturalShrimp s obligation to share the costs associated with the extension of the deadline by which Yotta must complete an initial
business combination. Although the payments were to be shared equally, NaturalShrimp failed to provide its portion despite being notified
of its obligation to do so. NaturalShrimp has not responded to the Termination Letter but previously sent a notification that it was
terminating the NaturalShrimp Merger Agreement and demanding the payment of a break-up fee. Yotta rejected that purported termination
as it does not believe NaturalShrimp has a legal basis under the NaturalShrimp Merger Agreement to terminate it. Moreover, pursuant to
Section 10.2(b) of the Merger Agreement, NaturalShrimp was not authorized to terminate the NaturalShrimp Merger Agreement when
it was in breach of its terms. The Company also included in the Termination Letter a demand for the 3 million termination fee due
to it under the terms of the NaturalShrimp Merger Agreement.

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare, and consummate, for the IPO and an initial Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenue until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. 

We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we had a net income of 73,893, which consisted of interest income of 93,855 and other income of 400,000, offset by general and administrative
expenses of 244,723, franchise tax expense of 7,900, income tax expense of 167,339. For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
we had a net income of 866,518, which consisted of interest income of 562,199, and other income of 635,100, offset by general and
administrative expenses of 297,823, franchise tax of (26,137), income tax expense of 59,095. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had a net income of 265,749, which consisted of interest income of 300,329 and other income of 710,899, offset by general and administrative
expenses of 510,336, franchise tax expense of 28,843, and income tax expense of 206,300. For the nine months ended September 30,
2023, we had a net income of 1,176,792, which consisted of interest income of 2,607,489, and other income of 635,100, offset by general
and administrative expenses of 1,548,552, franchise tax expense of 43,200, income tax expense of 474,045. 

Liquidity and Going Concern 

On April 22, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units (which does not include the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in the IPO) at an offering price of 10.00 per unit (the Public Units ), generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000. Simultaneously with the IPO, the Company sold to its Sponsor 313,500 units at 10.00 per unit (the Private Units in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of 3,135,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the private warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. 

We granted the underwriters in the IPO a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On April 27, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the Over-Allotment Units ), at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 15,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the over-allotment Units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional aggregate of 30,000 Private Units with the Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of 300,000. 

26 

Following the IPO and the private placement (including the Over-Allotment Units and the Over-Allotment Private Units), a total of 115,000,000 was placed in a trust account located in the United States established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders (the Trust Account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company as a trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 5,300,199. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. We did not withdraw interest earned on the Trust Account to pay our taxes during the three months period. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a Business Combination, the remaining funds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of
 404,404 outside the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of (3,978,534). On September 22, 2023, the Company s stockholders
approved an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to permit an extension to as late as August 22,
2024 without depositing any additional funds to the trust account. On each of April 21, 2023, May 19, 2023, June 20, 2023,
July 21, 2023 and August 21, 2023, the Company made a deposit of 120,000 to the Trust Account and extended the time to complete
a Business Combination to September 22, 2023. On September 22, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the
Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to permit an extension to August 22, 2024 without depositing any additional
funds to the Trust Account. On August 22, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s amended
and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from August
22, 2024 to October 22, 2025 on a monthly basis by depositing 18,564.20 per month into the Trust Account. It is uncertain that the Company
will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the extended date (or October 22, 2025 if the Sponsor elects to extend the
consummation deadline). Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or
because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon consummation of its Business Combination, in which
case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. If a Business Combination
is not consummated by October 22, 2025, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. 

The Company expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon consummation of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete its Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available, it will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following the Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, the Company may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet its obligations. 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by October 22, 2025, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for liquidation and subsequent dissolution as well as liquidity concerns raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non- financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

Business Combination Marketing Agreement 

The Company engaged EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. EarlyBirdCapital pursuant to a Finder s Engagement Agreement dated November 2, 2023, to assist Yotta with introductions to potential target
businesses in connection to its initial business combination. Yotta agreed to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee equal to one percent (1 of
the total consideration, (the total value of all cash, securities or other property paid at the closing or closings) of a transaction
between Yotta and a target business. 

Non-Redemption Agreements 

On September 19-21, 2023, the Company and its Sponsor entered into agreements Non-Redemption Agreements with several third parties in exchange for them agreeing not to redeem shares of the Company s common stock sold in its IPO Non-Redeemed Shares at the September Special Meeting at which a proposal to approve an extension of time for the Company to complete its initial business combination by August 22, 2024. In exchange for the foregoing commitments not to redeem such Non-Redeemed Shares, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to such third parties an aggregate of 299,340 shares of the Common Stock held by the Sponsor. The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of the 299,340 Non-Redeemed Shares to be 446,735 or on average 1.49 per share. The excess of the fair value of the Non-Redeemed Shares was determined to be a contribution to the Company from the Sponsor in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB Topic 5T and an offering cost in accordance with SAB Topic 5A. Accordingly, the offering cost was recorded against additional paid-in capital. 

Administrative Services Agreement 

We intend to enter into an agreement, commencing on April 19, 2022 through the earlier of our consummation of a Business Combination and our liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support. However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, the Sponsor agreed to defer the payment of such monthly fee. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination. 

Underwriting Agreement 

Upon closing of a Business Combination, the underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.0 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 2,300,000. In addition, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 4,025,000 which will be paid from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination s Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Right of First Refusal 

We granted Chardan for a period of 18 months after the date of the consummation of the Company s Business Combination, a right of first refusal to act as book-running manager, with at least 30 of the economics, or, in the case of a three-handed deal 20 of the economics, for any and all future public and private equity and debt offerings. 

28 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates; we have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption 

We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of shares of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero. 

Warrants 

We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own common shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. We determined that upon further review of the proposed form of warrant agreement, management concluded that the Public Warrants and Private Warrants to be issued pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment. 

Net (Loss) Income Per Share 

We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. As the Public Shares are considered to be redeemable at fair value, and a redemption at fair value does not amount to a distribution different than other stockholders, redeemable and non-redeemable common stock are presented as one class of stock in calculating net income per share. The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the IPO and private placement to purchase an aggregate of 11,843,500 shares in the calculation of diluted income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. We then allocated the net income ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable shares. 

29 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 mostly requires, on an annual basis, disclosure of specific categories in an entity s effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The incremental disclosures may be presented on a prospective or retrospective basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2023-09 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statement. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which were previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, are not yet remediated. Management continues to devote significant planning and execution efforts toward remediation these material weaknesses: 

We lack sufficient segregation of duties with respect to our record keeping, asset custody and authorization controls. 

We lack controls to prevent unauthorized access to our general ledger including the ability to record journal entries including the ability to record and/or modify journal entries. 

We lack controls to identify and account for certain complex non-routine transactions. 

The design of our controls over the approval of related party transactions is ineffective including requirements to provide contemporaneous documentation of the business purpose and validity of travel expenses. 

The design of our controls over the preparation of the tax provision, tax accrual and franchise tax accrual as well as related disbursements from the trust account and subsequent timely payment of tax estimates are ineffective. 

Our controls over the preparation of expense accruals including our ability differentiating between contractual and contingent liabilities and to detect errors in expense accruals through our financial close process are ineffective. 

We have ineffective oversight on the part of our audit committee. 

30 

Remediation Plan for the Material Weaknesses 

As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management has identified material weaknesses as of that date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To remediate the material weaknesses identified above, we are initiating controls and procedures in order to: 

educating control owners about the principles and requirements of each control, particularly those that have an impact on financial reporting, which includes a specific emphasis on improving the transaction approval process; 

developing and maintaining documentation to facilitate knowledge transfer during personnel and function changes, in addition designating a specific individual for the purpose of document retention; 

developing a protocol for each control, as well as establishing reviews for specific tasks and transactions; and 

Enhancing communication between management and the board as well as management and the audit committee. 

The material weaknesses identified above will not be considered remediated until our remediation efforts have been fully implemented and we have concluded that these controls are operating effectively. 

Management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Other than the changes intended to remediate the material weakness as discussed above and in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Factors that could cause our actual results to
differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our final prospectus for our IPO filed with the
SEC on April 21, 2022. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in
our final prospectus for our IPO filed with the SEC on April 21, 2022. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional
factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

On April 22, 2022, we consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 Units, each Unit consisting of one share of common stock, one redeemable warrant and one right, for 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination. We had granted the underwriters in the IPO a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments. 

On April 25, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 1,500,000 Units at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit for an aggregate purchase price of 15,000,000 on April 27, 2022. The securities in the IPO, including the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option, were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-263415). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on April 19, 2022. 

On April 22, 2022, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we sold an aggregate of 313,500 Private Units in a private placement with the Sponsor, at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds of 3,135,000. The Private Units are identical to the units sold in the IPO, except that (a) the Private Units and underlying securities will not be transferable, assignable or salable until the consummation of our initial business combination, except to permitted transferees, and (b) the private warrants, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, (i) will not be redeemable by us, (ii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis, and (iii) will be entitled to registration rights. 

On April 27, 2022, simultaneously with the closing of the exercise of the over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of an additional aggregate of 30,000 Private Units in a private placement to the Sponsor, at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds of 300,000. The Private Units were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

A total of 115,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of the Units in the IPO and the private placement of the Private Units on April 22, 2022 and April 27, 2022 were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. 

For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our IPO, see Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report. 

32 

On September 22, 2023, the
Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the September Special Meeting ). During the September Special Meeting, stockholders
approved (i) an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and (ii) an amendment to the Company s
Trust Agreement as amended on April 19, 2023. In connection with the stockholders vote at the September Special Meeting, an
aggregate of 3,358,759 shares with redemption value of approximately 35,797,997 (or 10.66 per share) of the Company s common stock
were tendered for redemption. 

On August 22, 2024, the Company held a special
meeting of stockholders (the August Special Meeting ). During the August Special Meeting, stockholders approved an amendment
to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a
business combination from August 22, 2024 to October 22, 2025 on a monthly basis by depositing an amount equal to 0.04 multiplied
by the number of shares of common stock sold to the public in the IPO and that remain outstanding after giving effect to the shares that
were redeemed in connection with the August Special Meeting. In connection with the stockholders vote at the August Special Meeting,
an aggregate of 262,231 shares with redemption value of approximately 2,956,393.95 (or 11.27 per share) of the Company s
common stock were tendered for redemption. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
