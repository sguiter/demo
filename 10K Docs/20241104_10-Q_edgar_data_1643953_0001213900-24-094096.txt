million. Included in this amount was million for the fair value of contingent consideration
related to million shares of Class A common stock issuable to Intellibed security holders if the closing price of the Company s
stock did not equal or exceed certain thresholds during the period beginning on the six-month anniversary of the closing date and ending
on the 18-month anniversary of the closing date. The contingent shares were valued using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. Because the
contingent consideration was payable with a fixed number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock, it was classified as
equity and did not require remeasurement in subsequent periods. During March 2024, the Company issued million shares of Class A common
stock to Intellibed security holders since the Company s stock price did not meet any of the indicated thresholds during the contingency
period.

 These charges include certain estimates that are provisional and include management judgments and assumptions that could change materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could result in additional restructuring, impairment or other related charges not reflected above. 

Restructuring actions result
in various costs, including employee-related costs, accelerated depreciation expense, write-downs of long-lived assets and inventory,
impairment of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, contract termination costs and other associated costs. Employee-related costs represent
one-time termination benefits for severance and other post-employment costs that are recognized as incurred upon communication of the
plan to the identified employees. Accelerated depreciation expense represents additional expense resulting from shortening the useful
lives of production and other assets to coincide with the end of production and other activities under an approved restructuring plan.
Costs to terminate contracts are recognized upon entering a termination agreement with the provider. Other associated restructuring costs
are expensed as incurred. Any impairment or write-down of assets resulting from restructuring activities are recognized immediately in
the period the plan is approved. 

Impairment of assets included
impairment charges associated with entering into a sublease for the Salt Lake City, Utah manufacturing facility to be closed and related
impairment charges associated with certain leasehold improvements of the property. The fair values of the impaired assets were determined
by the Company to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy (see Note 5 Fair Value Measurements for the definition
of Level 3 inputs) and were estimated based on internal expertise related to current marketplace conditions and estimated future
discounted cash flows. These assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values at the time of impairment. If estimated fair values subsequently
decline, the carrying values of the assets will be adjusted accordingly.

million indefinite-lived intangible asset. The Restructuring Plan was determined to be a triggering
event for potential impairment of this indefinite-lived intangible asset. As a result of the impairment assessment performed, the Company
determined the asset was impaired and recorded an impairment charge to write off the entire million balance. 

The lease for the Company s
Grantsville, Utah manufacturing facility included a five-year renewal option that was reasonably certain of being exercised and included
in the lease term when the right-of-use ROU asset and lease liability were originally measured. Because of the expected closure of this facility as part of the Restructuring
Plan, the renewal option was no longer deemed reasonably certain of being exercised and a reassessment of the lease terms was completed.
As a result, the original lease term was shortened and the Company recorded a million reduction to the ROU asset and corresponding
lease liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, using the applicable discount rate at the effective date of the reassessment.

million. 

The
warrant liabilities (see Note 12 Warrant Liabilities for more information) are Level 3 instruments and use internal models
to estimate fair value using certain significant unobservable inputs which require determination of relevant inputs and assumptions.
Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Such inputs include risk free interest
rate, expected average life, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility. These Level 3 liabilities generally decrease (increase)
in value based upon an increase (decrease) in risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield. Conversely, the fair value of these
Level 3 liabilities generally increase (decrease) in value if the expected average life or expected volatility were to increase
(decrease).

Credit Agreement 

On January 23, 2024, Purple
LLC, Purple Inc. and Intellibed (collectively, the Loan Parties entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the
 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ), which amended and restated the then existing term loan agreement Term Loan
Agreement ), with Coliseum Capital Partners CCP and other lenders (collectively, the Lenders and
Delaware Trust Company, as administrative agent. The Lenders agreed to assume the Loan Parties obligations under the Term Loan
Agreement and refinance their existing obligations. A term loan in the amount of million (the Related Party Loan was funded by the Lenders that repaid in full the million of term loans outstanding, repaid in full the million of asset based
lending loans outstanding, paid fees, premiums and expenses incurred in connection with this transaction, and provided net proceeds to
the Company (after payments of outstanding debt, unpaid accrued interest and expenses) equal to approximately million. Interest
on the Related Party Loan is payable each month and the principal outstanding matures and is due on December 31, 2026. The Company has
elected for interest to be capitalized and added to the principal amount of the loan. The Related Party Loan bears interest at a rate
equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus , with a floor of
 per annum, plus (ii) per annum (or, if Purple LLC elects to pay interest in kind to reduce it cash obligations, per
annum). Any prepayments of principal on or after August 7, 2024 but before August 7, 2025 are subject to a prepayment penalty of ,
and any prepayments of principal on or after August 7, 2025 are subject to a prepayment penalty of . The Loan Parties may request
an additional term loan from the Lenders in an aggregate amount not to exceed million on terms requested by them to the extent agreed
to by the Lenders at their discretion. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also removed restrictions and requirements typically
associated with an asset-based loan. 

In
connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company issued million warrants to the Lenders (see Note 12 
 Warrant Liabilities and incurred fees and expenses of million that were recorded as debt issuance costs in the first quarter
of 2024. Interest expense under the Related Party Loan was million and million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively. 

The
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement granted a security interest to the Lenders in substantially all of the assets (subject to certain
limited exceptions) of the Loan Parties to secure the Loan Parties loans and other obligations under the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, including a security interest in the intellectual property owned by the Loan Parties. 

The
Loan Parties (other than Purple LLC) provided an unconditional guaranty of the payment of all obligations and liabilities of Purple LLC
under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 

The
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides for standard indemnification of the Lenders and contains representations, warranties
and certain covenants of the Loan Parties. While any amounts are outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Loan
Parties are subject to a number of affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants regarding dispositions of property, investments,
forming or acquiring subsidiaries, business combinations or acquisitions, incurrence of additional indebtedness and transactions with
affiliates, among other customary covenants. The Loan Parties are also restricted from paying dividends or making other distributions
or payments on their capital stock, subject to limited exceptions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants
under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

million that were recorded as debt issuance costs in the third quarter of 2023. 

The Term Loan Agreement provided
for up to million of term loans, with up to million of incremental term loans available, subject to certain conditions (collectively,
the Term Loans ). Proceeds from the Term Loans were used for general corporate purposes. The borrowing rates under the Term
Loan Agreement were based on SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of per annum, plus per annum, with a SOFR floor of 
per annum. The Term Loans were to be repaid at the earlier of (i) a three-year amortization schedule ending on August 7, 2026 or (ii)
the payment in full of the ABL Agreement. The Term Loans could be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, but subject to a prepayment
premium. There were also potential mandatory prepayment obligations based on certain asset dispositions, casualty events and extraordinary
receipts. Once repaid, no portion of the Term Loans could be reborrowed. 

The ABL Agreement provided
for up to million of revolving loans subject to a borrowing base calculation and minimum availability requirements (with sub-facilities
for swing line loans and the issuance of letters of credit), with incremental increases available up to million (the ABL
Loans ), subject to certain conditions, availability reserves, minimum availability requirements, borrowing base calculations, and
restrictive covenants. In October 2023, the ABL Lenders implemented an availability reserve of million, which reduced the amount
available under the borrowing base. Outstanding principal and accrued interest on the ABL Loans were to be repaid on August 7, 2026. 

Term loans totaling 
million were fully drawn at closing and, subsequent to the closing in August 2023, the Company executed million in ABL loan draws
and then repaid million of those borrowings prior to the end of 2023. The outstanding balance of ABL Loans totaled million
at December 31, 2023. In connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, all obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreements were
paid in full and the agreements were terminated. The termination was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and million of unamortized
debt issuance costs related to the 2023 Credit Agreements were recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2024.
Interest expense under the 2023 Credit Agreements was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months
ended September 30, 2024, there was no interest expense associated with the 2023 Credit Agreements. 

2020 Credit Agreement 

On September 3, 2020, Purple
LLC entered into a financing arrangement with a group of financial institutions (the 2020 Credit Agreement ). The 2020 Credit
Agreement provided for a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit. The term loan was to be repaid in accordance
with a five-year amortization schedule or prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement
of certain costs. The revolving credit facility had a term of five years and carried the same interest provisions as the term debt. A
commitment fee was due quarterly based on the applicable margin applied to the unused total revolving commitment. In connection with the
Company s execution of the 2023 Credit Agreements, the Company terminated its 2020 Credit Agreement. The Company had no outstanding
borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement at the time of termination. 

On February 17, 2023, the
Company entered into a fifth amendment to the 2020 Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, revised various covenants associated
with the 2020 Credit Agreement. As a condition of entering into the amendment, the Company repaid the million outstanding balance

as debt issuance costs in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The amendment was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and 
million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loan were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter
of 2023.

million warrants to the Lenders (the Warrants ).
Each Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase share of the Company s Class A common stock at a price of per
share, subject to adjustment. The Warrants will expire on the -year anniversary of issuance, or earlier upon redemption. The holders
do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A common stock or any voting rights until they exercise their Warrants. After
the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of the Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share
of Class A common stock held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally. A holder of the Warrants will not have the right
to exercise its Warrants, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially
own in excess of of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The Warrants
contain a repurchase provision which, upon an occurrence of a fundamental transaction as defined in the warrant agreement, could give
rise to an obligation of the Company to pay cash to the warrant holders. In addition, other provisions may lead to a reduction in the
exercise price of the Warrants. The Company determined the fundamental transaction provisions require the Warrants to be accounted for
as a liability at fair value on the date of the transaction, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change.
As a result, the liability for these Warrants was recorded at fair value on the date of issuance with the offset included in debt issuance
costs. This liability is subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date or exercise date with changes in the fair value
included in earnings. 

The Company used a Monte Carlo
Simulation model to determine the fair value of the liability associated with the Warrants. The model used key assumptions and inputs,
such as exercise price, fair market value of common stock, risk free interest rate, warrant life, expected volatility and the probability
of a warrant re-price event.

Warrant life in years

The Warrants had a fair value
of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company recognized a gain of million in its condensed consolidated statement of operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to a decrease in the fair value of the Warrants outstanding at the end of the period
compared to the fair value of the Warrants outstanding at the end of the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company recognized a loss of million in its condensed consolidated statement of operations related to an increase in the
fair value of the Warrants outstanding at the end of the period compared to the fair value of the Warrants on the date of issuance.

expense of million in its condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to
this future bonus payment. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a compensation expense reduction of

in the Company s Long-Term Incentive Plan. The incentive award payment is based on a performance goal of the volume weighted average
price per share of the Company s Class A common stock on NASDAQ on March 31, 2027. The Company determined the provisions surrounding
the performance cash long-term incentive award require it to be accounted for as a liability at fair value at each reporting period, with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change. The Company recorded a de minimis amount of compensation expense
in the consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to this future award payment.

be dismissed in full, with prejudice. The Court entered a final judgment dismissing the case in January 2024. The plaintiffs have filed
an appeal to the Utah Court of Appeals. The Company maintains insurance to cover the costs of defending against claims of this nature
and intends to continue to vigorously defend against these claims in the course of the plaintiffs appeal. 

On April 3, 2023, Purple s
founders filed a complaint against Purple LLC in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleges that Purple LLC breached the limited
liability company agreement of Purple LLC by failing to pay the full amount of tax distributions owed under the agreement. The plaintiffs
seek damages of approximately million in allegedly unpaid tax distributions as well as legal fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the litigation. On June 13, 2023, Purple LLC filed an answer to the complaint denying the plaintiffs allegations, setting
forth its affirmative defenses, and requesting dismissal of all claims and entry of judgment in Purple LLC s favor. The outcome
of the litigation cannot be predicted at this early stage in the proceedings. Purple LLC denies all allegations and intends to vigorously
defend against these claims. 

On January 17, 2024, two customers
filed a punitive class action lawsuit (the Class Action Lawsuit against Purple LLC in California Superior Court in the
County of San Francisco alleging unlawful marketing and pricing practices, fraud and unjust enrichment. The suit sought damages and other
relief on behalf of all persons who purchased Purple LLC products during the applicable statutory periods in California. On July 15, 2024,
the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement with the plaintiffs in connection with the Class
Action Lawsuit. On August 16, 2024 the United States District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the Class Action
Lawsuit and approved the Settlement Agreement. Upon receipt of the executed release of all claims by the plaintiffs, the Company made
a cash payment pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. 

On April 16, 2024, Purple s
founders, in their capacity as a former landlord of Purple LLC, brought a lawsuit against Purple LLC, as lessee, for amounts allegedly
owed under a real estate lease which the parties terminated effective September 30, 2023. In the suit, the plaintiffs allege approximately
 million in damages, based primarily on a dispute regarding whether Purple LLC left the premises in the condition required by the
lease. The plaintiffs further claim approximately million in holdover rent, as well as unspecified amounts in interest, late fees,
liquidated damages, attorney fees and costs. Purple LLC denies all allegations and intends to vigorously defend against these claims. 

On July 24, 2024, a former

authorized to provide for the issuance of shares of the preferred stock in one or more series and to establish from time to time the number
of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the voting rights, designations and other special rights or restrictions. At September

NOL Rights Plan 

On June 27, 2024, the Board
adopted, and the Company entered into the NOL Rights Plan, which is designed to preserve approximately million of the Company s
Current NOLs under Section 382 of the of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Code Section 382 ). At the Special
Meeting, the Company s stockholders ratified the NOL Rights Plan. The Company s ability to use the Current NOLs to offset
future taxable income may be significantly limited if the Company experiences an ownership change under Code Section 382,
which occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders that is deemed to own at least of the Company s common stock
increases their aggregate ownership by more than percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year
period. The NOL Rights Plan is intended to prevent an ownership change by acting as a deterrent to any Person (as such term is defined
in the NOL Rights Plan) acquiring or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company (or, in the case of a Grandfathered Person
(as such term is defined in the NOL Rights Plan), an additional one-half of one percentage point of the outstanding common Stock of the
Company above their current ownership percentage). Any Person that acquires shares of the Company s common Stock in violation of
the limitations of the NOL Rights Plan is known as an Acquiring Person. For purposes of the NOL Rights Plan, common
stock includes (i) the Class A common stock; (ii) the Class B common stock; and (iii) any interest that would be treated as stock 
of the Company pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.382-2T(f)(18). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the NOL Rights Plan allows for the
exercise of currently outstanding conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, without triggering the NOL Rights
Plan. See Note 12 Warrant Liabilities for further discussion of the Company s outstanding warrants. 

The NOL Rights Plan provided
for the issuance of a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right for each share of common stock outstanding
on July 26, 2024. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Preferred Share
for a purchase price of , subject to adjustment as provided in the NOL Rights Plan. Each Series C Preferred Share is designed to
be the economic equivalent of one share of common stock. 

Unless the Board determines
to effect an exchange (as discussed below), each Right will become exercisable on the Distribution Time , which is the earlier
to occur of (i) the tenth day following a public announcement, or the public disclosure of facts indicating, that a Person has become
an Acquiring Person or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board prior to such time
as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would
result in a Person becoming an Acquiring Person. After the Distribution Time, any Rights held by an Acquiring Person will be void and
will not be exercisable. As a result, any Acquiring Person will be subject to significant dilution upon the occurrence of the Distribution
Time. At any time after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, but before such Acquiring Person holds more than of the common stock,
the Board, in its sole discretion, may instead extinguish the Rights by exchanging share of Class A common stock for each Right, other
than Rights held by the Acquiring Person. 

The Rights will expire on
the earliest to occur of (i) the close of business on June 30, 2025; (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed (as discussed below)
or exchanged by the Company; (iii) the repeal of Code Section 382, if the Board determines that the NOL Rights Plan is no longer necessary
for the preservation of the Current NOLs; or (v) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which the Board determines that no
Current NOLs may be carried forward. At any time prior to the expiration of the NOL Rights Plan, the Company may redeem the Rights in
whole, but not in part, at a price of per Right (subject to adjustment and payable in cash, Class A common stock or other consideration
deemed appropriate by the Board). Immediately upon the action of the Board authorizing any redemption or at a later time as the Board
may establish for the effectiveness of the redemption, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to
receive the redemption price. 

The initial issuance of the Rights as a dividend had no tax, financial
accounting or reporting impact. The fair value of the Rights is nominal, since the Rights were not exercisable when issued and no value
is attributable to them. Additionally, the Rights do not meet the definition of a liability under GAAP and therefore are not being accounted
for as a long-term obligation. Accordingly, unless the Rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of the Distribution Time as discussed
above, the NOL Rights Plan and the Rights issued thereunder have no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company (or, in the
case of a Person already holding more than of the outstanding common stock of the Company as of the date of the NOL Protective Charter
Amendment, one-half of one percentage point of the outstanding common stock of the Company above their current ownership percentage).
At the Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the NOL Protective Charter Amendment. 

Any acquisition of common
stock in violation of the NOL Protective Charter Amendment will be void as of the date it is attempted. Upon the Company s written
demand, the purported acquiring stockholder must transfer the excess acquired common stock to the Company s transfer agent (along
with any dividends or other distributions paid with respect to such excess acquired common stock). The Company s transfer agent
is then required to sell such excess acquired common stock in an arm s-length transaction (or series of transactions) that would
not constitute a violation under the NOL Protective Charter Amendment. The net proceeds of the sale together with any other distributions
with respect to such excess acquired common stock received by the Company s transfer agent, after deduction of all costs incurred
by the transfer agent, will be transferred first to the purported transferee in an amount, if any, up to the cost (or in the case of gift,
inheritance or similar transfer, the fair market value of the excess securities on the date of the prohibited transfer) incurred by the
purported transferee to acquire such excess securities, and the balance of the proceeds, if any, will be transferred to a charitable beneficiary.
Further, the Company may hold any stockholder liable, to the fullest extent of the law, for any intentional violation of the NOL Protective
Charter Amendment. 

Warrants 

In connection with the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company issued million Warrants to the Lenders. Each Warrant entitles the registered holder to
purchase one share of the Company s Class A common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. While the Warrants
are exercisable, the Company may call the Warrants for redemption in whole and not in part at any time at a price of per share of
Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants upon not less than 45 days prior written notice of redemption to each
holder, provided that this redemption right is only available if the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds
 per share on each of trading days within a -trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice
of redemption to the holders. A holder of the Warrants will not have the right to exercise its Warrants, to the extent that after giving
effect to such exercise, the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of of the shares of Class A
common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. 

Sponsor Warrants 

There were million sponsor
warrants issued pursuant to a private placement simultaneously with the Company s initial public offering. Unexercised sponsor warrants
totaling million expired in February 2023 and were cancelled pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement. These sponsor warrants
had no fair value on the date of expiration. 

Noncontrolling Interest 

Noncontrolling interest NCI is the membership interest in Purple LLC held by holders other than the Company. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the combined
NCI percentage in Purple LLC was and , respectively. The Company has consolidated the financial position and results of operations

million on a pretax loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
as compared to various state taxes of million on a pretax loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This
resulted in an effective tax rate of ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to ) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the statutory federal
rate of primarily due to the impact of the full valuation allowance recorded against the Company s deferred tax assets at September
30, 2024. 

In connection with the Business
Combination, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement with InnoHold, which provides for the payment by the Company to InnoHold
of of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the Company actually realizes (or is deemed to
realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the Closing as a result of (i) any tax basis increases in the assets of Purple LLC
resulting from the distribution to InnoHold of the cash consideration, (ii) the tax basis increases in the assets of Purple LLC resulting
from the redemption by Purple LLC or the exchange by the Company, as applicable, of Class B Paired Securities or cash, as applicable,
and (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by the Company as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, payments it makes under
the agreement. 

As noncontrolling interest
holders exercise their right to exchange or cause Purple LLC to redeem all or a portion of their Class B Units, a tax receivable agreement
liability may be recorded based on of the estimated future cash tax savings that the Company may realize as a result of increases
in the basis of the assets of Purple LLC attributed to the Company as a result of such exchange or redemption. The amount of the increase
in asset basis, the related estimated cash tax savings and the attendant liability to be recorded will depend on the price of the Company s
Class A common stock at the time of the relevant redemption or exchange. 

The effects of uncertain tax
positions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements if these positions meet a more-likely-than-not threshold.
For those uncertain tax positions that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements, liabilities are established to reflect
the portion of those positions it cannot conclude more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company s
policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties would be included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated
balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of million.

the approval of any other member. At September 30, 2024, Purple Inc. had a 99.8 economic ownership interest in Purple LLC while Class
B unit holders had the remaining 0.2 . 

Recent Developments in Our Business 

Restructuring Activities 

In August 2024, we initiated the Restructuring Plan to strategically
realign our operational focus to achieve operations efficiencies that are expected to improve profitability and provide for reinvesting
in technology and marketing initiatives. The Restructuring Plan is comprised of the permanent closure of both Utah manufacturing facilities
to consolidate mattress production in our Georgia plant, and a headcount reduction at our Utah headquarters to drive additional operating
efficiencies. Closure of the two Utah manufacturing facilities is projected to be completed during the first quarter of 2025 while consolidation
into the Georgia facility is expected to be finalized by December 31, 2024. The reduction in workforce at the Utah headquarters was completed
in August 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized 32.7 million of restructuring, impairment and other related charges,
which included 3.6 million of employee-related and other costs, 9.0 million of accelerated depreciation, 9.1 million related to write-downs
of inventory and long-lived assets to be disposed of or equipment in progress that will not be put in service, and 11.0 million of impairment
charges associated with entering into a sublease for one of the Utah manufacturing facilities to be closed and impairment of an intangible
asset. We expect to record additional restructuring and other related charges in the amount of 9.9 million through the second quarter
of 2025. These charges include certain estimates that are provisional and include management judgments and assumptions that could change
materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could
result in additional restructuring, impairment or other related charges not reflected. 

Operational Developments 

In May 2023, we launched our
new Premium and Luxe product lineups. This launch was supported by enhancements to our in-store presence and refinements to our marketing
programs and brand messaging. The response to our new products and enhanced brand positioning was extremely positive. As consumer spending
habits have moved away from the COVID era e-commerce spike to brick and mortar buying, we have grown the number of Purple showrooms to
59 as of September 30, 2024. We have also focused on growing our placements with wholesale partners and improving wholesale door productivity.
Improving the sales productivity of both our wholesale partners and existing showrooms remains a significant priority and critical component
of our strategy to respond to shifting demand patterns. In addition, we are diligently working to improve e-commerce conversion by determining
ways to best optimize traffic on our website. Furthermore, we are concentrating efforts on driving gross margin improvement through various
methods such as selective pricing actions, continued mix shift towards our Premium and Luxe collections, and manufacturing and supply
chain optimization. With the introduction of our new product lineups, we initiated a new marketing campaign which included enhanced brand
positioning and increased media investment at the top of the acquisition funnel. During 2024, we have been realizing efficiencies with
our media investments by targeting specific segments most likely to purchase Purple and by focusing more effort on those consumers currently
in the market for a sleep product. Moreover, we have improved gross margin in the second and third quarters of 2024 by driving cost savings
through supply chain initiatives and manufacturing efficiency. We have delivered direct material cost savings from our supplier diversification
efforts, improved scrap and yield results from continuous improvements, and our outbound freight costs are reflecting cost improvements
along with improved delivery reliability. We believe consolidation of our manufacturing footprint pursuant to our Restructuring Plan is
an important step to advance our grid innovation and build momentum to achieve positive operating cash flow and market share growth over
the long term. 

Debt Financing 

On January 23, 2024, we entered
into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the Term Loan Agreement, with the Lenders. The Lenders agreed
to assume our obligations under the Term Loan Agreement and agreed to refinance our existing obligations. Pursuant to the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, we borrowed 61.0 million from the Lenders that was used to repay the 25.0 million of Term Loans outstanding,
the 5.0 million of ABL Loans outstanding, loan fees, premiums and expenses incurred in connection with this transaction and provided
net proceeds to us (after payments of outstanding debt, unpaid accrued interest, and expenses) of approximately 27.0 million. Interest
on the new loan is payable each month and the principal outstanding matures and is due on December 31, 2026. To reduce cash obligations,
we have elected for interest to be capitalized and added to the principal amount. The loan bears interest at a rate equal to (i) the secured
overnight financing rate plus 0.10 , with a floor of 3.5 per annum, plus (ii) 8.25 per annum (or, because Purple LLC has elected to
pay interest in kind to reduce its cash obligations, 10.25 per annum). Any prepayments of principal on or after August 7, 2024 but before
August 7, 2025 are subject to a prepayment penalty of 1.25 , and any prepayments of principal on or after August 7, 2025 are subject to
a prepayment penalty of 2.50 . We may request an additional term loan from the Lenders in an aggregate amount not to exceed 19.0 million
on terms requested by us to the extent agreed to by the Lenders at their discretion. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also removed
restrictions and requirements typically associated with an asset-based loan. In connection with our execution of the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, all obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreements were paid in full and the 2023 Agreements were terminated. 

26 

Warrants 

In connection with the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, we issued Warrants to the Lenders to purchase 20.0 million shares of our Class A common stock. Each Warrant
entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of 1.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
The Warrants will expire on the 10-year anniversary of issuance, or earlier upon redemption. A holder of the Warrants will not have the
right to exercise them, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially
own in excess of 49.9 of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The Warrants
contain certain provisions that do not meet the criteria for equity classification and therefore were recorded as liabilities. The liability
for these Warrants was recorded at a fair value of 19.6 million on the date of issuance with the offset included in debt issuance costs.
This liability is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date or exercise date with changes in the fair value included in earnings.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss of 0.1 million in our condensed consolidated statement of operations
related to an increase in the fair value of the Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024. 

Registration Rights Agreement 

In connection with the issuance
of the Warrants, we entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with the Holders, providing for the registration of Registrable Securities,
subject to customary terms and conditions. We are responsible for the payment of the Holders expenses in connection with any offering
or sale of Registrable Securities by the Holders, including underwriting discounts or selling commissions, placement agent or broker fees
or similar discounts, commissions or fees relating to the sale of certain Registrable Securities. The registration statement filed by
the Company on March 21, 2024 to register the Registrable Securities became effective on June 4, 2024. 

NOL Rights Plan 

On June 27, 2024, our Board
approved the adoption of the NOL Rights Plan with a stated expiration date of June 30, 2025. The Board approved the NOL Rights Plan to
protect stockholder value by attempting to safeguard our ability to use Current NOLs of approximately 238 million to reduce potential
future federal income tax obligations from becoming substantially limited by future ownership of our Common Stock. Upon adopting the NOL
Rights Plan, 0.3 million shares of our authorized shares of preferred stock were designated as Series C Preferred Shares. Pursuant to
the NOL Rights Plan, the Board authorized and declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders
of record at the close of business on July 26, 2024. Upon a stockholder acquiring greater than a 4.9 ownership percentage threshold (or,
if a stockholder has beneficial ownership of in excess of 4.9 , then the ownership percentage that is one-half of one percentage point
greater than their current beneficial ownership percentage), the Rights will become exercisable to significantly dilute any stockholder
who violates the ownership limitations of the NOL Rights Plan. The NOL Rights Plan was ratified by the Company s stockholders at
the Special Meeting. 

NOL Protective Charter Amendment 

In connection with the NOL
Rights Plan, the Board adopted, and recommended that our stockholders approve, the NOL Protective Charter Amendment that adds an additional
layer of protection to our Current NOLs until June 30, 2025 by voiding any transfer of Common Stock that results in a stockholder acquiring
beyond a 4.9 ownership percentage threshold (or, if a stockholder has current beneficial ownership of in excess of 4.9 , then the ownership
percentage that is one-half of one percentage point greater than their current beneficial ownership percentage). The NOL Protective Charter
Amendment was approved by the Company s stockholders at the Special Meeting. 

Executive Summary Results of Operations 

Net revenues decreased 21.4
million, or 15.3 , to 118.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 140.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The drop in revenue was primarily driven by industry-wide demand softness for home-related products in addition to
a reduction in advertising spend. From a sales channel perspective, DTC net revenues decreased 9.4 million, or 11.7 , and wholesale net
revenues decreased 12.0 million, or 20.1 . Within DTC, e-commerce net revenues decreased 9.3 million, or 15.7 , while Purple showroom
net revenues were flat. The decrease in wholesale channel net revenues also reflected our decision to exit our relationship with certain
customers. 

27 

Gross profit decreased 12.1
million, or 25.6 , to 35.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47.3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to 12.9 million in restructuring related charges associated with the Restructuring Plan recognized
in cost of revenues and lower sales volume. These decreases were partially offset by increases in gross profit due to reduced costs that
were largely attributable to supply chain initiatives and operational efficiency improvements implemented over the last 12 months. We
also experienced increased costs in 2023 due to non-recurring costs associated with the transition to our new product lineup. Our gross
profit percentage, which decreased to 29.7 of net revenues in the third quarter of 2024 from 33.8 in the third quarter of 2023, was
negatively impacted by the restructuring related costs offset by the supply chain initiatives and manufacturing efficiencies previously
noted. We expect our Restructuring Plan will further streamline our operations and provide increased gross profits. 

 Operating expenses increased 2.1 million, or 2.6 to 82.0 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 79.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
driven by 19.8 million in restructuring related charges as part of the consolidation of our manufacturing operations to achieve operational
efficiencies. This increase was offset in part by a 9.1 million decrease in advertising spend and the benefit of a reduced prior period
comparison due to a 6.9 loss on impairment of goodwill recorded in the prior year third quarter. 

Other income totaled 7.6
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense of 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. Other income in 2024 included 7.3 million associated with proceeds received in July 2024 for the final settlement payment of a
previously filed business interruption insurance claim and a 4.8 million gain resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the Warrants
outstanding at September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by 4.4 million of non-cash interest expense related to the Related
Party Loan. In 2023, other expense was primarily due to a 3.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to a refinancing. 

 Net loss attributable to Purple
Inc. was 39.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 36.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The 3.2 million increase in net loss was primarily due to 32.7 million of restructuring, impairment and other related
charges associated with the Restructuring Plan, partially offset by a 17.7 million decrease in operating expenses, excluding the impact
of restructuring, impairment and other related charges, and a 11.1 million increase in other income. 

Outlook for Growth 

We believe, given our announced
cost actions, that we are well positioned to grow our business in this market, that remains challenged. We remain focused on five key
initiatives to drive sustainable and profitable market share gains: 

Drive gross
 margin improvements. We believe we can continue to drive gross margin improvements
 through various strategies that include selective pricing actions, continued mix shift towards
 our Premium and Luxe collections, supply chain optimization, and consolidation of our mattress
 manufacturing. We have generated strong efficiency gains in our plants and believe our Restructuring
 Plan will achieve further operational efficiencies. We have delivered direct material cost
 savings from our supplier diversification efforts, improved scrap and yield results from
 continuous improvements, and our outbound freight costs are reflecting cost improvements
 along with improved delivery reliability. 

Improve the productivity of our existing showroom and wholesale doors. In Purple showrooms, we are focusing on increasing productivity and profitability over door expansion. This includes establishing a more focused selling environment with new demand driven tactics, a new consumer financing partnership and store expense optimization. With our wholesale partners, we are continuing to focus on deepening our partnerships at each functional touch point, including joint business planning, collaborative marketing and sales associate training to maximize productivity and continued brand awareness. 

Drive e-commerce conversion. We intend to drive conversion improvements through personalization and streamlining of the website. Our efforts will focus on altering the website experience by visitor intent and product focus and simplifying the experience for potential customers. 

Improve
our marketing effectiveness. Our marketing will support growth in two ways by enhancing creative and by improving media
efficiency. Our premium branding has been performing well and we believe there is potential to further evolve the marketing
creative to attract more consumers to the brand. We will focus on media efficiency by directing spend based on geography and
high sales potential, adjusting the cadence of our spend to match consumer demand periods and shifting some of our upper funnel spend
closer to key wholesale distribution points. Additionally, we recently moved digital media management back in house to increase agility
and performance. 

Bring
new products and innovations to market. We continue to accelerate innovation, keeping our product and technology pipelines robust
and vibrant. Recent initiatives are generating new and more cost-effective technologies which positions us for the next stage
of growth. We expect multiple new product launches across each of our major product categories over the next 12 months as
we continue to drive our Path to Premium Sleep strategy with holistic, sleep system solutions. 

There is no guarantee that
we will be able to effectively continue to execute these initiatives, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that
are difficult to predict, including the risks described in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report and in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2024 and elsewhere herein. Therefore, actual
results may differ materially and adversely from those described above. In addition, we may, in the future, adapt these focuses in response
to changes in the market or our business.

Revenues, Net 

Net revenues decreased 21.4
million, or 15.3 , to 118.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 140.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by industry-wide demand softness for home-related products in addition to a reduction
in advertising spend. From a sales channel perspective, DTC net revenues decreased 9.4 million, or 11.7 , and wholesale net revenues
decreased 12.0 million, or 20.1 . Within DTC, e-commerce net revenues decreased 9.3 million, or 15.7 , while Purple showroom net revenues
were flat. The decrease in wholesale channel net revenues also reflected our decision to exit our relationship with certain customers. 

Total Cost of Revenues 

Total cost of revenues decreased 9.3 million, or 10.0 , to 83.4 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 92.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was
due primarily to reduced sales volumes coupled with lower production costs that were largely attributable to supply chain initiatives
and operational efficiency improvements implemented over the last 12 months. This decrease was offset in part by 12.9 million of restructuring
related charges associated with the Restructuring Plan. We also experienced non-recurring costs in 2023 associated with the transition
to our new product lineup. Our gross profit percentage, which decreased to 29.7 of net revenues in the third quarter of 2024 from 33.8 
in the third quarter of 2023, was negatively impacted by the 12.9 million of restructuring related charges offset in part by improved
production effectiveness due primarily to supply chain initiatives and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect the Restructuring Plan will
achieve further operational efficiencies and provide increased gross profits. We expect to record additional cost of revenue restructuring
related charges in the amount of 5.2 million through the second quarter of 2025. These charges include certain estimates that are provisional
and include management judgments and assumptions that could change materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results
may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could result in additional restructuring related charges not reflected. 

29 

Marketing and Sales 

Marketing and sales expense
decreased 9.9 million, or 18.7 , to 42.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.8 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease primarily consisted of a 9.1 million decrease in advertising spending over last year when
we invested heavily to support our new product launch. As a percentage of net revenues, advertising spend was 13.7 in the third quarter
of 2024 compared to 18.1 in the third quarter of 2023. The lower percentage of revenues reflected the impact of using more efficient
advertising techniques in 2024 as compared to management s use of expanded marketing efforts in 2023 to support the launch of our
new product lineups. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative
expense decreased 0.3 million, or 1.5 , to 17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.5 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease primarily reflected the net effect of a 1.7 million decrease in legal and professional
fees that was partially offset by a 1.3 million increase in compensation expense, which included severance costs associated with the
Restructuring Plan. There will be no additional severance cost associated with the Restructuring Plan recorded in General and Administrative
expenses. 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs
increased 0.2 million, or 8.0 , to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is consistent with our continued focus on product development and generating new products. 

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Related
Charges 

 In
August 2024, we initiated a Restructuring Plan to permanently close our two Utah manufacturing facilities and consolidate mattress
production in our Georgia plant. The Restructuring Plan also provided for a headcount reduction at our Utah headquarters to drive additional
operating efficiencies. The 18.9 million of restructuring and impairment charges recorded during the third quarter of 2024 included
 2.4 million of employee-related costs, 0.4 million of accelerated depreciation on non-manufacturing assets, 5.1 million related to
write-downs of long-lived assets to be disposed of or equipment in progress that will not be put in service, and 11.0 million of impairment
charges which included 2.5 million associated with entering into a sublease for one of the Utah manufacturing facilities to be closed
and 8.5 million for the write-off of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We expect to record additional restructuring and other related
charges in the amount of 4.7 million through the second quarter of 2025. These charges include certain estimates that are provisional
and include management judgments and assumptions that could change materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results
may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could result in additional restructuring, impairment or other related
charges not reflected. 

Loss on Impairment of Goodwill 

We
recorded a 6.9 million loss on impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of an impairment assessment performed
that determined goodwill was impaired. An ongoing decline in our market capitalization, along with other qualitative considerations,
was determined to be a triggering event for potential goodwill impairment. The Company, considered as a single reporting unit, estimated
the implied fair value of its goodwill as of September 30, 2023 using a variety of valuation methods, including both the income and market
approaches. 

Operating Loss 

Operating loss increased 14.2
million, or 43.5 , to 46.8 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.6 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The larger operating loss in 2024 primarily resulted from restructuring and impairment charges recorded during the
third quarter of 2024. We expect to record additional restructuring and other related charges of 4.7 million through the second quarter
of 2025. These charges include certain estimates that are provisional and include management judgments and assumptions that could change
materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could
result in additional restructuring, impairment or other related charges not reflected. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense totaled 4.4
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase
was primarily due to interest incurred on the Related Party Loan that was entered into in January 2024 to refinance the term loan and
revolving line of credit associated with the 2023 Credit Agreements. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2023 reflected interest
incurred on the 2023 Credit Agreements. 

30 

Other Income, Net 

Other income increased to
 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This
increase was due to 7.3 million of proceeds received in July 2024 for the remaining settlement amount due pursuant to a previously filed
business interruption insurance claim. 

Change in Fair Value Warrant Liabilities 

In January 2024, in connection
with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we issued 20.0 million Warrants to the Lenders. These Warrants contain certain provisions
that do not meet the criteria for equity classification and therefore are recorded as liabilities. This liability is re-measured to fair
value at each reporting date or exercise date with changes in the fair value included in earnings. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding
Warrants had a fair value of 19.7 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 4.8 million for
the decrease in fair value of the Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024 as compared to the fair value of the Warrants outstanding
at the end of the second quarter of 2024. 

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 

We recorded a 3.1 million
loss on extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2023. In connection with the execution of the 2023 Credit Agreements, the Company
terminated its 2020 Credit Agreement. While the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement at that time, the
termination was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of 2023 and 3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance
costs were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt. 

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 

We had income tax expense
of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to negligible income tax expense for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The income tax expense amounts in both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were related to various state taxes. 

Noncontrolling Interest 

We calculate net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on a quarterly basis using their weighted average ownership percentage. Net loss attributed
to noncontrolling interests was 0.1 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30,
2023.

Revenues, Net 

Net revenues decreased 5.7
million, or 1.6 , to 358.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 364.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. From a sales channel perspective, DTC net revenues decreased 10.7 million, or 5.0 , and wholesale net revenues increased
 5.0 million, or 3.3 . Within DTC, e-commerce net revenues decreased 14.1 million, or 8.7 , while Purple showroom net revenues increased
 3.4 million, or 6.5 . The decrease in e-commerce net revenues reflected the ongoing impact of deteriorating industry trends that have
led to demand softness for most big-ticket home-related discretionary items. The growth in Purple showroom net revenues was driven by
an increase in average selling prices from both strategic price adjustments and a sizeable mix shift into our higher priced Luxe Products.
We also expanded the number of retail locations from 56 at the end of the prior year third quarter to 59 at the end of the third quarter
of 2024. The increase in wholesale channel net revenues was largely driven by the continued positive response of our existing wholesale
partners during the first two quarters of 2024 after transitioning to the new product lineups in 2023. 

Total Cost of Revenues 

Total cost of revenues decreased 8.2 million, or 3.4 , to 233.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 241.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was
due to lower sales volume coupled with lower production costs that were largely attributable to supply chain initiatives and operational
efficiency improvements implemented over the last 12 months. This decrease was offset in part by 12.9 million of restructuring related
charges associated with the Restructuring Plan. We also experienced non-recurring costs in 2023 associated with the transition to our
new product lineup. Our gross profit percentage, which increased to 35.1 of net revenues in the first nine months of 2024 from 33.8 
in the first nine months of 2023, reflected improved production effectiveness in 2024 due primarily to supply chain initiatives and manufacturing
efficiencies. These savings were offset in part by the 12.9 million of restructuring related charges coupled with a shift in revenue
to our wholesale channel, which carries a lower average selling price than sales from our DTC channels. We believe the Restructuring Plan
will achieve further operational efficiencies and provide increased gross profits. We expect to record additional cost of revenues restructuring
related charges in the amount of 5.2 million through the second quarter of 2025. These charges include certain estimates that are provisional
and include management judgments and assumptions that could change materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results
may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could result in additional restructuring related charges not reflected. 

32 

Marketing and Sales 

Marketing and sales expense
decreased 11.6 million, or 8.4 , to 125.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 137.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease primarily reflected a 12.2 million decrease in advertising spending over last year when
we invested heavily to support our new product launch. As a percentage of net revenues, advertising spend was 12.5 in 2024 compared to
15.7 in 2023. The lower percentage of revenues reflected the impact of using more efficient advertising techniques in 2024 as compared
to management s use of expanded marketing efforts in 2023 to support the launch of our new product lineups. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative
expense decreased 12.5 million, or 18.5 , to 55.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 67.6 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to 2023 including 14.2 million of non-recurring legal and professional
costs incurred by the Board s special committee and a 2.3 million reduction in other professional fees. These reductions were partially
offset by a 4.3 million increase in compensation expense, which included severance costs associated with the Restructuring Plan. There
will be no additional severance cost associated with the Restructuring Plan recorded in general and administrative expense. 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs
increased 1.6 million, or 17.5 , to 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.0 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a loss incurred on the write off of a project coupled with increased
investment in new research and development initiatives. 

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Related
Charges 

In
August 2024, we initiated a Restructuring Plan to permanently close our two Utah manufacturing facilities and consolidate mattress
production in our Georgia plant. The Restructuring Plan also provided for a headcount reduction at our Utah headquarters to drive additional
operating efficiencies. The 18.9 million of restructuring and impairment charges recorded during the third quarter of 2024 included
 2.4 million of employee-related costs, 0.4 million of accelerated depreciation, 5.1 million related to write-downs of long-lived assets
to be disposed of or equipment in progress that will not be put in service, and 11.0 million of impairment charges which included 2.5
million associated with entering into a sublease for one of the Utah manufacturing facilities to be closed and 8.5 million for the write-off
of and indefinite-lived intangible asset. We expect to record additional restructuring and other related charges in the amount of 4.7
million through the second quarter of 2025. These charges include certain estimates that are provisional and include management judgments
and assumptions that could change materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results may differ from these estimates,
and the completion of our plan could result in additional restructuring, impairment or other related charges not reflected. 

Loss on Impairment of Goodwill 

We recorded a 6.9
 million loss on impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of an impairment assessment performed that
 determined goodwill was impaired. An ongoing decline in our market capitalization, along with other qualitative considerations was
 determined to be a triggering event for potential goodwill impairment. The Company, considered as a single reporting unit, estimated
 the implied fair value of its goodwill using a variety of valuation methods, including both the income and market approaches. 

Operating Loss 

Operating
loss decreased 13.0 million, or 13.4 , to 84.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 97.5 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The smaller operating loss primarily resulted from an increase in gross profit, a decrease in ad
spend, a decrease in general and administrative expense, and 2023 including a loss on impairment of goodwill. These increases to operating
income were partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges recorded in 2024 related to the Restructuring Plan. We expect to
record additional restructuring and other related charges of 9.9 million through the second quarter of 2025. These charges include certain
estimates that are provisional and include management judgments and assumptions that could change materially as we complete the execution
of our plans. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could result in additional restructuring,
impairment or other related charges not reflected. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense totaled 13.0
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase
was primarily due to interest incurred on the Related Party Loan that was entered into in January 2024 to refinance the term loan and
revolving line of credit associated with the 2023 Credit Agreements. Interest expense in the first nine months of 2023 was lower in part
because the term loan associated with the 2020 Credit Agreement was repaid in full in February 2023 and the 2023 Credit Agreements did
not go into effect until August 2023. 

Other Income, Net 

Other income increased to
 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This
increase was due to 4.3 million of proceeds received in January 2024 as partial settlement for a previously filed business interruption
insurance claim and 7.3 million of additional proceeds received in July 2024 for the remaining settlement payment due pursuant to the
same previously filed business interruption claim. 

33 

Change in Fair Value Warrant Liabilities 

In January 2024, in connection with the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, we issued 20.0 million Warrants to the Lenders. These Warrants contain certain provisions that do not meet
the criteria for equity classification and therefore are recorded as liabilities. The initial liability for these Warrants was recorded
at a fair value of 19.6 million on the date of issuance with the offset included in debt issuance costs. This liability is being re-measured
to fair value at each reporting date or exercise date with changes in the fair value included in earnings. At September 30, 2024, the
Warrants had a fair value of 19.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss of 0.1 million for
the increase in fair value of the Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024 as compared to the fair value of the Warrants on the date
of issuance. 

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 

Loss on extinguishment of
debt totaled 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. In January 2024, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that terminated and paid off our 2023 Credit Agreements.
This termination was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and 3.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were recorded as loss
on extinguishment of debt in 2024. In February 2023, we accounted for an amendment to the 2020 Credit Agreement as an extinguishment of
debt and 1.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt in 2023. In connection with the
execution of the 2023 Credit Agreements in August 2023, the Company terminated its 2020 Credit Agreement. While the Company had no outstanding
borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement at that time, the termination was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt during the third
quarter of 2023 and 3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt. 

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 

We had income tax expense
of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 0.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The income tax expense amounts in both 2024 and 2023 were related to various state taxes. 

Noncontrolling Interest 

We calculate net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests
on a quarterly basis using their weighted average ownership percentage. Net loss attributed to noncontrolling interests was 0.2 million
and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal sources of funds
are cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand, supplemented with borrowings made pursuant to our Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement and proceeds received from offerings of our equity capital. Principal uses of funds consist of capital expenditures,
working capital needs and operating lease payment obligations. In accordance with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we have elected
to pay interest in kind on our new loan to reduce cash obligations. Our working capital needs depend largely upon the timing of cash receipts
from product sales, payments to vendors and others, changes in inventories, and operating lease payment obligations. Our cash and cash
equivalents and working capital positions were 23.4 million and 28.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 compared to 26.9
million and 30.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Cash used for capital expenditures totaled 6.4 million and 9.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our capital expenditures in 2024 have primarily consisted of additional
investments made in our manufacturing operations and showroom facilities. Additional details about our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
are described above under Recent Developments in our Business Debt Financing. 

Based on our current projections,
we believe our cash on hand, expected cash to be generated from our operations and up to 19.0 million additional cash available under
our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on terms requested by us to the extent agreed to by the Lenders at their discretion, will
be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and cover anticipated capital expenditures for the next 12 months. Also,
in August 2024, we announced our Restructuring Plan. We believe consolidation of our manufacturing footprint is an important step to advance
our grid innovation and build momentum to achieve positive operating cash flow and market share growth over the long term. In the event
our cash flow from operations or other sources of financing are less than anticipated, we believe we will be able to fund operating expenses
based on our ability to scale back operations, reduce marketing spend, and postpone or discontinue our growth strategies. Such actions
could result in slower growth or no growth, and we may lose key suppliers, be unable to timely satisfy customer orders, and be unable
to retain all of our employees. In addition, we may be forced to restructure our obligations to creditors, pursue work-out options
or other protective measures. We may also need to seek additional funding sources including new debt from subordinated lenders or equity
capital. However, such additional debt or equity capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Our ability to raise
additional debt financing would require the consent of the Lenders.

Other Contractual Obligations 

Other material contractual
obligations primarily include operating lease payment obligations. See Note 9 - Leases of the condensed consolidated financial
statements for additional information on leases. 

Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September

Cash used in operating activities was 24.6 million and 55.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Significant components of the year-over-year change in cash used
in operating activities included a 13.3 million decrease in net loss, 29.1 million of noncash restructuring, impairment and other
related charges, and 7.0 million of paid-in-kind interest, offset in part by a 17.1 million fluctuation in accounts payable due to timing
of vendor payments. 

 Cash used in investing activities
reflected capital expenditures of 6.4 million and 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital
expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 primarily consisted of additional investments made in our manufacturing operations and showroom
facilities. 

Cash provided by financing
activities was 27.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 50.8 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 included 61.0 million of proceeds received from the Related Party
Loan under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, offset in part by a 25.0 million payment to pay off the Term Loans from the 2023
Credit Agreement, a 5.0 million payment to pay off the ABL Loans from the 2023 Credit Agreement, and payments of 3.5 million for debt
issuance costs associated with entering into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Risk 

Our operating results are
subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on the outstanding borrowings. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors,
including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. The proceeds we
received from the Related Party Loan entered into in January 2024 bears interest at a variable rate which exposes us to market risks relating
to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had 68.0 million of variable rate debt associated with the Related Party Loan.
Based on this debt level, an increase of 100 basis points in the effective interest rate on the outstanding debt amount would result in
an increase in interest expense of approximately 0.7 million over the next 12 months. 

We do not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO and together with the CEO, the Certifying
Officers ), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based upon this evaluation,
and the above criteria, our Certifying Officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 

(b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting. 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

36 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company is from time to
time involved in various claims, legal proceedings and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Please refer to Note 14
 Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report for certain information
regarding our legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Except
as described below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024.The disclosure of risks identified below does not imply that the risk has not already materialized. 

The cost of the
Restructuring Plan may exceed our estimates and we may not otherwise realize the intended benefits of the Restructuring Plan, which could
adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. 

The
costs of the Restructuring Plan may exceed our estimates, and we may not achieve the targeted financial benefits or generate additional
savings to invest in growth. We may have trouble relocating equipment to Georgia and expanding our Georgia manufacturing workforce. As
we replace experienced Utah manufacturing employees with inexperienced employees in Georgia, we may lose continuity and accumulated knowledge,
as well as experience a decline in productivity, which may negatively impact our production efficiency and quality. We may experience
an increase in the cost of distribution due to manufacturing in only one region of the United States. During the process of consolidation,
we could encounter disruptions with respect to inventory levels or raw material supply due to shifting plant volumes. We may not be able
to timely sublease our Utah manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition. The reduction in our workforce
and related restructuring, including the loss of jobs in Utah, could damage employee morale, our business reputation, and our ability
to attract and retain highly skilled employees, which could adversely affect our business. 

Disruption of our manufacturing
operations has and could increase our costs of doing business or lead to delays in shipping our products and could materially adversely
affect our business, our results of operations, and our financial condition. 

The
disruption of our manufacturing operations for a significant period of time, or even permanently, such as due to the Restructuring Plan
or a closure related to restructuring, a pandemic, natural disasters, the termination or expiration of a lease or mechanical failures
in our manufacturing equipment, would likely increase our costs of doing business and lead to delays in manufacturing and shipping our
products to customers and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our financial condition including our cash flows.
In addition, the occurrence of workplace injuries or other industrial accidents at one or more of our manufacturing plants has required,
and may require in the future, that we suspend production or modify our operations, which could lead to delays in manufacturing and shipping
our products to customers. Likewise, acts of workplace violence may require us to temporarily suspend production or modify our operations.
Such delays could adversely affect our customer satisfaction, results of operations, financial condition including our cash flows. As
a result of the Restructuring Plan, we may be at increased risk of disruption to our manufacturing operations by any event affecting that
plant including but not limited to a regional economic downturn, hurricanes and other natural disasters, closure due to a pandemic, the
unavailability of utilities, or any other events that impacts our manufacturing and operating activities in Georgia, which could adversely
affect our business. 

NASDAQ
may delist our securities from its exchange, which could harm our business and limit our stockholders liquidity. 

Our Common Stock is currently
listed on NASDAQ, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. However, we cannot assure that our Common Stock will continue
to be listed on NASDAQ in the future. In order to continue listing our Common Stock on NASDAQ, we must maintain certain governance, financial,
distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders equity, a minimum number of
holders of our Common Stock, and a 1.00 minimum per share bid price for our Common Stock. If we fail to maintain a 1.00 minimum per
share bid price for a period of 30 consecutive business days, we have 180 calendar days to maintain our Common Stock at a 1.00 minimum
per share bid price for 10 consecutive trading days. If we do not regain compliance within 180 calendar days, NASDAQ may grant a second
compliance period of 180 calendar days or it may make a determination to delist our Common Stock, at which point we would have an opportunity
to appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel. Our Common Stock has been trading below the 1.00 minimum per share bid price
since September 30, 2024. If our common stock continues to close below the 1.00 minimum per share requirement, we would then be required
to file a Form 8-K reporting the receipt of a notice of delisting and failure to satisfy a continued listing rule or standard. Such public
disclosure may lead to a limited amount of analyst coverage and have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. 

If we are unable to comply
with the continued listing requirements, our Common Stock may be subject to delisting. If NASDAQ delists our Common Stock from trading
on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be
quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our securities; 

a determination that our Common Stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

37 

Future use and amount of our Current NOLs
and other tax benefits is uncertain. 

On June 27, 2024, our Board
approved the adoption of the NOL Rights Plan to protect stockholder value by attempting to safeguard our ability to use Current NOLs of
approximately 238 million to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations from becoming substantially limited by future ownership
of our Common Stock. At the Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders ratified the NOL Rights Plan. Pursuant to the NOL Rights
Plan, the Board authorized and declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders of record at
the close of business on July 26, 2024. Upon a stockholder acquiring greater than a 4.9 ownership percentage threshold (or, if a stockholder
has beneficial ownership of in excess of 4.9 , then the ownership percentage that is one-half of one percentage point greater than their
current beneficial ownership percentage), the Rights will become exercisable to significantly dilute any stockholder who violates the
ownership limitations of the NOL Rights Plan. In connection with the NOL Rights Plan, the Board adopted, and recommended that our stockholders
approve, the NOL Protective Charter Amendment that adds an additional layer of protection to our Current NOLs until June 30, 2025 by voiding
any transfer of Common Stock that results in a stockholder acquiring beyond a 4.9 ownership percentage threshold (or, if a stockholder
has current beneficial ownership of in excess of 4.9 , then the ownership percentage that is one-half of one percentage point greater
than their current beneficial ownership percentage). At the Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the NOL Protective
Charter Amendment. 

Our use of our Current NOLs
and other tax benefits depends on our ability to generate taxable income in the future. We cannot ensure whether we will have future taxable
income in any applicable period or, if we do, whether such income or our Current NOLs or other tax benefits at such time will exceed any
potential limitation under Code Section 382. 

The IRS may challenge our Current NOLs and
other tax benefits . 

As of September 30, 2024,
the amount of our Current NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ). The
IRS could challenge the amount of our Current NOLs, which could result in an increase in our future liability for income taxes. In addition,
determining whether an ownership change under Code Section 382 has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity
and ambiguity of the provisions of Code Section 382 and because of limitations on the knowledge that any publicly traded company can have
about the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities on a timely basis. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the IRS or another taxing
authority will not claim that we experienced an ownership change under Code Section 382 and attempt to reduce the benefit of our Current
NOLs and other tax benefits available to us at such time, even if the NOL Protective Charter Amendment is in place. 

There is continued risk of ownership change
under Code Section 382 . 

Although the NOL Protective
Charter Amendment and NOL Rights Plan are intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Code Section 382, we cannot ensure
that the NOL Protective Charter Amendment and the NOL Rights Plan will be effective. The amount by which an ownership interest under Code
Section 382 may change in the future could, for example, be affected by purchases of our Common Stock by stockholders who are 5 -stockholders
(as defined under Code Section 382) or by purchases of stock or other interests in corporations, partnerships or other legal entities
that own 4.9 or more of our Common Stock, over which we have no control. Further, while the NOL Protective Charter Amendment and the
NOL Rights Plan allow for the exercise of currently outstanding conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options or otherwise,
such exercises may result in an ownership change under Code Section 382. It may also be in our best interests, taking into account all
relevant facts and circumstances at the time, to permit the acquisition of our Common Stock in excess of the specified limitations or
to issue new or redeem existing equity in the future, all of which may increase the likelihood of an ownership change under Code Section
382. 

The NOL Protective Charter Amendment and
the NOL Rights Plan may potentially adversely affect the market for, and negatively impact the value of, our Common Stock . 

The NOL Protective Charter
Amendment and the NOL Rights Plan are intended to prohibit or deter a stockholder s ability to acquire, directly, indirectly or
constructively, additional shares of our Common Stock in excess of the specified limitations. As such, a stockholder s ability to
dispose of our Common Stock may be limited by reducing the class of potential acquirers for such shares. In addition, a stockholder s
ownership of our Common Stock may become subject to the restrictions of the NOL Protective Charter Amendment, or may trigger applicable
thresholds under the NOL Rights Plan, upon actions taken by Persons (as such term is defined in the NOL Protective Charter Amendment or
the NOL Rights Plan, as applicable) related to, or affiliated with, such stockholder. 

Because the NOL Protective
Charter Amendment and the NOL Rights Plan were approved by our stockholders at the Special Meeting, we have included a legend reflecting
the transfer restrictions included in the NOL Protective Charter Amendment and the Rights issued pursuant to the NOL Rights Plan on certificates
representing newly issued or transferred shares of our Common Stock and disclosed such Rights and restrictions to Persons holding our
Common Stock in uncertificated form, and to the public generally. Because certain buyers, including Persons who wish to acquire more than
4.9 of our Common Stock and certain institutional holders who may not be comfortable holding our Common Stock with restrictive legends,
may choose not to purchase our Common Stock, the NOL Protective Charter Amendment and the NOL Rights Plan could have an adverse effect
on the marketability and trading value of our Common Stock in an amount that could more than offset any value preserved from protecting
our Current NOLs. The NOL Protective Charter Amendment and NOL Rights Plan could also have a negative impact on the trading value of our
Common Stock by deterring Persons or groups of Persons from acquiring our Common Stock, including in acquisitions that might result in
some or all of our stockholders receiving a premium above market value. 

The NOL Protective Charter Amendment and
the NOL Rights Plan may have an anti-takeover effect . 

While the NOL Protective Charter
Amendment is not intended to prevent, or even discourage, a proposal to acquire the Company, the NOL Protective Charter Amendment may
have a potential anti-takeover effect because, among other things, it will restrict the ability of a Person, entity or group to accumulate
more than 4.9 of our Common Stock and the ability of Persons, entities or groups now owning more than 4.9 of our Common Stock to acquire
any significant amount of additional shares of our Common Stock, in each case, without the approval of our Board. Similarly, while the
NOL Rights Plan is not intended to prevent, or even discourage, a proposal to acquire the Company the NOL Rights Plan may have a potential
anti-takeover effect because, among other things, an Acquiring Person (as such term is defined in the NOL Rights Plan) may have its ownership
interest diluted upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Accordingly, the overall effects of the NOL Protective Charter Amendment and
NOL Rights Plan may be to render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or assumption of control by a substantial
holder of our Common Stock, and have an adverse effect on the marketability and the trading value of our Common Stock. However, the NOL
Protective Charter Amendment and NOL Rights Plan should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board.

Future sales of our Common Stock in the
public market may depress our share price. 

Sales of a substantial number
of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of
our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for equity securities, regardless of whether there is any relationship between such sales and the performance of
our business. 

In
connection with the issuance of Warrants pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, on January 23, 2024, the Company entered
into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with CCP, Blackwell, Coliseum
Capital Co-Invest III, L.P. C-3 ), Harvest Master, Harvest Partners, and HSCP (the Holders ), providing for
the registration under the Securities Act of the Warrants, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants and the
Class A Common Stock held by the Holders as of such date (the Registrable Securities ), subject to customary terms and conditions.
The Registration Rights Agreement required the Company to prepare and file with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act a registration
statement to register the resale of the Registrable Securities. On March 21, 2024, the Company filed the registration statement pursuant
to the Registration Rights Agreement which became effective on June 4, 2024. 

The market price of our Common
Stock could decline as a result of sales in the market by a few large stockholders, such as Coliseum or the Holders, or the perception
that these sales could occur, including as a result of the registration statement filed March 21, 2024. These sales might also make it
more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. 

Our stockholders
may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment or may otherwise have their interests impaired if we issue additional
shares of our capital stock, including as a result of the exercise of the Warrants. 

Our Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation allows us to issue up to 300 million shares of our common stock, including 210 million shares
of Class A common stock and 90 million shares of Class B common stock, and up to five million shares of undesignated preferred stock.
For example, in February 2023 we issued 13.4 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering. To raise
additional capital, we may in the future sell additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable
for our Common Stock at prices that are lower than the prices paid by existing stockholders, and investors purchasing shares or other
securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders, which could result in substantial dilution to the interests
of existing stockholders. For example, on January 23, 2024, we issued to the Lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Warrants
to purchase 20.0 million Class A common stock at a price of 1.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Warrants will expire
on the 10-year anniversary of issuance or earlier upon redemption. The exercise of the Warrants will dilute the value of the Class A common
stock and stockholder voting power.
