 Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

The
PubCo has been dormant and non-operating since year 2009. PubCo is a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange
Commissioner SEC ). In November 2009, the Company filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report, and as a result, the Company
was not required to file any SEC forms since November 2009. 

On
December 31, 2019, IVS, the then custodian and control person of GiveMePower Corporation (the PubCo or Company ),
sold one Special 2019 series A preferred share Series A Share for to Goldstein Franklin, Inc. Goldstein ),
a California corporation, controlled by Frank I Igwealor. shares of common stocks at
any time. The Series A Share also provided with 60 voting rights of the PubCo. On the same day, in exchange for 1, Goldstein sold one-member
unit of Alpharidge Capital, LLC Alpharidge ), a California limited liability corporation, representing 100 member owner
of Alpharidge to the PubCo. As a result, Alpharidge become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo until December 30, 2021 when the Company
sold Alpharidge Capital LLC to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a subsidiary of Video River Networks, Inc. both of which are publicly
traded companies with ticker symbols KDCE and NIHK respectively. 

The
Company s operating structure did not change as a result of the change of control, however, following the transaction on December
31, 2019, in which Goldstein Franklin, Inc. acquired control of the Company, Goldstein transferred one of its operating subsidiaries,
Alpharidge Capital LLC into GMPW to become one of the Company s operating subsidiaries. Prior to the transaction, the Company sell
software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada
and the United States. 

On
September 16, 2020, GiveMePower sold and issued shares of its preferred stock (with power), to to Kid Castle Educational
Corporation KDCE ), company related to, and controlled by GMPW President and CEO, in exchange for in cash plus 
interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC CEDC ), a California Limited Liability Company,
and of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation (which holds
 of the total voting powers of KDCE) in an unregistered securities sale. This transaction was accounted for under the Consolidation
Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model wherein the Company consolidates all investees operating results if the Company
expects to assume more than of another entity s expected losses or gains. The shares of GMPW preferred stock acquired
by KDCE gave to KDCE, approximately control of Givemepower Corporation. 

On
April 21, 2021, GMPW sold Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation, to Premier Information Management,
Inc., a company that is also controlled by GMPW President and CEO, Mr. Frank I Igwealor, in exchange for in cash. As further consideration
pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned all of KDCE shares shares of KDCE preferred stock and shares of KDCE
common stock, which altogether control voting power) it held since October of 2019. Pursuant to the April 21, 2021 transaction, CBDX
ceased from being a subsidiary of GMPW, effective April 21, 2021. 

On
December 30, 2021, GMPW repurchased back from KDCE, the GMPW preferred share, which controls block of GMPW, held
by Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a subsidiary of Video River Networks, Inc., in exchange for one of GMPW s subsidiaries,
Alpharidge Capital LLC Alpharidge ), which effectively became an operating subsidiary of KDCE. The consolidated financial
statements of the Company do not include Alpharidge. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include the financial position and operating results of the all wholly owned
subsidiaries of Company including Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. CEDC ). Others include subsidiaries in which
GiveMePower has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions
of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

ASC
810 requires that the investor with the controlling financial interest should consolidate the investee/affiliate. ASC 810-10 requires
that an equity interest investor consolidates a VIE when it retains an investment in the entity, is considered a variable interest investor
in the entity, and is the primary beneficiary of the entity. An investor in a VIE is a variable interest beneficiary when,
per an arrangement s governing documents, the investor will absorb a portion of the VIE s expected losses or will receive
a portion of the entity s residual returns. The variable interest beneficiary retaining a controlling financial interest
in the VIE is designated as its primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. A variable interest beneficiary retains
a controlling financial interest in a VIE when that beneficiary retains the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
have the greatest influence over the VIE s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE s significant
losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the ASC 810 test above,
Kid Castle Educational Corporation is the primary beneficiary of GiveMePower Corporation (the VIE because Kid Castle retained
a controlling financial interest in the VIE and has the power to direct the activities of the VIE, having the greatest influence over
the VIE s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE s significant losses and the right to determine
and receive benefits from the VIE. 

Current
Business and Organization Subsidiary 

The
Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. CEDC ), seeks to empower black
persons in the United States through financial tools and resources. The Company previously envisaged operating three subsidiaries, but
during the fiscal year 2023, decided to jettison two of those subsidiaries namely Malcom Wingate Cush Franklin LLC MWCF and Opportunity Zone Capital LLC OZC ). The Company dropped those two because it had not been able to operate any of them
in the past two years while incurring substantial carrying cost for the two. The company s operations were solely handled by CEDC. 

Current
Business and Organization CEDC 

Community
Economic Development Capital, LLC. CEDC ), a California limited liability company, is a
specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, hemp and cannabis
farms, dispensaries facilities, CBD related commercial facilities, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related
services. CEDC principal business objective is to maximize returns through a combination of (1) generating good profit while making
substantial social impact, (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents, and (3) potential long-term appreciation
in the value of its properties from capital gains upon future sale. The Company is engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management,
acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly multifamily housing and specialized industrial properties in the United States.
This strategy includes the following components: 

Owning
 Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Income. The Company intends to acquire multifamily housings, economic development
 real estates, and multifamily properties. The Company expects to hold acquired properties for investment and to generate stable and
 increasing rental income from leasing these properties to licensed growers. 

Owning
 Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Appreciation. The Company intends to lease its acquired properties under
 long-term, triple-net leases. However, from time to time, the Company may elect to sell one or more properties if the Company believes
 it to be in the best interests of its stockholders. Accordingly, the Company will seek to acquire properties that it believes also
 have potential for long-term appreciation in value. 

Affordable
 Housing. Its motto is: acquiring distressed/troubled properties, securing generous government subsidies, empowering
 low-income families, and generating above-market returns to investors. 

Preserving
 Financial Flexibility on the Company s Balance Sheet. The Company intends to focus on maintaining a conservative capital
 structure, in order to provide us flexibility in financing its growth initiatives. 

Cash
Management, Opportunistic and Event-Driven Investments: The Company keeps no more than 10 of its total assets in liquid cash or
investments portfolio, which is actively managed by its directors and officers and invest primarily in equity investments on a long and
short basis. The Company s cash management policy which requires that the Company actively invests its excess cash into stocks,
bonds and other securities is intended to provide the company greater levels of liquidity and current income. The Company uses proprietary
trading models to capitalize on real-time market anomalies and generate ongoing income in the forms similar to hedge funds. Where necessary,
the Company uses seeded entities to pursue real-time market transactions in publicly traded securities including but not limited to stocks,
bonds, options, futures, forex, warrants, and other instruments. 

The
Company has accumulated deficit for the years ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of and respectively.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Operating results of acquired businesses are included in the Consolidated Statements
of Income from the date of acquisition. The company consolidates variable interest entities if it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary
of the entity. Operating results for variable interest entities in which the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date such determination is made. For convenience and ease of reference, the
company refers to the financial statement caption Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income as pre-tax income

Treasury
Stock Repurchase: We account for repurchased common stock under the cost method and include such Treasury stock as a component of our
Common shareholders equity. 

Retirement
of Treasury stock is recorded as a reduction of Common stock and Additional paid-in capital at the time such retirement is approved by
our Board of Directors. 

Receivables
from Sale of Stock: Receivables from the sale of capital stock constitute unpaid capital subscriptions and are reported as deductions
from stockholders equity, rather than as assets. However, a receivable from the sale of stock to officers or directors may be
reflected as an asset if the receivable was paid in cash before the financial statements were issued and the payment date is disclosed
in a note to the financial statements. 

Expenses
of Offering: Specific incremental costs directly attributable to an offering of securities are deferred and applied to the gross proceeds
of the offering through additional paid-in capital. Management salaries and other general and administrative expenses are not included
in costs of an offering. Deferred costs of an aborted offering, which would include a postponement of 90 days or greater, are expensed
in the period incurred.

likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information.
A liability (including interest and penalties, if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a
tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties,
if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable. 

As
of November 4, 2024, the Company had analyzed its filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions that required the filing
of income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and California are identified as the major 
tax jurisdictions. Generally, the Company remains subject to Internal Revenue Service and California Franchise Board examination of our
2019 through 2023 Tax Returns. However, the Company has some tax attribute carry forwards, which will remain subject to review and adjustment
by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized. 

Management
believed that the income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will
result in a material change to the financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax position have been recorded pursuant
to ASC 740. In addition, the Company not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740. Related interest and
penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.

for the year. Dilutive earnings per share include the effect of any potentially dilutive debt or equity under the treasury stock method,
if including such instruments is dilutive. The Company s diluted earnings (loss) per share is the same as the basic earnings/loss

dilutive effect.

. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is
not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts. It is possible that at times, the company s cash and cash equivalents
with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. In such situation, the Company s
management would assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes
that any associated credit risk exposures would be addressed and mitigated. 

FASB
ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes
a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The
Company s financial instruments consisted of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and line of credit. The estimated
fair value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to or from affiliated companies, and notes payable approximates its
carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments. 

The
Investment Funds may trade futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of a standardized
amount of a deliverable grade commodity, security, currency or cash at a specified price and specified future date unless the contract
is closed before the delivery date. Payments (or variation margin) are made or received by the Investment Funds each day, depending on
the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and the whole value change is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss by the Investment
Funds. When the contract is closed, the Investment Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of
the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. 

The
Investment Funds may utilize forward contracts to seek to protect their assets denominated in foreign currencies and precious metals
holdings from losses due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and spot rates. The Investment Funds exposure to credit risk
associated with non-performance of such forward contracts is limited to the unrealized gains or losses inherent in such contracts, which
are recognized in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 

The
Investment Funds may also enter into foreign currency contracts for purposes other than hedging denominated securities. When entering
into a foreign currency forward contract, the Investment Funds agree to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an
agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon future date unless the contract is closed before such date. The Investment Funds record unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts as measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into
such contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date. 

Furthermore,
the Investment Funds may also purchase and write option contracts. As a writer of option contracts, the Investment Funds receive a premium

writing option contracts, the Investment Funds are obligated to purchase or sell, at the holder s option, the underlying financial
instrument. Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance-sheet risk, as the Investment Funds satisfaction of the obligations
may exceed the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Certain
terms of the Investment Funds contracts with derivative counterparties, which are standard and customary to such contracts, contain
certain triggering events that would give the counterparties the right to terminate the derivative instruments. In such events, the counterparties

Other
Accounting Standards Updates 

In
March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities , which amends FASB ASC Sub-Topic
310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs . This ASU amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable
debt securities held at a premium by shortening the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. This ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted this standard on January
1, 2019 using the modified retrospective application method. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In
August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which amends FASB ASC Topic
815, Derivatives and Hedging. This ASU includes amendments to existing guidance to better align an entity s risk management activities
and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging
relationships and the presentation of hedge results. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted this standard on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant
impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, 
which amends FASB ASC Topic 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income . This ASU allows a reclassification out of
accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity for standard tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and consequently,
eliminates the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on
our consolidated financial statements. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which amends FASB ASC Topic 326,
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In addition, in May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Targeted Transition Relief ,
which updates FASB ASU 2016-13. These ASU s require financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount
to be collected and broadens the information, including forecasted information incorporating more timely information, that an entity
must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured. These ASU s are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018. Most of our financial assets are excluded from the requirements of this standard as they are measured at fair
value or are subject to other accounting standards. In addition, certain of our other financial assets are short-term in nature and therefore
are not likely to be subject to significant credit losses beyond what is already recorded under current accounting standards. As a result,
we currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements ,
which amends FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements . This ASU eliminates, modifies and adds various disclosure requirements
for fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Certain disclosures are required to be applied using a retrospective approach and others using a prospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted. The various disclosure requirements being eliminated, modified or added are not significant to us. As a
result, we currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
That is a Service Contract , which amends FASB ASC Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software . This
ASU adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements.
The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract
with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements
that include an internal-use software license). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either using a retrospective or prospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) 
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . Currently, there is no guidance
in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to
continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide such guidance. In doing
so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management
to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently
in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation
every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans,
(5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a
period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update
are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We currently
do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities. This ASU clarifies that the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements,
and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in
FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The amendments in this ASU are
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on net income. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In
February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations
Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. 
This ASU addresses the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several arrangements
including debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, and settled litigation and judicial rulings. The ASU is effective for public
entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative
Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in
a Foreign Entity . This ASU addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a
part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets
that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The guidance outlines the events when cumulative translation adjustments
should be released into net income and is intended by FASB to eliminate some disparity in current accounting practice. This ASU is effective
prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Liquidation Basis of Accounting. 
The amendments require an entity to prepare its financial statements using the liquidation basis of accounting when liquidation is imminent.
Liquidation is imminent when the likelihood is remote that the entity will return from liquidation and either (a) a plan for liquidation
is approved by the person or persons with the authority to make such a plan effective and the likelihood is remote that the execution
of the plan will be blocked by other parties or (b) a plan for liquidation is being imposed by other forces (for example, involuntary
bankruptcy). If a plan for liquidation was specified in the entity s governing documents from the entity s inception (for
example, limited-life entities), the entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting only if the approved plan for liquidation
differs from the plan for liquidation that was specified at the entity s inception. The amendments require financial statements
prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting to present relevant information about an entity s expected resources in liquidation
by measuring and presenting assets at the amount of the expected cash proceeds from liquidation. The entity should include in its presentation
of assets any items it had not previously recognized under U.S. GAAP but that it expects to either sell in liquidation or use in settling
liabilities (for example, trademarks). The amendments are effective for entities that determine liquidation is imminent during annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods therein. We currently do not anticipate this standard
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

We
have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements. Management does not believe that any recently

Since
January 2022, the Company decided to halt its real estate purchases because of a forecast of series of interest rate hikes coming from
the Federal Reserve. The Company believed that these rate hikes would have a negative impart on the future prices of real estate, which
could fluctuate to a level that could have negative impact on the Company s financial position. 

Corporate
History 

GiveMePower
Corporation (the PubCo or Company ), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on June 7, 2001 to sell software
geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and
the United States. GiveMePower was originally incorporated in Alberta, Canada as GiveMePower.com Inc. on April 18, 2000, to sell software
and web-based services geared to businesses involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products throughout North
America. Effective September 15, 2000, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its corporate name to GiveMePower
Inc. The founder of the Company began the implementation of this business plan under his 100 -owned private company, Sundance Marketing
International Inc. (Sundance). Sundance has been in existence since 1991 and at one time was a market leader in the distribution of survey,
mapping and infrastructure design software in the Canadian marketplace. On April 15, 1999, Mr. Walton entered into a license agreement
with Felix Computer Aided Technologies GmbH (Felix) for the exclusive rights to distribute FCAD software in North America. 

On
December 20, 2000, the Company entered into a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization to undertake a reverse merger with a National Quotation
Bureau public company called TelNet World Communications, Inc. (TelNet). TelNet was originally incorporated in the State of Utah on March
10, 1972 as Tropic Industries, Inc. (Tropic). Tropic became United Datacopy, Incorporated on February 24, 1987 which became Pen International,
Inc. on March 21, 1994 and then TelNet World Communications, Inc. on March 4, 1998. TelNet had no operations nor any working capital
when the Company entered into the reverse merger with it. GMP acquired the rights, title and interest to the domain name, givemepower.com
from Sundance on February 16, 2001. In addition, Sundance agreed to assign its existing customer base to GMP and further agreed that
it would terminate its license agreement with Felix immediately upon GMP securing its own agreement with Felix. GMP renegotiated the
exclusive rights to co-develop, re-brand and distribute FCAD software in North America effective February 16, 2001. Effective July 5,
2001 the Company changed the name of TelNet to GiveMePower Corporation and changed the domicile from Utah to Nevada. 

The
PubCo has been dormant and non-operating since year 2009. PubCo is a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange
Commissioner SEC ). In November 2009, the Company filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report, and as a result, the Company
was not required to file any SEC forms since November 2009. 

On
December 31, 2019, PubCo sold one Special 2019 series A preferred share Series A Share for 38,000 to Goldstein Franklin,
Inc. Goldstein ), a California corporation. One Series A Share is convertible to 100,000,000 shares of common stocks at
any time. The Series A Share also provided with 60 voting rights of the PubCo. On the same day, Goldstein sold one-member unit of Alpharidge
Capital, LLC Alpharidge ), a California limited liability corporation, representing 100 member owner of Alpharidge. As
a result, Alpharidge become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo as of December 31, 2019. 

The
Company s operating structure did not change as a result of the change of control, however, following the transaction on December
31, 2019, in which Goldstein Franklin, Inc. acquired control of the Company, Goldstein transferred one of its operating subsidiaries,
Alpharidge Capital LLC into GMPW to become one of the Company s operating subsidiaries. As the result of above transaction, Alpharidge
Capital LLC became the Company s wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company. 

32 

On
September 16, 2020, as part of its sales of unregistered securities to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, company related to, and controlled
by GMPW President and CEO, the Company, for 3 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, acquired 100 interest in, and control
of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC CEDC ), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97 of the issued and
outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation. This transaction was accounted for
under the Consolidation Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model wherein the Company consolidates all investees operating
results if the Company expects to assume more than 50 of another entity s expected losses or gains. The 1,000,000 shares of our
preferred stock sold to Kid Castle Educational Corporation gave to Kid Castle, approximately 87 voting control of Givemepower Corporation. 

On
April 21, 2021, the Company sold Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation, to Premier Information
Management, Inc. for 1 in cash. As further consideration pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned Kid Castle Educational Inc., the
parent Company of GMPW, the 100,000 shares of KDCE preferred stock and 900,000,000 shares of KDCE common stock that CBDX bought in October
of 2019. Pursuant to the April 21, 2021 transaction, CBDX ceased from being a subsidiary of GMPW, effective April 1, 2021. 

On
December 30, 2021, in exchange for the 87 control block held by Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a subsidiary of Video River Networks,
Inc. both of which are publicly traded companies with ticker symbols KDCE and NIHK respectively, the Company sold Alpharidge Capital
LLC to KDCE. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include the 12 months operating results of the all wholly owned subsidiaries
of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. CEDC ), and the balance sheet represent the financial position as at 12/31/2022
of the Company and subsidiaries including CEDC. Others include subsidiaries in which GiveMePower has a controlling voting interest and
entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC
810 ), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. 

Current
Business and Organization Subsidiary 

The
Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. CEDC ), seeks to empower black
persons in the United States through financial tools and resources. The Company previously envisaged operating three subsidiaries, but
during the fiscal year 2023, decided to jettison two of those subsidiaries namely Malcom Wingate Cush Franklin LLC MWCF and Opportunity Zone Capital LLC OZC ). The Company dropped those two because it had not been able to operate any of them
in the past two years while incurring substantial carrying cost for the two. The company s operations were solely handled by CEDC. 

Current
Business and Organization CEDC 

Community
Economic Development Capital, LLC. CEDC ), a California limited liability company, is a
specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, hemp and cannabis
farms, dispensaries facilities, CBD related commercial facilities, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related
services. CEDC principal business objective is to maximize returns through a combination of (1) generating good profit while making
substantial social impact, (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents, and (3) potential long-term appreciation
in the value of its properties from capital gains upon future sale. The Company is engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management,
acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly multifamily housing and specialized industrial properties in the United States.
This strategy includes the following components: 

Owning
 Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Income. The Company intends to acquire multifamily housings, economic development
 real estates, and multifamily properties. The Company expects to hold acquired properties for investment and to generate stable and
 increasing rental income from leasing these properties to licensed growers. 

33 

Owning
 Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Appreciation. The Company intends to lease its acquired properties under
 long-term, triple-net leases. However, from time to time, the Company may elect to sell one or more properties if the Company believes
 it to be in the best interests of its stockholders. Accordingly, the Company will seek to acquire properties that it believes also
 have potential for long-term appreciation in value. 

Affordable
 Housing. Its motto is: acquiring distressed/troubled properties, securing generous government subsidies, empowering
 low-income families, and generating above-market returns to investors. 

Preserving
 Financial Flexibility on the Company s Balance Sheet. The Company intends to focus on maintaining a conservative capital
 structure, in order to provide us flexibility in financing its growth initiatives. 

Cash
Management, Opportunistic and Event-Driven Investments: The Company keeps no more than 10 of its total assets in liquid cash or
investments portfolio, which is actively managed by its directors and officers and invest primarily in equity investments on a long and
short basis. The Company s cash management policy which requires that the Company actively invests its excess cash into stocks,
bonds and other securities is intended to provide the company greater levels of liquidity and current income. The Company uses proprietary
trading models to capitalize on real-time market anomalies and generate ongoing income in the forms similar to hedge funds. Where necessary,
the Company uses seeded entities to pursue real-time market transactions in publicly traded securities including but not limited to stocks,
bonds, options, futures, forex, warrants, and other instruments. 

BlackBank,
Blockchain-Powered Fintech, Ai and ML Enabled Lending, and CryptoCurrency Deals 

The
Company intends to actualize its banking and financial services operations goals through acquisition and management of (1) a one-to-four
branch bank that is federally licensed in each jurisdiction; (2) a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (Ai) enabled loan
and insurance underwriting platform; (3) blockchain-powered transaction processing and payment systems; (4) cryptocurrency transaction
processing platform; and (5) emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio; a combination of three of which would connects consumers,
banks, institutional investors, and ensure access to the unbanked and underserved residents of majorly black communities across the United
State of America. 

(1)
BlackBank - Proposed Federally licensed one-four branch bank 

Jurisdictionally,
GMPW intend to acquire and manage one-four branch bank in each of its relevant jurisdictional domain. Owning/controlling a bank or banks
with branches across every urban/black neighborhood in the United States is not our goal. Rather we would be content to own a one-four
branch bank in every relevant jurisdiction to allow us to initiate/conduct MAIL enabled and blockchain-powered digitized banking that
is accessible to all black person and businesses across the United States. We intend to start our banking acquisition by finding targets
that operates one-four branches. We intend to start with the acquisition of one-four branch bank, whose operation and back-office would
be migrated unto a Blockchain-powered platform to digitize its entire banking operation to cover and serve all black persons in the United
States. We believe that block chain technology is one of the most suited platform to implement, run and manage a U.S. wide digitized
banking services whose reach encompasses most black persons living in the United States.

Ai and Machine-Learning Enabled Lending and Insurance Underwriting Platform 

Once
it has raised sufficient capital (proposed 10 million offering), the Company intends to launch the Company s cloud-based machine
learning and artificial intelligence lending platform. It is our believe that Machine-Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI),
lending and insurance underwriting platform would enable a superior loan product with improved economics that can be shared between consumers
and lenders. The proposed platform would aggregate consumer demand for high-quality loans and connects it to our soon-to-be-build network
of ML-AI-enabled investors, lenders and bank partners. Consumers on the MAIL platform would benefit from a highly automated, efficient,
all-digital experience. Our prospective bank partners would benefit from access to new customers, lower fraud and loss rates, and increased
automation throughout the lending process. 

Credit
is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, and access to affordable credit is central to unlocking upward mobility and opportunity. The FICO
score was invented in 1989 and remains the standard for determining who is approved for credit and at what interest rate. (Rob Kaufman,
myFico Blog: The History of the FICO Score, August 2018). While FICO is rarely the only input in a lending decision, most banks use simple,
rules-based systems that consider only a limited number of variables. Unfortunately, because legacy credit systems fail to properly identify
and quantify risk, millions of creditworthy individuals are left out of the system, and millions more pay too much to borrow money. (Patrice
Ficklin and Paul Watkins, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Blog: An Update on Credit Access and the Bureau s First No-Action
Letter, August 2019). 

The
first generation of online lenders focused on bringing credit online. Analogous to earlier internet pioneers, these companies made shopping
for and accessing credit simpler and easier for consumers and businesses. It was no longer necessary to stand in line at a bank branch,
to sit across the desk from a loan officer and to wait weeks or months for a decision. These lenders enabled the emergence of personal
loan products that were previously unprofitable for banks to offer. While they brought the credit process online, they inherited the
decision frameworks that banks had used for decades and did not address the more rewarding and challenging opportunity of reinventing
the credit decision. 

GMPW
intend to leverage the power of AI to more accurately quantify the true risk of a loan. The ML- AI models would be built to continuously
self-upgrade, train and refine many critical components of lending risk analytics and decision-making on a real-time basis. We intend
to build discrete ML- AI models that target fee optimization, income fraud, acquisition targeting, loan stacking, prepayment prediction,
identity fraud and time-delimited default prediction. These models would be designed to incorporate multiple lending underwriting variables
and utilize training dataset that accounts for varieties of repayment events. It is also anticipated that the network effects generated
by constantly improving ML- AI models would provide a significant competitive advantage and more training data would lead to higher
approval rates and lower interest rates at the same loss rate

Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform Blackchain 

The
Company intends to acquire an existing, or build-from-the-scratch, a Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions
Processing platform Blackchain ), with home in the BlackBank alongside the MAIL lending platform. Blockchain-powered Payment
and Financial Transactions Processing platform would also provide efficient and inexpensive payment platform and merchant services to
black businesses across the United States. 

35 

The
company would establish an exchange network called Blackchain Exchange Network BEN ), a Payment and Financial Transactions
Processing platform, would be a wholly-owned subsidiary, the BlackBank. We believe Blackchain would be a leading provider of innovative
financial infrastructure solutions and services to participants in the nascent and expanding digital currency industry. Blackchain business
strategy is floating a Blackchain Exchange Network, or BEN, a virtually instantaneous payment network for participants in the digital
currency industry which would serve as a platform for the development of additional products and services. The BEN would have a network
effect that would make it valuable as participants and utilization increase, leading to good growth in BEN transaction volumes. The BEN
would enable the BlackBank to prioritize, build and significantly grow non-interest bearing deposit product for digital currency industry
participants, which is expected to provide the majority of our bank funding in the next two years from finalizing acquisition. This unique
source of funding would be a distinctive advantage over most traditional financial institutions and allows BlackBank to generate revenue
from a conservative portfolio of investments in cash, short term securities and MAIL enabled loans that we believe generate attractive
risk-adjusted returns. In addition, use of the BEN would result in an increase in non-interest income that we believe will become a valuable
source of additional future revenue as we develop and deploy blockchain-powered, fee-based solutions in connection with our digital currency
initiative. We would also evaluate additional products or product enhancements specifically targeted at providing further financial infrastructure
solutions to our customers and strengthening BEN network effects. 

Blackchain
Business Overview 

Once
acquired, the Federally licensed one-four branch bank would be such that is already providing banking and financial services including
commercial banking, business lending, commercial and residential real estate lending and mortgage warehouse lending, all funded primarily
by interest bearing deposits and borrowings. To that up and running banking and financial services operation, we intend to insert a Blockchain-powered
payment and transaction processing system and digital currency platform. We intend to pursue digital currency customers and bring them
into the BlackBank to bank with us using digital currency. We believe we could effectively leverage the traditional commercial bank platform,
the MAIL enabled lending platform and the attributes of the BEN to gain traction in the digital currency banking industry. 

We
intend to focus on the digital currency initiative as the core of our future strategy and direction. We intend to build a leadership
position in the digital currency industry as a result of the BEN to enable us to establish a significant balance of non-interest bearing
deposits from digital currency customer base. Over several post-acquisition years, BlackBank would have transitioned from a traditional
asset based bank model focused on loan generation to a deposit and solutions based model focused on increasing non-interest bearing deposits
and non-interest income. This emphasis on non-interest bearing deposits and non-interest income, is primarily associated with digital
currency, will likely result in a significant shift in BlackBank s asset composition with a greater percentage consisting of liquid
assets such as interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities, and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of
loans. Most of our actions would be focused on developing and delivering highly scalable and operationally efficient solutions for BlackBank s
digital currency customers.

Emerging Cryptocurrency Opportunities Portfolio 

The
emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio is the wildcard of our FINTEC business model. While the goals are clear, because it is
a wildcard, there is no outline on what to expect or how it should be run. GMPW needs these flexibilities because many established companies
are jumping into the crypocurrency opportunities on a minutes notice. For example, in 2020, Microstrategy decided to move their treasury
into bitcoin as part of their cash management strategy. Marathon Patent Group moved into cryptocurrency mining as a business model. Overstock
has been in cryptocurrency for a while. Square and Paypal just joined the bandwagon of American companies that try to find and exploit
opportunities in the crypto currency industry without abandoning their actual businesses. GMPW s emerging cryptocurrency opportunities
portfolio would not be different. The company would on an ongoing basis evaluate and consider investments into potentially viable cryptocurrency
opportunities anywhere. 

36 

Competition 

Our
business is highly competitive. We are in direct competition with more established private equity firms, private investors and management
companies. Many management companies offer similar products and services for business rollups and consolidations. We may be at a substantial
disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out acquisition, operations and restructuring efforts. These
competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger capital-base, marketing, research and acquisition
resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, which
may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging opportunities and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources
to the development, acquisition and promotion. 

Increased
competition could result in us failing to attract significant capital or maintaining them. If we are unable to compete successfully against
current and future competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed. 

We
hope to maintain our competitive advantage by keeping abreast of market dynamism that is face by our industry, and by utilizing the experience,
knowledge, and expertise of our management team. Moreover, we believe that we distinguish ourselves in the ways our model envisaged transformation
of businesses. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
activities currently are subject to no particular regulation by governmental agencies other than that routinely imposed on corporate
businesses. However, we may be subject to the rules governing acquisition and disposition of businesses, real estates and personal properties
in each of the state where we have our operations. We may also be subject to various state laws designed to protect buyers and sellers
of businesses. We cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or our business model. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
currently have no patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property. We do not consider the grant of patents, trademarks
or other registered intellectual property essential to the success of our business. 

Employees 

We
do not have a W-2 employee at the present. Frank I. Igwealor, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is
our only full-time staff as of September 30, 2024, pending when we could formalize an employment contract for him. In addition to Mr.
Igwealor, we have three part-time unpaid staff who helps with bookkeeping and administrative chores. Most of our part-time staff, officers,
and directors will devote their time as needed to our business and are expect to devote at least 15 hours per week to our business operations.
We plan on formalizing employment contract for those staff currently helping us without pay. Furthermore, in the immediate future, we
intend to use independent contractors and consultants to assist in many aspects of our business on an as needed basis pending financial
resources being available. We may use independent contractors and consultants once we receive sufficient funding to hire additional employees.
Even then, we will principally rely on independent contractors for substantially all of our technical and marketing needs. 

The
Company has no written employment contract or agreement with any person. Currently, we are not actively seeking additional employees
or engaging any consultants through a formal written agreement or contract. Services are provided on an as-needed basis to date. This
may change in the event that we are able to secure financing through equity or loans to the Company. As our company grows, we expect
to hire more full-time employees.

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a negative working capital of 6,075, consisting of 9,428 in cash, minus 15,503 current liabilities.
This is comparable to the December 31, 2023 fiscal year end which showed working negative capital of 15,032, consisting of 516 in cash,
minus 15,548 current liabilities. 

For
the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 28,050 on operating activities, generated 0 from investing activities,
and generated 36,992 from financing activities, resulting in an increase in total cash of 8,942 and a cash balance of 9,428 for the
period. For the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 14,078 on operating activities, used cash in the amount
of 0 on investing activities, and used cash of 29,556 on financing activities, resulting in a decrease in total cash of 43,634 and
a cash balance of 957 for the period. 

As
of September 30, 2024, total Liabilities payable to related and unrelated parties increased by 36,961 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Total
stockholders equity decreased by 28,005 to (265,385) as at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 stockholders 
equity of (237,380), due to the net operating loss for the period. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 9,428 (i.e. cash is used to fund operations). The Company does believe our
current cash balances will be insufficient to allow us to fund our operating plan for the next twelve months. However, we shall continue
to access cash advances from our Officers and Directors to fund our operating activities until such a time that we become cash-flow positive
through operating activities. Our ability to continue as a going concern is still dependent on us obtaining adequate capital to fund
operation or maintaining consecutive quarterly profitability. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, or maintaining consecutive
quarterly profitability, we could be forced to cease operations. These conditions could raise substantial doubt as to our ability to
continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our
principal sources of liquidity are: (1) Real Estate Sales, (2) Trading Securities, and (3) Crypto Currency Mining. In the past, we have
been generating cash from loans to us by our major shareholder. In order to be able to achieve our strategic goals, we need to further
expand our business and implement our business plan. To continue to develop our business plan and generate sales, significant capital
has been and will continue to be required. Management intends to fund future operations through private or public equity and/or debt
offerings. We continue to engage in preliminary discussions with potential investors and broker-dealers, but no terms have been agreed
upon. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any equity
financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders. We do not currently have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt
and, accordingly we could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to finance operations. Any such indebtedness could contain covenants
which would restrict our operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has
defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial
condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Based
on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed which are described in Note 3 to our
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions
and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these
estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 13a-15(b), we have carried out an evaluation
(the Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our management, and the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures As of September 30, 2024. Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below, in order to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure (see below for further discussion).We had
neither the resources, nor the personnel, to provide an adequate control environment. 

Due
to our limited resources, the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at September
30, 2024: 

we
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

we
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our limited size
 and early stage nature of operations, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically
 feasible; however, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
 should be performed by separate individuals; 

we
 do not have an independent audit committee of our Board of Directors; 

insufficient
 monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals with current knowledge
 of GAAP that led to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements; and 

we
 continue to outsource the functions of controller on an interim basis to assist us in implementing the necessary financial controls
 over the financial reporting and the utilization of internal management and staff to effectuate these controls. 

We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily related, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in GAAP
and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the
lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems. 

40 

If
and when our financial resources allow, we plan to take a number of actions to correct these material weaknesses including, but not limited
to, establishing an audit committee of our Board of Directors comprised of three independent directors, hiring a full-time Chief Financial
Officer, adding experienced accounting and financial personnel and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls
and recommend improvements. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred As of September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. Legal Proceedings 

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred within the past ten years concerning our directors or officers which involved a criminal
conviction, a criminal proceeding, an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one s participation in the securities or banking
industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations. 

From
time to time we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of the operation of our business in the normal course of
business. Other than as described below, as of the date of this Registration Statement we are not aware of potential dispute or pending
litigation and are not currently involved in a litigation proceeding or governmental actions the outcome of which in management s
opinion would be material to our financial condition or results of operations. An adverse result in these or other matters may have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

On
July 1, 2024, the Company received a Wells Notice which advised that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has made a preliminary
determination to recommend that the Commission file an enforcement action against GiveMePower, Inc. The Notice showed that the proposed
action would allege violations of Securities Act of 1933 Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3); and Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(a), (b), (c) thereunder; and Exchange Act Sections 13(a)
and 13(k) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. The Notice also stated that the recommendation may involve a civil injunctive action
and the commission may seek remedies that include an injunction and civil money penalties. The Company s attorneys are presently
working on an appropriate response to the Notice.
