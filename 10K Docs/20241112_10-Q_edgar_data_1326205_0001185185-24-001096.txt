FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements. Additionally, we, or our representatives, may, from time to time, make other written or verbal forward-looking statements and discuss plans, expectations, and objectives regarding our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Without limiting the foregoing, statements that are in the future tense, and all statements accompanied by terms such as believe, hope, potential, project, expect, trend, estimate, forecast, assume, intend, plan, target, anticipate, outlook, preliminary, will likely result, will continue, and variations of them and similar terms are intended to be forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. Such statements are based on currently available information, which management has assessed but which is dynamic and subject to rapid change due to risks and uncertainties that affect our business. 

For the next several years, we believe our success is highly correlated with the outcome of our clinical trials and secondarily with the sale of our products and services. The Company may not be able to complete human trials on our investigational drug candidates, or, once conducted, the results of human trials may not be favorable or as anticipated or may reflect a lack of efficacy in humans or animals. Precautions, including social distancing and travel restrictions, among others could lead to delays or expenses greater than anticipated or projected. Failure or delay with respect to any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, future results of operations, stock price, and financial condition. 

Our projections and investments anticipate certain regulatory changes and stable pricing, which may not hold out over the next several years. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately or receive patents. We may not receive regulatory approval for our products or trials. The patent applications we have licensed may not be granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ), even if the Company is in full compliance with USPTO requirements. We may not have adequate resources, including financial resources, to successfully conduct all requisite clinical trials, to bring a product based on the above-referenced patented formulations to market, or to pay applicable maintenance fees over time. We may not be able to successfully commercialize our products even if they are successful and receive regulatory approval, including, but not limited to, based on the Food and Drug Administration s FDA current position on hemp and hemp-based products. Failure or delay with respect to any of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business, future results of operations, stock price, and financial condition. 

This document also contains statements that are not approved by the FDA, including but not limited to the statements on hemp and hemp extracts and their potential efficacy on humans and animals. While these statements and claims are intended to be in compliance with federal and state laws, we cannot guarantee such compliance. 

We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions, expectations, plans, and projections subject to risks and uncertainties, including those, if any, identified in the Risk Factors set forth in this report or in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on June 24, 2024 and other documents that we subsequently file with the SEC that update, supplement or supersede such information, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date when they are made. Except as required by federal securities law, we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The purpose of this Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is to provide an understanding of IGC Pharma, Inc. s IGC, the Company, we, our, and/or us consolidated financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. The MD A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2024, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on June 24, 2024 (the 2024 Form 10-K ). The Company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause differences include those discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections and discussed elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those in our forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends. Accordingly, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as expressly required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those outlined in the forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

IGC Pharma is on a mission to transform Alzheimer s treatment. We are attempting to build a robust pipeline comprising five assets, each targeting different facets of Alzheimer s disease at various stages of development. 

IGC-AD1 : Our primary drug candidate, currently undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov, CT05543681), IGC-AD1 holds significant potential in alleviating the burden of agitation in this vulnerable population. This CB1 partial agonist is specifically designed to address neuroinflammation associated with agitation in Alzheimer s patients. 

TGR-63 : Through pre-clinical studies, TGR-63 has demonstrated its potential to disrupt the progression of Alzheimer s by targeting A plaques, a hallmark feature of the disease. This approach offers new avenues for intervening in the underlying pathology of Alzheimer s. 

IGC-1C : At the preclinical stage, we believe IGC-1C represents a forward-thinking approach to Alzheimer s therapy by targeting tau protein and neurofibrillary tangles, crucial contributors to the neurodegenerative process. By addressing these pathological mechanisms, IGC-1C holds potential for disease-modifying interventions. 

IGC-M3 : Also in preclinical development, IGC-M3 aims to inhibit the aggregation of A plaques, offering potential therapeutic benefits in early stage Alzheimer s by targeting the underlying pathology responsible for cognitive decline. 

LMP : Designed to target multiple hallmarks of Alzheimer s disease, including A plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, LMP potentially represents a comprehensive therapeutic approach to addressing the complex pathophysiology of the disease. 

In addition to our pipeline of therapeutic candidates, IGC Pharma is attempting to leverage Artificial Intelligence AI to develop models for the early detection of Alzheimer s and to optimize clinical trial design. By integrating cutting-edge technology with innovative drug development, we are striving to make significant steps in the fight against Alzheimer s disease. 

Furthermore, IGC controls a total of 26 patent filings reflecting our commitment to innovation and intellectual property protection, including for IGC-AD1. Our patent portfolio underscores our dedication to safeguarding our competitive advantage in the market. 

IGC Pharma Inc., is a Maryland corporation established in 2005 with a fiscal year ending on March 31, spanning a 52- or 53-week period. 

IGC has two segments: Life Sciences Segment and Infrastructure Segment.

Life Sciences Segment 

IGC Pharma, a clinical-stage company developing treatments for Alzheimer s disease, is committed to transforming patient care by striving to offer faster acting and more effective solutions. Our lead drug, IGC-AD1, embodies this vision by tackling a critical challenge managing agitation in Alzheimer s dementia. Early results from our Phase 2 trial are promising: IGC-AD1 effectively reduced agitation in patients compared to a placebo, and crucially, it did so much faster than traditional medications. While existing anti-psychotics can take as long as 6 to 12 weeks to show effects, IGC-AD1 has the potential to act within 2 weeks. This significantly faster onset of action could significantly improve patient care and represents a potential breakthrough in managing Alzheimer s-related agitation, although there can be no assurance thereof. In addition, we have created in-house wellness brands, available through online channels that are compliant with relevant federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We derive revenue from our in-house wellness non-pharmaceutical formulations that are manufactured as non-GMO, vegan, products at our facility and are sold over-the-counter OTC ). 

Infrastructure Segment 

The Company s infrastructure business has been operating since 2008, it includes (i) execution of construction contracts and (ii) rental of heavy construction equipment. 

Contract Research Organization (CRO) and Clinical Trial Software 

The IGC-Pharma Electronic Data Capture system IGC-EDC is a secure and user-friendly data management software designed to collect electronic clinical trial data. It includes rigorous security measures to protect data and ensure compliance with regulations. The system is designed for our Phase 2 trial and can store and organize various handwritten source documents. This allows users to generate data reports for analysis and computational models to simulate the effects of our investigational drug IGC-AD1. 

Recognizing the importance of operational excellence and cost management in clinical trials, we have established an internal CRO with proprietary software to reduce trial costs compared to using external CROs. Additionally, we are integrating machine learning and AI into the software framework for improved decision-making, data entry, computational models, trial design (Phase 3), and data analysis. 

Our Business Strategy 

The business strategy includes: 

Subject to FDA approval and clinical trials, developing IGC-AD1 as a drug for treating agitation in dementia due to Alzheimer s. 

Subject to FDA approval, developing IGC-AD1 as a drug for treating Alzheimer s disease. 

Developing TGR-63 for the potential treatment of Alzheimer s disease. 

Driving revenue from in-house OTC brands and formulations. 

Allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. 

We believe developing a drug for both symptom and disease-modifying agents has less risk due to the need for expensive multi-year trials. However, there is considerable upside and significant value creation to the extent we obtain a first-in-class advantage, of which there can be no assurance. If we were to obtain a first-in-class advantage, such an advantage could result in significant growth if and when an approved drug such as IGC-AD1 launches. 

We believe that additional investment in clinical trials, AI, R D, facilities, marketing, advertising, and acquisition of complementary products and businesses will be critical to the ongoing growth of the Life Sciences segment. Although there can be no assurance, we believe these investments will fuel the development and delivery of innovative products that drive positive patient and customer experiences. We hope to leverage our R D and intellectual property to develop ground-breaking, science-based products that are proven effective through clinical trials, subject to FDA approval. Although there can be no assurance, we believe this strategy can improve our existing products and lead to the creation of new products that can provide treatment options for multiple conditions, symptoms, and side effects.

Revenue Revenue was approximately 412 thousand and 291 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenue in both quarters was primarily derived from our Life Sciences segment, which involved providing white-label manufactured products and sales of holistic health care products, among others. The increase in revenue is attributed to the white-label project in the U.S. The Company is committed to its current strategy of driving sales in formulations both as branded and white-labeled products in the Life Science segment. 

Cost of revenue Cost of revenue amounted to approximately 214 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 117 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2023, this represents gross margins of 48 and 60 , respectively. The cost of revenue is primarily attributable to the cost of raw materials, labor, and other direct overheads required to produce our products in the Life Science segment. Typically, the gross margin in the Life Sciences business will fluctuate from one quarter to another based on the mix within the Life Sciences business between white label, private label, and branded products. There is insufficient revenue to model or project gross margins. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A SG A expenses primarily encompass various costs such as employee-related expenses, sales commissions, professional fees, legal fees, marketing expenses, other corporate expenses, allocated general overhead, provisions, depreciation, and write-offs related to doubtful accounts and advances. During the three months that ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses decreased by approximately 356 thousand or 25 to approximately 1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease of 356 thousand is attributed to a decrease in marketing and corporate expenses. 

Research and development expenses R D R D expenses were attributed to our Life Sciences segment. The R D expenses decreased by approximately 351 thousand or 28 to approximately 917 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 1.3 million. It is primarily attributable to the progression of Phase 2 trials on IGC-AD1 and pre-clinical studies on the other small molecule assets. We anticipate increased R D expenses as the development of our other small molecule assets targeting Alzheimer s and the Phase 2 trial on Alzheimer s expand. 

Other income, net Other net income increased by approximately 3 thousand or 8 during the thousand months ended September 30, 2024. As a result, the total other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 is approximately 43 thousand and 40 thousand, respectively. Other income includes interest and rental income, dividend income, profit from the sale of assets, unrealized gains from investments, net income, and income from scrap sales.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions, or foreign currency forward contracts. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity, or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit support to us or that engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

While all accounting policies impact financial statements, certain policies may be viewed as critical. Critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates. Our management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition, inventory, accounts receivable, foreign currency translation, impairment of long-lived assets and investments, stock-based compensation, and cybersecurity. 

Please see our disclosures in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2024 Form 10-K, as well as Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2024 Form 10-K, for a discussion of all our critical and significant accounting policies. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB in the form of accounting standards updates ASUs to the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. Newly issued ASUs not listed are expected to have no impact on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations because either the ASU is not applicable, or the impact is expected to be immaterial. Recent accounting pronouncements that may apply to us are described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II of our 2024 Form 10-K.
