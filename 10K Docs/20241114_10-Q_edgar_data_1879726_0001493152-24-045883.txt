For
entities determined to be VIEs, an evaluation is required to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates
its economic interests in the entity specifically determining if the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance the power and the obligation to absorb losses or the right
to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE the benefits ). When making the determination on whether

cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Periodically,
the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions more than the federally insured limit of per institution. The
amount in excess of the FDIC insurance as of September 30, 2024, was approximately million. The Company has not experienced losses
on these accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to
these deposits is not significant. The Company has also mitigated some of the risk through the use of a premium savings account. This
account is used for amounts that are over a set balance maintained in the Company s general operating account. Balances in the
premium savings account are insured up to million.

a declaration of trust, of the voting rights of Aurea s shareholders have been transferred to the Company so that the Company

VIE s assets and liabilities are consolidated with the Company s financial statements.

million for an aggregate principal
balance of million. The Company recorded a reclassification of from Note Payable related party to Note payable
 non- current (Decathlon note) and recorded forgiveness of note payable related party of . (See Note 12) 

Management
believes that the assumption of the Decathlon Note from CTC is in our best interests because in connection therewith, Decathlon released
us from a cross-collateralization agreement it was a party to with CTC for a loan of a greater amount. Also in connection with the Loan
Assignment on December 3, 2021, we entered into a Revenue Loan and Security Agreement, or RLSA, with Decathlon and our CEO, Carol Craig,
pursuant to which we pay interest based on a minimum rate of one (1) times the amount advanced and make monthly payments based on a percentage
of our revenue calculated as an amount equal to the product of (i) all revenue for the immediately preceding month multiplied by (ii)
the Applicable Revenue Percentage, defined as of revenue for payments due during any month. The Decathlon Note was amended November
16,2023. The maturity date was extended from December 9, 2023 to December 9, 2024 and the monthly interest was converted to a fixed amount
of per month. The Decathlon Note is secured by our assets and is guaranteed by CTC and matures the earliest of: (i) , (ii) immediately prior to a change of control, or (iii) upon an acceleration of the obligations due to a default under the RLSA.
As a result, on December 31, 2021, the Company recorded the forgiveness of note payable-related party of and the reclass of
 from Note Payable related party to Note Payable. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded interest expense of and , respectively, which
included an additional accrual estimate based on the principal and accrued but unpaid interest payment due when the note matures, and
made payments of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded principal
amount and accrued interest of and on the balance sheet, respectively. At maturity the Company will be required
to pay approximately million representing the Decathlon Note and accrued but unpaid interest.

Overview

Founded
in 2012, we are a space mission enabler that provides flexible, cost-effective solutions including custom satellite design, payload hosting,
mission management, space manufacturing and AI enhanced space-based sensor data for government, defense, intelligence, and commercial
companies around the globe. 

Our
adaptable solutions provide mission flexibility while reducing time to orbit. We are able to provide customers a variety of mission options
whether they require a custom satellite design, payload hosting, mission management, or space sensor data as a service. Our solutions
are also cost-effective while still preserving the ability to respond to customer needs. 

Our
modular LizzieSat satellite platform, which is the first of its kind 3D printed, artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced multi-mission
satellite, can host new payloads. Its flexible and modular design also enables it to be customized or scaled to create a new satellite
design in a cost-effective manner to meet mission requirements. 

LizzieSat 
is also able to operate as a data service platform and deliver situational awareness for a wide variety of missions including visual
spectrum, methane, and AIS data collection. And by incorporating FeatherEdge AI into our on-orbit processing, we are able to provide
more efficient and effective data processing and delivery. 

We
have proven space heritage and expertise in multi-disciplinary engineering, mission-critical hardware manufacturing, satellite design,
production, launch planning, mission operations, and in-orbit support. We are strategically headquartered on Florida s Space Coast,
which provides easy access to nearby launch facilities, and we operate a 35,000-square-foot manufacturing, assembly, integration, and
testing facility which is ISO 9001:2015, AS9100 Rev. D certified. 

We
designed, launched, and manage our own satellite LizzieSat , which achieved first launch mission success in March of 2024. The
success of our LizzieSat is built upon our work over the last decade, where we produced numerous flight-proven systems, platforms,
devices and hardware for other customers. 

We continue to focus on innovation and agility. In
October of 2024, we received approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate a micro constellation of remote
sensing, multi-mission satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and we continue to enhance the capabilities of our LizzieSat platform.
Planned enhancements include: 

VPX open architecture with simplified assembly and integration, reduced mass, and better performance 

Integration of a processor capable of handling one hundred trillion or Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS)

provides us the optionality to scale where market needs demand. This diversity mitigates risks associated with external
factors like macroeconomic shifts or technological disruptions. Our flexibility allows us to adapt swiftly to market changes, supporting
growth across all our business lines. 

Products
and Services 

Space-as-a-Service
 capabilities : We replace traditional, product-centric Space business models and transform them into -as-a-Service 
 models. For our customers, their capital expenditures are drastically reduced as design, development, and manufacturing of the satellite
 is no longer necessary. These resources can be redirected towards operations, and operating margins are higher as a result due to
 a more efficient approach to providing the service and taking advantage of lessons learned and economies of scale. 

Satellite-as-a-Service
 (SataaS) : We offer integration of a customer payload or technology and handle the remaining services required including bus
 development, launch, and ongoing mission operations, and provide data validation for success criteria. We consider the continued
 operation of payloads as Constellation-as-a-Service.

 of a complex satellite bus with unprecedented precision, efficiency and modularity. This technology revolutionizes the manufacturing
 process, reducing production costs and lead times while reducing the weight of the satellite bus without sacrificing its structural
 integrity. This 3D material has been used on-orbit and carries a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of TRL-9 for space applications.
 TRL-9 describes the maturity of a technology that has been proven to work during a flight mission in space. 

As
 of September 2024, key achievements and successes include: 

Launched
 the first of several planned hybrid additive in-house manufactured (3D printed) satellites LizzieSats engineered
 to have the capacity and adaptability to simultaneously host payloads for Sidus driven data-as-a-service purposes and/or offer ride-share 
 opportunities for technology customers to deliver data to their end users. 

Established
 on-orbit data operations by completing the commissioning phase and activating payloads. The Sidus team has already achieved several
 primary mission objectives and continues to work through the remaining tasks in a deliberate and systematic approach. Many competitors
 launch a prototype satellite for the first launch, but LizzieSat-1 is a functional satellite with both customer and Sidus-owned technology
 onboard. The NASA Stennis Space Center ASTRA team and Sidus Space successfully completed all ASTRA primary mission objectives on
 LizzieSat-1. Once the ASTRA primary mission objectives were completed, NASA awarded Sidus Space with additional funding to complete
 new critical mission objectives over the course of the next 12 months. 

Signed
 a multi-year and multi-launch agreement with Space-X thereby offering customers by extension a reliable, cost-effective launch service
 with a steady cadence of launches. 

Completed
 build of the second LizzieSat (LizzieSat-2) planned to launch in the fourth quarter of 2024 with Sidus and customer payloads installed.
 Sidus space is nearly complete with building and testing of the third commercial LizzieSat (LizzieSat-3) with Sidus and customer
 hosted payloads installed. LizzieSat-3 launch is planned for Q1 2025. 

Integrated
 Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) software into LizzieSat-1 satellite and demonstrated successful operations to offer on-orbit tailored
 solutions to customers enabling geospatial data to be processed more effectively. LizzieSat-3 is expected to fly the next generation
 version of the integrated Edge AI software which includes multiple enhancements in technology and rapid data transfer. 

Established
 a fully operational mission control center to manage satellite operations, orchestrate collection management tasks and satisfy data
 distribution requests for our own constellations and others. 

Achieved
 flight heritage, which is the history of successful operation of a particular component, subsystem, or system in a space environment,
 for our FeatherEdge edge computing hardware and software solutions. 

Expanded
 our capabilities and opportunities related to geospatial intelligence following the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency s
 (NGA) award to provide research and development services to NGA s Research and Development directorate as a subcontractor to
 Solis Science. 

Expanded
 our capabilities related to Lunar following award of the NASA Lunar Terrain Vehicle Services Contract as a member of the Intuitive
 Machines-led Moon Reusable Autonomous Crewed Exploration Rover team. 

Received approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for
operation of a micro constellation of remote sensing, multi-mission satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). 

Developed the Sidus Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) Switch Card.
The hybrid 3D printed switch card serves as port replicator and extends the capabilities of the payload processor, enabling communication
with multiple optical sensors through high speed LVDS data connections and will be integrated in LizzieSat -2 and 3 enhanced designs. 

Signed an agreement with Neuraspace where Neuraspace will provide Space
Traffic Management and LEOP (Launch and Early Operations) support services to Sidus Space, thereby enhancing Sidus constellation
operation capabilities. 

Successfully completed the primary objectives of the Autonomous Satellite
Technology for Resilient Application (ASTRA) historic In-Space payload mission with NASA Stennis Space Center. 

We
plan to be a global provider of space-based data and insights by collecting data from space with no equivalent terrestrial alternatives.
We plan to initially focus on creating offerings in earth-based observations and Space situational awareness. These decisions are reinforced
by the growing and large addressable markets they represent. 

- 25 - 

Our
LizzieSat satellite platform has been designed to provide differentiated data collection when compared to industry alternatives. We plan
to lead the next generation of earth and space data collection by: 

Collecting
 on-orbit coincident data: LizzieSat is capable of hosting multiple-sensors on the same satellite to collect varying data types at
 the same time and with the same collection geometry. On-orbit coincident collection benefits users by decreasing false positives
 with complementary datasets that reinforce one another. 

Analyzing
 data on the satellite on-orbit: To maximize value and speed in data processing, we invested
 resources into Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) on-board the satellite through hardware and software development.
 Our plans include integrating radiation hardened AI/ML capabilities alongside our on-orbit coincident data collection. 

Reducing
 data size: By processing data at the edge on-board LizzieSat, we reduce the file size by transmitting only the processed solution,
 not the entire raw dataset. This enables us to move data from low-earth orbit to higher orbit data relay services (such as Iridium)
 for a lower-cost and more continual data transmission option to our customers. 

Providing
 a system flexible enough to support new customer missions post-launch (through software and algorithm updates) which allows Sidus
 to generate additional revenue on LizzieSats that have already launched 

The
net value of data collected from our planned LizzieSat constellation is expected to allow organizations to make better decisions with
higher confidence, and increased accuracy and speed. We expect to enrich this processed data with customizable analytics users control
for their own use case, and in turn provide data as a subscription across industries to organizations so they can improve decision-making
and mitigate risk. 

We
support a broad range of international and domestic governments and commercial companies including the Netherlands Organization, U.S.
Department of State, the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, Collins Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Teledyne Marine, Bechtel, OneWeb Satellites,
Parsons Corporation, and L3Harris in areas that include launch vehicles, satellite hardware, and autonomous underwater vehicles. Planned
services that benefit current and future customers include delivering space-based data that can provide critical insight for agriculture,
commodities tracking, disaster assessment, illegal trafficking monitoring, energy, mining, oil and gas, fire monitoring, classification
of vegetation, soil moisture, carbon mass, Maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), Air Traffic Control Automatic Dependent Surveillance,
and weather monitoring; providing the ability for customers to demonstrate that a technology (hardware or software) performs successfully
in the harsh environment of space and delivering space services. We plan to own and operate one of the industry s leading U.S.
based low earth orbit small satellite smallsat or smallsats constellations focused on earth observation
and remote sensing. Our operating strategy is to continue to enhance the capabilities of our satellite constellation, to increase our
international and domestic partnerships and to expand our co-incident data analytics offerings in order to increase the value we deliver
to our customers. Our two operating assets our satellite constellation and hardware manufacturing capability, complement each other
and stem from years of experience and innovation. 

Key
Factors Affecting Our Results and Prospects 

We
believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities but also pose risks
and challenges, including competition from better known and well-capitalized companies, the risk of actual or perceived safety issues
and their consequences for our reputation and the other factors discussed under Risk Factors. We believe the factors discussed
below are key to our success. 

- 26 - 

Expanding
Commercial Satellite Operations 

Our
goal is to help customers understand how space-based data can be impactful to day-to-day business. Our strategy includes increasing the
demand downstream by starting out as end user focused. While others are focused on a data verticalization strategy specializing on key
sectors or a problem set, we believe that flexibility in production, low-cost bespoke design and Bringing Space Down to Earth 
for consumers will provide a scalable model for growth. In Q1 2024, we successfully launched and began operations with our LizzieSat
multi-mission satellite. 

In
Q2 2024, we announced the successful on-orbit activation of the FeatherEdge AI platform which enables us to deliver near real-time intelligence
derived from earth observation data. Further expanding the capabilities of our constellation, we implemented the SatLab A/S second-generation
automated identification system (AIS) technology into the LizzieSat satellite constellation. AIS technology uses sophisticated systems
on board marine vessels to identify and track ships to prevent collisions and protect life at sea. The integration of this technology,
combined with data from optical sensors on board LizzieSat enables unique vessel tracking and monitoring solutions while providing valuable
information about ship movements in real time. 

We
have previously been approved for our X-band and S-band radio frequencies licensing through a published filing by the ITU on April 6,
2021. Such licenses are held through Aurea Alas, Ltd., an Isle of Man company, which is a Variable interest entity to us. The ITU filing
contains approved spectrum use for multiple X-Band and S-Band frequencies and seven different orbital planes, including 45 degrees. In
August 2023, the FCC granted Sidus a LizzieSat experimental launch and operating license for launch and deploy on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Transporter
10 mission. This license includes approval for orbital operations utilizing the previously approved ITU S-band and X-band frequencies
and ground station coverage. We also received FCC Part 25 license approval for the LizzieSat satellite constellation missions two
through five in October 2024. The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, granted a Tier 1 license authorizing Sidus
to operate LizzieSat1-3, a private remote-sensing space system comprised of three satellites (LizzieSat-1 through LizzieSat-3 or LS-1
through LS-3) in 2024. This license was updated and approved by NOAA after LizzieSat -1 launch to reflect the actual orbital data and
planned altitudes for imager operations. 

The
imagery from Near-infrared and Short-wave infrared imagers will be integrated into our FeatherBox AI onboard processor and combined with
AIS data to detect marine traffic migration and illegal fishing activities, detect methane emissions and detect vegetative stress in
various agricultural areas. Any delays in commencing our commercial launch operations, including delays or cost overruns in obtaining
NOAA licenses or other regulatory approvals for future operations or frequency requirements, could adversely impact our results and growth
plans. 

The
exact timing of launches is contingent on several factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of assembly, integrating and
testing of the satellites, regulatory approvals, confirmation of the launch slot timing by the launch provider, logistics, weather conditions,
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

Growing
and expanding our experienced space hardware operations 

We
are seeking to grow our space and defense hardware operations, with a goal of expanding from one shift to two and a half shifts with
an increased customer base in the future. With current customers in the space, marine, and defense industries, our contract revenue is
growing, and we are in active discussions with numerous potential customers, including government agencies, large defense contractors
and private companies, to add to our contracted revenue. In the past decade, we have fabricated ground and flight products for the NASA
SLS Rocket and Mobile Launcher as well as other commercial space and satellite companies. We have supported customers such as Boeing,
Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Dynetics/Leidos, Blue Origin, United Launch Alliance, Collins Aerospace, L3Harris, OneWeb and Space
Systems Loral/Maxar. We have manufactured various products including fluid, hydraulic and pneumatic systems, electrical control systems,
cable harnesses, hardware lifting frames, umbilical plates, purge and hazardous gas disconnects, frangible bolts, reef cutters, wave
guides, customized platforms, and other precision machined and electrical component parts for all types of rockets, ground, flight and
satellite systems.

Vertically
Integrated Space Infrastructure Manufacturing 

We
are designing, developing, manufacturing, and operating a constellation of proprietary smallsats. These satellites are designed for multiple
missions and customers and form the foundation of our satellite platform. Weighing approximately 100 kilograms each, these hybrid 3D
printed, modular satellites are being designed to be more functional than cubesats and nanosatellites and less expensive to manufacture
than the larger satellites in the 200-600kg range. In addition to our own satellites, we are expecting to design and manufacture customized
satellites for LEO and lunar applications for customers that include government and commercial entities. 

Our
cost-efficient smallsats are being designed from the ground-up to optimize performance per unit cost. Our model is a movement from highly
bespoke, costly satellite manufacturing techniques to standardized bus with integration of customer needs at lower costs. We can integrate
technologies and deliver data on demand at lower costs than legacy providers due to our vertical integration, use of commercial off the
shelf (COTS) proven systems, cost-efficiencies, capital efficient constellation design, and adaptable pricing models. 

We
design and manufacture our satellites at our Cape Canaveral facility. Our current configuration and facility are designed to manufacture
multiple satellites per month. Our vertical integration enables us to control our satellites through the entire design, manufacturing,
and operation process. Our years of experience manufacturing space hardware means we can leverage our manufacturing expertise and commercial
best practices for satellite production. Additionally, leveraging both in-house and partner-provided subsystem components and in-house
design and integration services, as well as operational support of satellites on orbit, to provide turn-key delivery of entire constellations
offer concept to constellation in months instead of years. Specifically, our offerings are expected to encompass all aspects
of hosted satellite and constellation services, including hosting customer payloads onto our satellites, and delivering data and constellation
services to customers from our space platform. These services are expected to allow customers to focus on developing innovative payloads
rather than having to design or develop complete satellite buses or satellites or constellations, which we will provide, along with ancillary
services that are likely to include telemetry, tracking and control, communications, processing, as well as software development and
maintenance. Our patented space-related technologies include a print head for regolith-polymer mixture and associated feedstock; a heat
transfer system for regolith; a method for establishing a wastewater bioreactor environment; vertical takeoff and landing pad and interlocking
pavers to construct same; and high-load vacuum chamber motion feedthrough systems and methods. Regolith is a blanket of unconsolidated,
loose, heterogeneous superficial deposits covering solid rock. It includes dust, broken rocks, and other related materials and is present
on earth, the moon, Mars, some asteroids, and other terrestrial planets and moons. We continue to patent our products including our satellites,
external platforms and other innovations. 

Revenue
Generation 

We
generate revenue by selling payload space on our satellite platform, providing engineering and systems integration services to strategic
customers on a project-by-project basis, and manufacturing space hardware to include satellites. Additionally, we intend to add to our
revenue by selling geospatial data and actionable intelligence captured through our constellation. This support is typically contracted
to both commercial and government customers under fixed price contracts and often includes other services. Due to the size and capacity
of our satellite, we plan to host a diverse array of sensors such as Multispectral and Hyperspectral Earth Observing Imagers, Maritime
Vessel RF Tracking receivers, UHF IoT Transceivers, Optical Communications systems, and others on a single platform that can simultaneously
address the needs of many customer requirements. 

Lowering
Manufacturing Cost and Schedule 

We
have developed a manufacturing model that provides rapid response to customer requirements including integration of customers technologies
and space-based data delivery. Our planned satellites are being designed to integrate COTS subsystems that are space-proven, can be rapidly
integrated into the satellite and replaced rapidly when customer needs change or evolve. Our vertically integrated manufacturing processes
give us the flexibility to make changes during the production cycle without impacting launch or costs.

Environmental,
social, and corporate governance 

While
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting is not mandatory, we are developing an ESG policy that will implement the tracking
of several indicators we believe are critical to ensure we are doing our part to continue sustainable growth and maximize shareholder
value. We have been in business for over twelve years manufacturing space hardware and components, and in that time, implementation of
policies and processes to mitigate environmental impact have been of upmost importance. Furthermore, since our inception, we have recognized
the value of our employees and have always prioritized employee well-being through facets such as excellent benefits, programs, educational
assistance, and insurance of a safe and healthy work environment. We also understand that our efforts to promote value and well -being
are not limited to our employees. We are committed to the communities we belong to both locally and professionally. We recently started
to formalize this commitment, providing tangible benefits back to the community that supports us.

Revenue 

Non-related
party revenue increased 131 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2024 to approximately 1.8 million as compared to approximately 762,000
for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily driven by timing of fixed price milestone contracts and increased satellite
related revenue contracts as compared to prior year. Revenue from related parties decreased by 50 to approximately 112,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 223,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was influenced
by the timing of fixed-price milestone contracts and a reduction in the number of contracts our related party secured with its customers,
leading to decreased outsourcing of work to us. 

Cost
of Revenue 

The
increase in cost of revenue of 69 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to approximately 1.8 million as compared to approximately
 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, included approximately 57,500 and approximately 192,000, respectively,
of related party costs of revenue. The overall increase in cost of revenue was driven by a mix of contracts of varying types and increased
depreciation expense in our satellite related business. As a manufacturing entity, materials and other direct costs are a percentage
of revenue. The percent change in the cost of revenue was lower than the percent increase in revenue due to a mix of contracts of varying
types and increased revenue from our higher margin satellite related business, offset by increased depreciation expense related to our
satellite side of the business. 

- 29 - 

Gross
Profit (Loss) 

The
140 increase in our gross profit to a gross profit of approximately 38,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to a gross loss of 96,281 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to a mix of contracts of varying types
and increased sales in our higher margin satellite related business, offset by increased depreciation expense related to our satellite
side of the business. 

Selling,
General, and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses of approximately 3.2 million were down 568,391 when compared with approximately 3.8 million for
the same period in 2023, and was primarily due to the following: 

A
 decrease of approximately 600,000 in 2024 professional fees expense primarily as a result of higher professional services costs
 incurred in 2023 related to legal fees associated with our business acquisition and expense associated with the termination of an
 agreement related to investment banking services as well as 2024 reduction in use of outside legal firms and increased use of internal
 resources. 

A
 decrease of approximately 130,000 in payroll and related expenses primarily as a result of labor hours directly related to building
 the satellite fixed asset reclassed from selling, general and administrative expense to fixed asset. 

A
 decrease of approximately 105,000 in D O insurance expense to approximately 143,000 compared to 248,000 in 2023, due to a
 reduction in insurance rates. 

A
 decrease of approximately 90,000 in marketing and investor relations expense as a result of reduction in use of outside agencies
 and increased use of internal resources. 

These
decreases were partially offset by the following increases: 

An
 increase of approximately 43,000 related primarily to Board related cash and stock compensation as we continue to expand and build
 our Board of Directors. 

An
 increase of approximately 140,000 in monthly consulting outside services costs driven by the growth and needs of our business and
 internal systems. 

An
 increase in Mission Operations Support expense of approximately 63,000 related to ground support required for tracking and communicating
 with our first satellite launched in March 2024.

Total
other income (expenses) 

Other
income and (expenses) showed an increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, of other expenses of 523,347 to 730,691
compared to 207,344 in 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to our note payable which included an
additional accrual estimate based on the principal and accrued but unpaid interest payment due when the note matures.

Revenue 

Total
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 773,000 versus total revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. This is primarily a result of a change in the mix of contracts of varying types. Manufacturing non-related party
revenue decreased 11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to approximately 3.8 million as compared to approximately 4.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily driven by the timing of fixed price milestone contracts and lower satellite
related revenue. Manufacturing revenue from related parties decreased approximately 47 to 409,523 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 from 766,985 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was influenced by the timing of fixed-price milestone contracts
and a reduction in the number of contracts our related party secured with its customers, leading to decreased outsourcing of work to
us. 

Cost
of Revenue 

The
38 increase in cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to approximately 4.6 million as compared to approximately
 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a mix of contracts, a decrease in our higher margin
satellite related business as well as increased depreciation expense in our satellite related business. Cost of revenue from related
parties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus prior year, included approximately 272,000 and approximately 579,000, respectively. 

Gross
Profit (Loss) 

The
decrease in our gross profit of approximately 2.0 million to a gross loss of approximately 719,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to a gross profit of approximately 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable
to a mix of contracts, lower sales from our satellite related business and increased depreciation expense related to our satellite side
of the business. 

Selling,
General, and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses of approximately 9.9 million were down approximately 1.25 million when compared with approximately
 10.9 million for the same period in 2023, and was primarily due to the following: 

A
 decrease of approximately 810,000 in professional fees expense primarily as a result of higher professional services costs incurred
 in 2023 related to legal fees associated with our business acquisition and expense associated with the termination of an agreement
 related to investment banking services as well as 2024 reduction in use of outside legal firms and increased use of internal resources.

A
 decrease of approximately 616,000 in payroll and related expenses primarily as a result of labor hours directly related to building
 the satellite fixed asset were reclassed from selling, general and administrative expense to fixed asset. 

A
 decrease of approximately 317,000 in D O insurance expense to approximately 428,000 compared to 745,000 in 2023, due to a
 reduction in insurance rates. 

A
 decrease of approximately 276,000 in marketing and investor relations expense as a result of a reduction in use of outside agencies
 and increased use of internal resources 

- 31 - 

These
decreases were partially offset by the following increases: 

An
 increase in Mission Operations Support expense of approximately 531,000 to approximately 604,000 compared to approximately 73,000
 in 2023, related to ground support required for tracking and communicating with our first satellite. 

An
 increase of approximately 219,000 in capital raise related costs driven by the growth and needs of our business. 

An
 increase of approximately 184,000 related primarily to Board related cash and stock compensation as we continue to expand and build
 our Board of Directors. 

Total
other income (expenses) 

Other
income and (expenses) showed a decrease of other expenses of 233,068 to 1,217,841 compared to 1,450,909 in 2023 primarily due to a
change in accounting treatment of financing related costs included in other expense in 2023 to 2024 being included in the costs required
to raise capital which are included in additional paid in capital on the balance sheet, partially offset by an increase in interest expense
related to our note payable and asset-based loan facility in 2024. 

NON-GAAP
MEASURES 

To
provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures
of adjusted EBITDA. We use adjusted EBITDA in order to evaluate our operating performance and make strategic decisions regarding future
direction of the company since it provides a meaningful comparison to our peers using similar measures. We define adjusted EBITDA as
net income (as determined by U.S. GAAP) adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition deal costs,
severance costs, capital market and advisory fees, equity-based compensation and warrant costs. These non-GAAP measures may be different
from non-GAAP measures made by other companies since not all companies will use the same measures. Therefore, these non-GAAP measures
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for relevant U.S. GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information
presented on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

The
following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA to net loss (the most comparable GAAP measure) for the three months ended September 30, 2024

Cash
Flow from Operating Activities 

Nine
Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not generate positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities was approximately 10.3 million compared to approximately 10.0
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 10.3 million is comprised of a net
loss of approximately 11.4 million, which was reduced by non-cash expenses of 236,040 for stock-based compensation and approximately
 1.5 million for depreciation, and an increase in net change in working capital of approximately 625,000. 

Cash
flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of approximately 10 million is comprised of a net loss
of approximately 11.0 million, which was reduced by non-cash expenses of 845,029 for the issuance of warrants as compensation of underwriters
services, 15,000 for bad debt and 148,166 for depreciation, and an decrease in net change in working capital of approximately 62,000. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we purchased property and equipment in the amount of approximately 5.1 million and
 5.3 million respectively, primarily related to purchasing satellite related components and software. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided in financing activities of approximately 15.4 million included a January
2024 capital raise of approximately 5.6 million, a February 2024 capital raise of approximately 7.9 million, approximately 1.8 million
in net proceeds from an asset-based loan and repayment of notes payable of 150,000. 

- 34 - 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided in financing activities of approximately 14.5 million included our January
and April 2023 capital raises of approximately 14.8 million net proceeds, partially offset by approximately 2,200 net repayment of
an asset-based loan agreement and repayment of notes payable of approximately 224,000.

Warrant, for which we received approximately 5.0 million of net proceeds. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities
often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting
periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting
policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K,
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies
relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 

We
believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: 

Revenue
 Recognition 

Inventory 

Credit
 losses 

Lease
 Accounting 

Stock
 Option and Warrant Valuation 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective transition approach. The core principle
of ASC 606 is that revenue should be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled for exchange of those goods or services. Our updated
accounting policies and related disclosures are set forth below, including the disclosure for disaggregated revenue. The impact of adopting
ASC 606 was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

- 35 - 

Our
revenue is recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of its services and products to customers in
return for expected consideration and includes the following elements: 

executed
 contracts with our customers that we believe are legally enforceable; 

identification
 of performance obligations in the respective contract; 

determination
 of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract; 

allocation
 of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and 

recognition
 of revenue only when we satisfy each performance obligation. 

These
five elements, as applied to each of the Company s revenue category, are summarized below: 

Revenues
from fixed price manufacturing related contracts that are still in progress at month end are recognized on the percentage-of-completion
method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. This method is used
because management considers total costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Revenue from fixed price contracts
and time-and-materials contracts that are completed in the month the work was started are recognized when the work is shipped. 

Revenues
from fixed price contracts primarily related to satellite payloads that require milestone payments are recognized at the time of the
milestone being met. This method is used because management considers that the payments are nonrefundable unless the entity fails to
perform as promised. If the customer terminates the contract, we are entitled only to retain any progress payments received from the
customer and we have no further rights to compensation from the customer. Even though the payments made by the customer are nonrefundable,
the cumulative amount of those payments is not expected, at all times throughout the contract, to at least correspond to the amount that
would be necessary to compensate us for performance completed to date. Accordingly, we account for the progress under the contract as
a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time. 

Inventory 

Inventory
consists of work in progress and finished goods and consists of estimated revenue calculated on a percentage of completion based on direct
labor and materials in relation to the total contract value. We do not maintain raw materials. 

Credit
Losses 

The
provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables is estimated based on historical information, customer solvency and changes
in customer payment terms and practices. The Company calibrates its provision matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience
with forward-looking information. The amount of expected credit losses is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic
conditions. The Company s historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative
of the customer s actual default in the future. The company utilizes the Allowance Method based on the accounts receivable aging
in order to accrue bad debt expense. 

Leases 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities
that arise from leases in the balance sheet. Additionally, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted
Improvements, which, among other things, provides an additional transition method that would allow entities to not apply the guidance
in ASU 2016-02 in the comparative periods presented in the financial statements and instead recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment
to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. 

We
determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, operating lease liabilities - current, and operating lease liabilities - noncurrent on the balance sheets. Finance leases are
included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our balance sheets. 

ROU
assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental
borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement
date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Leases
with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on our balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over
the lease term in our statement of operations.

Stock
Option and Warrant Valuation 

We
use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value all options and Class A common stock warrants. Estimating the fair value of stock
options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the application of significant assumptions, such as the fair value of our
Class A common stock, the estimated term of the options, risk-free interest rates, the expected volatility of the price of our Class
A common stock, and an expected dividend yield. Each of these assumptions is subjective, requires significant judgment, and is based
upon management s best estimates. If any of these assumptions were to change significantly in the future, equity-based compensation
related to future awards may differ significantly, as compared with awards previously granted. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay
the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

We
are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS
Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain
of these exemptions, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls
over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the
auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion
and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which
we have total annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of
the date of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the
previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
