EXPLANATARY
NOTE 

AgEagle
Aerial Systems Inc. (the Company , we , us , and our filed its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 1,
2024 (the Original Form 10-K and filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the three, six, and nine months ended March
31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023 on May 15, 2023, August 14, 2023, and November 13, 2023, respectively, (collectively
referred to has the Original 2023 Form 10-Qs and filed quarterly reports for the three and six months ended March 31,
2024 and June 30, 2024 on May 15, 2024 and August 14, 2024, respectively, (collectively referred to has the Original 2024 Form
10-Qs ). Subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-K and the Original 2023 and 2024 Form 10-Qs for the year end and interim
periods during our fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024, we identified an error that was present in all aforementioned filings. 

On
November 7, 2024, the audit committee of the Company s board of directors concluded, after discussion with the Company s management,
that the previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the Form 10-Qs
for the quarterly periods March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 should no longer be relied
upon due to the errors discussed below and require restatement. 

We
plan to file an amendment to the Original Form 10-K, correcting the error present at December 31, 2023 and 2022 and restate all of the quarterly financial information in the Original 2023 Form 10-Qs in the amendment to the Original Form 10-K. 

This
Form 10-Q restates the quarterly financial statements periods in the Original 2024 Form 10-Qs and their comparative prior periods. See
Note 12 included in this Form 10-Q to the accompanying quarterly consolidated financial statements for further details of the correction
of the errors and a summary of the impact on the quarterly consolidated financial statements for all periods impacted by the error, which
was isolated to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

Background
of Restatement 

Subsequent
to the filing of our Original Form 10-K and Original Form 2024 and 2023 10-Qs, management identified an error in the computation of
net loss attributable to common stockholders and total comprehensive loss as presented on our consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss included in the Original Form 10-K and Original Form 2024 and 2023 10-Qs. The error in the computation of net
loss attributable to common stockholders resulted in an understatement of net loss per common share basic and diluted as presented
on our consolidated statements of operations and an overstatement of comprehensive loss for the quarterly periods included in the
Original 2024 and Original 2023 Form 10-Qs and the fiscal year ends included in the Original Form 10-K. 

The
net loss attributable to common stockholders erroneously excluded accrued cumulative dividends on outstanding Series F preferred stock
and deemed dividends resulting from the triggering of down round features embedded within outstanding equity-linked financial instruments.
Pursuant to ASC 260 Earnings Per Share, income (loss) available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting dividends
accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock. Also, the value of the effect of a down round feature shall be recognized in
an equity-classified freestanding financial instrument when the down round feature is triggered. That effect shall be treated as a dividend
and as an increase to net loss available to common stockholders in computation of earnings per share. 

Further,
the accrued cumulative dividends and deemed dividends were included as a component of other comprehensive loss. However, pursuant to
 ASC 220 Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income items required to be reported as direct adjustments to
additional paid-in capital and retained earnings are not considered to be components of other comprehensive income (loss).

Board of the Directors of the Company (the Board and became effective on February 9, 2024. All share and per share data

Basis
of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in United States dollars and
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in United States of America US GAAP ). In
the opinion of management, the Company has made all necessary adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, for a fair statement

included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The Company has identified a computation error of net loss attributable
to common stockholders resulting in an understatement of net loss per common share basic and diluted as presented on our consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss that is presented in the previously filed 10-K and will be amending the previous filed
10-K. The results for the three and nine-month periods

Note
1 Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation-Continued 

Liquidity
and Going Concern In pursuit of the Company s long-term growth strategy and acquisitions, the Company has sustained
continued operating losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of and used
cash in operating activities of . As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a working capital deficit of and an
accumulated deficit of . While the Company has historically been successful in raising capital to meet its working capital
needs, the ability to continue raising such capital is not guaranteed. There is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern as the Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations
for 12 months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company is evaluating strategies to obtain
the required additional funding for future operations and the restructuring of operations to grow revenues and reduce expenses. 

If
the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company
could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if
no other means of financing operations are available. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other
adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued 

The
guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 

Level
 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 

For
short-term classes of our financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, notes receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses, their carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The outstanding loan related
to the COVID Loans is carried at face value, which approximates fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company
did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company s condensed consolidated balance
sheets on a recurring basis. 

. The Company has significant cash balances at financial institutions which throughout the year regularly exceed
the federally insured limit of . Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact
on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

and
 ,
respectively. The Company generally does not charge interest on overdue customer account balances. Payments of trade receivables are
allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customer s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest
unpaid invoices. The Company estimates an allowance for credit losses based upon an evaluation of the current status of trade receivables,
historical experience, and other factors as necessary. It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for
credit losses will change.

Our
net accounts receivable represents amounts billed and due from customers. Based on historical perspective, nearly all of our accounts

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as
our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements.
Please see the explanatory note concerning Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item

results for the periods presented were not materially affected by inflation. 

Overview 

AgEagle 
 Aerial Systems Inc. AgEagle , Company , We , Our , Us ), through
its wholly owned subsidiaries, is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class drones, sensors and software that solve
important problems for our customers. Founded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-winged
drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. AgEagle s shift and expansion
from solely manufacturing fixed-wing farm drones in 2018, to offering what we believe is one of the industry s best fixed-wing,
full-stack drone solutions, culminated in 2021 when we acquired three market-leading companies engaged in producing UAS airframes, sensors
and software for commercial and government use. In addition to a robust portfolio of proprietary, connected hardware and software products;
an established global network of over 200 UAS resellers; and enterprise customers worldwide; these acquisitions also brought AgEagle
a highly valuable workforce comprised largely of experienced engineers and technologists with deep expertise in the fields of robotics,
automation, manufacturing and data science. In 2022, we succeeded in integrating all three acquired companies with AgEagle to form one
global company focused on taking autonomous flight performance to a higher level for a wider variety of markets, including defense , public safety, and agriculture/commercial customers. 

AgEagle
has also achieved numerous regulatory firsts, earning governmental approvals for its commercial and tactical drones to fly Beyond Visual
Line of Sight BVLOS and/or Operations Over People OOP in the United States, Canada, Brazil and the European
Union. 

AgEagle
is led by a proven management team with years of drone industry experience and is currently headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, where we
house our business and sensor manufacturing operations; and we operate drone manufacturing operations in Lausanne, Switzerland in support
of our international business activities. 

We
are focused on growing our business, generating cash, and preserve our leadership position by developing new drones, sensors and embedded
software and capturing a significant share of the global drone market. In addition, we expect to accelerate our growth and expansion
through product development and strategic acquisitions of companies that offer distinct technological and competitive advantages and
have defensible high value IP protection in place, if applicable. 

Key
Growth Strategies 

We
intend to materially grow our business by leveraging our proprietary, best-in-class, full-stack drone solutions, multi-spectral sensors,
industry influence, and deep pool of talent with specialized expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data science
to achieve greater penetration of the global UAS industry with near-term emphasis on adding stability and discipline to our operations,
and capturing larger market share of the agriculture, defense, public safety, and agriculture/commercial markets. We expect to accomplish this goal
by first bringing one four re-defined core values to life in our day-to-day operations and aligning them with our efforts to earn the trust and continued
business of our customers and industry partners: 

Innovation
 We strive to innovate, finding new ways to serve our customers and shareholders- these innovations span technology, process
 re-definition, and new ways of thinking about every aspect of our business and customers. 

39 

Integrity this is the foundation for everything
we do, even when no one is watching. 

Transparency
 being honest and open about our performance, strengths, and weakness allows us to improve more rapidly. 

Passion we love what we do each day,
creating the energy to overcome challenges. 

Key
 components of our growth strategy include the following: 

Shift
 priority to a Laser-like focus on the higher volume defense security market. Despite predictions of rapid growth in the
 commercial space, drone surveillance action in the defense and security world has outpaced commercial application in volume and overall
 growth. The current world situation further emphasizes the need for our products, and the validity of the defense market. AgEagle
 will focus on defense growth initiatives while continuing to execute, grow, and maximize our position in precision agriculture and
 other civil and commercial markets. 

Deliver
 new and innovative solutions. AgEagle s research and development efforts are critical building blocks of the Company, and
 we intend to continue investing in innovation, not only in our products, but also in innovative business models and operational methods 

Foster
 our entrepreneurial culture on a bedrock of trust and integrity, continuing to attract, develop and retain highly skilled personnel.
 The AgEagle culture encourages innovation and entrepreneurialism, which helps attract and retain highly skilled professionals.
 In addition, AgEagle is dedicated to integrity and transparency in its business, external, and internal relationships. 

Effectively
 manage our growth portfolio for long-term value creation. Our production and development programs present numerous investment
 opportunities that we believe will deliver long-term growth by providing our customers with valuable new capabilities. We evaluate
 each opportunity, and it s cost, against our mission and strategic priorities, as well as near and mid-term expected returns.
 This process helps us make informed decisions regarding potential growth capital requirements and supports our allocation of resources
 based on relative risks and returns to maximize long-term value creation, which is the key objective of our growth strategy. 

Modify our facility footprint .
 We have set objectives to right-size our physical footprint in Europe and create strategic relationships with key partners in that
 theatre. In addition, we have begun planning for expanding our drone production in the U.S. to serve North, Central, and South American
 customers. 

Growth
 through acquisition. Through successful identification of high-value acquisition targets, we plan to acquire technologically
 advanced companies and intellectual property across an array of airborne platforms, focused robotic technologies, and a variety of
 artificial intelligence-enabled robotics and supporting technologies that complement and strengthen our value proposition. 

Competitive
Strengths 

We
believe that the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages: 

Proprietary
 technologies, in-house capabilities and industry experience We believe our decade of experience in commercial UAS design
 and engineering, in-house manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities, and advanced technology development skillset serve to
 differentiate AgEagle in the marketplace. In fact, approximately 60 of our global workforce is comprised of engineers and data scientists
 with deep experience and expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing, and data analytics. In addition, AgEagle is committed
 to meeting and exceeding quality and safety standards for manufacturing, assembly, design and engineering and testing of drones,
 drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our U.S. and Swiss-based manufacturing operations. As a result, we are actively pursuing and expect to earn ISO:9001 international certification for our Quality Management System within
our senseFly business by Q2 2025. 

We
 leverage maximum use of commercial technology: At AgEagle, we excel in designing and manufacturing small UAS, along with sensors
 and software tailored for UAS applications, providing versatile solutions like our latest product the eBee VISION UAS. This integration
 of commercial technology with dual-use capabilities enables our customers to effectively address a diverse range of operational challenges. 

40 

Our
 design, production, and support are user-centric: Our commitment to incorporating user feedback into our product development
 process is paramount. By collaborating closely with our end-users, we ensure that our product lines align with their specific needs
 and requirements. Through our expertise in drone and sensor design and our close connection with our end-users, they benefit from
 cutting-edge technologies that meets their demands across military, first responder, agriculture and surveyor sectors while leveraging
 the advantages of commercial innovation. 

We
 offer market-tested drones, sensors and system software that have earned the longstanding trust and fidelity of customers worldwide
 Through successful execution of our acquisition integration strategy in 2021, AgEagle is now delivering a unified line
 of industry trusted drones, sensors and software that have been vigorously tested and consistently proven across multiple industry
 verticals and use cases. For instance, our line of eBee fixed wing drones have flown more than one million flights over the
 past decade serving customers spanning military/defense, surveying and mapping; engineering and construction; mining, quarries and
 aggregates; agriculture; humanitarian aid and environmental monitoring, to name just a few. Featured in over 100 research publications
 globally, advanced sensor innovations developed and commercialized by AgEagle have served to forge new industry standards for high
 performance, high resolution, thermal and multispectral imaging for commercial drone applications in agriculture, plant research,
 land management and forestry. In addition, we have championed the development of end-to-end software solutions which power autonomous
 flight and deliver actionable, contextual data and analytics for numerous Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and a wide range
 of businesses in agriculture, energy and utilities, construction and other industry sectors. 

In
 August 2022, we announced that the eBee X, eBee GEO and eBee AG were the first commercial drones to be designated with
 the C2 class identification label in accordance with EASA regulations . As of August 22, 2022, drone operators flying C2 labeled
 eBee s are able to conduct missions in the Open Category with all the advantages that this entails. The C2 certification
 allows the eBee X series, with correct labelling, to fly at a horizontal distance of 30 meters from uninvolved people. By
 contrast, heavy drones like VTOLs or quadcopters must maintain a distance of 150 meters from people and any residential, commercial,
 industrial and recreational areas, limiting their operational capabilities to remote zones. 

In
 late 2022, we partnered with government contractor Darley to expand the market reach of AgEagle s high performance fixed wing
 drones and sensors to the U.S. first responder and tactical defense markets . Distinguished as one of the nation s longest
 standing government contracting organizations, Darley is expected to become a key contributor to AgEagle s success in delivering
 best-in-class UAS solutions to a wide range of state and federal agencies. Providing our best-in-class autonomous flight solutions
 for public safety applications through trusted resellers like Darley represents an entirely new market opportunity for AgEagle and
 one we intend to vigorously pursue in the current year. 

In
 December 2022, we unveiled our new eBee VISION , a small, fixed-wing UAS designed to provide real-time, enhanced
 situational awareness for critical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. This system is packaged for mobile/tactical
 users, with highly automated command and control software that proves compatible and is in full compliance with the U.S. DoD Robotic
 and Autonomous System-Air Interoperability Profile RAS-A IOP ). Beginning 2023, three branches of the European military
 have received eBee VISION drones. In collaboration with these initial end users, we ve meticulously designed the eBee VISION
 User Interface to ensure optimal usability and compatibility with commercial, professional, and NATO standards. This unique interface,
 when paired with the eBee VISION Ground Control Station, offers highly automated flight modes and precise telemetry to operators,
 enhancing overall operational efficiency and effectiveness.

AgEagle
 was awarded a Multiple Award Schedule MAS Contract by the U.S. federal government s General Services Administration
 GSA In April 2023, the centralized procurement arm of the federal government, the GSA, awarded us with a
 five-year MAS contract. The GSA Schedule Contract is a highly coveted award in the government contracting space and is the result
 of a rigorous proposal process involving the demonstration of products and services in-demand by government agencies, and the negotiation
 of their prices, qualifications, terms and conditions. Contractors selling through the GSA Contract are carefully vetted and must
 have a proven track record in the industry. We believe that this will serve to advance our efforts to achieve deeper penetration
 of the government sector over the next five years. 

In
 July 2023 alone, we completed a comprehensive training session with our first European military customers , who were confirmed
 as eBee VISION operators and qualified trainers of new users. These new customers confirmed with AgEagle s technical
 teams that all operational capabilities of the eBee VISION continue to meet and exceed performance benchmarks in scouting,
 surveillance, usability, fast deployment and flight time, among other use case criteria specified by the international military community.
 We have also been working in close collaboration with our network of valued added reselling partners in France, United Kingdom, Poland,
 Italy and Spain, among other countries, to conduct live demonstrations and technical exchanges with prospective new customers, with
 emphasis on showcasing use of eBee VISION UAS for public safety and first responder missions, border patrol and a wide range
 of commercial applications. On September 6, 2023, the Company announced that commercial production of the eBee VISION had
 commenced and orders for the systems are being accepted since then. 

In
 early October 2023, the eBee X series of drones were designated with the C6 class identification label in accordance with
 European Union regulations . As of January 1, 2024, drone operators of C6-labeled eBee s will be able to conduct BVLOS operations
 with airspace observers over a controlled ground area in a sparsely populated environment throughout Europe. Operators simply need
 to submit a required declaration with their applicable National Aviation Authority indicating whether they intend to fly missions
 in accordance with the European Standard Scenario- STS- 01 or STS-02. The inclusion of the C6 marking alongside our
 C2-labeled eBee drones will significantly enhance the market advantages for our European customers. It grants access to areas
 and operational modes restricted to drones weighing over 4 kg, all without the requirement for formal permissions or regulatory waivers.
 Currently, only eBee drones possess both the C2 and C6 marking, affirming their status as the safest choice for flying over
 people and conducting BVLOS operations. As of January 1, 2024, drone operators of C6-labeled eBee s will be able to conduct
 BVLOS operations with airspace observers over a controlled ground area in a sparsely populated environment throughout Europe. Operators

In
 March of 2024, we were selected to provide 50 RedEdge-P cameras for use by Greece s Hellenic Republic Ministry of Rural
 Development . These will be used for optimum monitoring of agricultural activity such as soil analysis, irrigation, crop quality/maturity,
 and vegetation indices, all critical to maximizing the output of agricultural products. This award serves as a continued validation
 of our product in a world focusing more and more on optimizing output for a rapidly growing population. Investment in our sensor
 product line continues, with focus on optimizing performance through introduction of new hardware and processing algorithms. 

42 

Our
 eBee X series of fixed wing UAS, including the eBee X, eBee Geo and eBee TAC ,
 were the first on the market to comply with Category 3 of the sUAS Over People rules published by the FAA . It is another important
 testament of our commitment to providing best-in-class solutions to our commercial customers, and we believe it will serve as a key
 driver in the growth of eBee utilization in the United States. We further believe it will improve the business applications
 made possible by our drone platform for a wide range of commercial enterprises which stand to benefit from adoption of drones in
 their businesses particularly those in industries such as insurance for assessment of storm damage, telecommunications for
 network coverage mapping and energy for powerline and pipeline inspections, just to name a few. 

Our
 eBee X series of drones are the world s first UAS in its class to receive design verification for BVLOS and OOP from
 European Union Aviation Safety Agency EASA ). The EASA design verification report demonstrates that the eBee
 X meets the highest possible quality and ground risk safety standards and, thanks to its lightweight design, effects of ground
 impact are reduced. As such, drone operators conducting advanced drone operations in 27 European Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein,
 Norway, and Switzerland can obtain the HIGH or MEDIUM robustness levels of the M2 mitigation without additional verification from
 EASA. Regulatory constraints relating to limitations of BVLOS and OOP have continued to be a gating factor to widespread adoption
 of commercial drone technologies across a wide range of industry sectors worldwide. Being the first company to receive this DVR from
 EASA for M2 mitigation is a milestone for AgEagle and our industry in the European Union and will be key to fueling growth of our
 international customer base. 

Impact
of the Risks and Uncertainties On Our Business Operations 

Global
economic challenges, including the impact of the war, pandemics, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, regulatory investigations
adverse labor and capital market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The aforementioned risks and their respective
impacts on the UAV industry and our operational and financial performance remain uncertain and outside of our control. Specifically,
because of the aforementioned continuing risks, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary
drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either we or any of our third parties
in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain
may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. 

Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were 3,284,984 as compared to 3,483,932 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 198,948, or 6 . The decrease of 198,948 was attributable to a decrease of approximately 685,000 revenues due to
decreased sensor sales primarily related to expected seasonality, off set by an increase of approximately 520,000 in revenues of the
 eBee drone products. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were 10,571,969 as compared to 10,819,213 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 247,244 or 2.3 . The decline in revenues is mainly attributed to the eBee drone products of 217,083 and
 75,868 of our SaaS subscription services related to our HempOverview and Ground Control platforms. Offsetting these decreases
was an increase in revenues of 45,707 attributable to the revenues derived from our sensor sales, specifically the RedEdge-P and
 Altum-PT panchromatic sensor series . Our continued innovation has demonstrated growth in our sales leading to strong demand
of our products, specifically for our panchromatic sensor series, and the VISION drone
product. 

43 

Cost
of Sales and Gross Profit 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales was 1,650,717 as compared to 2,269,858 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 619,141 or 27.3 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 1,634,267 as compared to 1,214,074
for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 420,193, or 34.6 . The primary factors contributing to the decrease in
our cost of sales and the increase gross profit margin were due to the historical inventory adjustments and new bill of material system
implementation. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales was 5,428,705 as compared to 6,594,973 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 1,166,268, or 17.7 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 5,143,264 or 49 as compared
to 4,224,240 or 39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 919,024, or 21.8 in actual gross margin. The increase
in gross profit margin was a result of our drone products along with significant price reduction in the second and third quarter of 2023
to stimulate market demand and bring us in line specifically with competitive products manufactured in China as our products become older
while awaiting the new ebee VISION.

months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,467,817 or 43.7 . The decrease was primarily related to less stock compensation expense
related to terminated employees, and the reduced stock price, less intangible amortization during 2024 due to the impairment recorded
on December 31, 2023, less shareholders annual meeting cost, offset by legal fees, accounting and consulting expense. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 6,931,496 as compared to 10,435,834 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3,504,338, or 33.6 . The decrease was primarily a result of the reduction in employee
payroll related costs due to integration of roles, ERP consulting integration costs, reduction in R D consultants, less stock compensation
costs, less intangible amortization during 2024 due to the impairment recorded on December 31, 2023, less shareholders annual meeting
costs offset by an increase in legal, accounting, consulting, and recruitment costs during 2024. 

Research
and Development 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were 969,402 as compared to 1,368,394 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 398,992, or 29.2 . The decrease was primarily due to the integration of research and development
teams that provide development of our new airframe, sensor and software technologies resulting in a reduction in our consultants and
internal headcounts. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were 3,181,638, as compared to 4,320,216 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,138,578, or 26.4 . The decrease was primarily due to the integration of research and development
teams that provide development of our new airframe, sensor and software technologies resulting in a reduction in our consultants and
internal headcounts. 

44 

Sales
and Marketing 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses were 636,292 as compared to 978,243 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 341,951, or 35 . The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in travel, integration of sales and
marketing teams that lead to a reduction of consulting expenses along with decrease in digital advertising spend as we look to attend
in-person trade shows. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses were 1,825,645 as compared to 2,911,963 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,086,318, or 37.3 . The decrease was primarily due to the integration of sales and marketing
teams, along with a decrease in consulting expenses due to branding and website integration done in prior year along with less trade-shows
offset by more in-person demos with our sales and marketing team for the new ebee VISON . 

Other
Expense, net 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, other expense, net was 1,598,594 as compared to 2,030,015 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 431,421. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense, net was 5,909,534 as compared to other expense, net of 2,887,150 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3,022,384. The increase is primarily attributable to the promissory
note s original issue discount of 4 and interest at 8 per annum issued in December 2022 along with the anti-dilution price
protections embedded in the convertible note that were triggered during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized
interest expense of 4,098,388 for the incremental fair value of the convertible note conversion feature being reduced from its
original conversion price of 0.60 to 0.4038. 

Net
Loss 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 3,459,754 as compared to a net loss of 8,020,128 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4,560,374 or 56.9 ., the decrease of the losses are related to the above mentioned reductions
of costs related to general and administrative, research and development, and sales and marketing. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 12,705,049 as compared to a net loss of 17,910,210 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 5,205,161, or 29.1 . The overall decrease in net loss was primarily attributable
to a decrease in operating costs. 

Cash
Flows 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

As
of September 30, 2024, cash on hand was 265,126, as compared to 819,024 as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 553,898, or 67.6 . 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operations was 4,056,700 a decrease of 4,772,969 or 54.1 , as compared to cash
used of 8,829,669 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was principally driven
by the lower operating expenses which included significantly lower inventory purchases and prepayments offset by higher accounts receivables,
account payables and accrued expenses. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 96,087, a decrease of 468,029, or 83 , as compared
to cash used of 564,116 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is related to the capitalization of the internal
software and platform costs incurred during 2023 which did not continue at the same rate in 2024. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 3,607,482 a decrease of 3,122,866 or 46.4 , as
compared to cash provided of 6,730,348 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by our financing
activities was due to less sales of our Common stock through an at-the-market offering and exercise of warrants in the prior year offset
by the sale of Series F Preferred stock. 

45 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 4,541,048. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss
from operations of 6,795,515, a decrease of 8,227,545, or 54.8 , as compared to 15,023,060 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. While we have historically been successful in raising capital to meet its working capital needs, the ability to continue raising
such capital to enable us to continue our growth is not guaranteed. We will require additional liquidity to continue its operations and
meet its financial obligations over the next twelve months, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We are evaluating strategies to obtain the required additional funding for future operations and the restructuring of operations to grow
revenues and reduce expenses. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

On
September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements,
including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 

Inflation 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, inflation has had a negative impact on the unmanned aerial vehicle systems industry, our customers,
and our business globally. Specifically, our ability to access components, parts and labor needed to manufacture its proprietary drones
and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third parties
in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain
may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. We expect inflation and its effects to continue
to have a significant negative impact on our business. 

Climate
Change 

Our
opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any
material effect on our operations. 

New
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ).
The ASU focuses on income tax disclosures around effective tax rates and cash income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires public business
entities to disclose, on an annual basis, a rate reconciliation presented in both dollars and percentages. The guidance requires the
rate reconciliation to include specific categories and provides further guidance on disaggregation of those categories based on a quantitative
threshold equal to 5 or more of the amount determined by multiplying pretax income (loss) from continuing operations by the applicable
statutory rate. For entities reconciling to the US statutory rate of 21 , this would generally require disclosing any reconciling items
that impact the rate by 1.05 or more. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2024 (generally, calendar year 2025) and effective for all other business entities one year later. Entities should adopt this guidance
on a prospective basis, though retrospective application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 is expected to have a financial statement
disclosure impact only and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

46 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU will now
require public entities to disclose its significant segment expenses categories and amounts for each reportable segment. Under the ASU,
a significant segment expense is an expense that is: 

significant
 to the segment, 

regularly
 provided to or easily computed from information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and 

included
 in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. 

The
ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024 (calendar year public entity will adopt the ASU in its 2024 Form 10-K). The ASU should be adopted retrospectively
unless its impracticable to do so. Early adoption of the ASU is permitted, including in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2023-07
is expected to have a financial statement disclosure impact only and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.

Evaluation
of Disclosure and Control Procedures 

The
Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
are not effective. The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is accumulated, recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure to be reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(t) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Material
Weaknesses over Financial Reporting 

During
the preparation of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified
a material weakness in our internal controls related to the computation of net loss attributable to common stockholders resulted in an
understatement of Earnings Per Share EPS). In addition to the EPS computation error, accrued dividends and deemed dividends were
included as a component of other comprehensive loss instead of being included in net loss attributable to common stockholders. 

During
the preparation of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2024, we identified a
material weakness in our internal controls related to the accounting for a complex debt transaction. Specifically, the controls
related to accounting for the modification of the convertible debt agreement. T he Company has engaged an external consultant with technical accounting expertise to help with the technical documentation and accounting of significant and unusual
transactions.
