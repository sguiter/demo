 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 Flutter Entertainment plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Ireland, qualifies as a foreign private issuer in the United States for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 The segment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker CODM reviews and manages the business. The Group determined that it is the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer jointly who are performing the function of CODM. 
 Beginning January 1, 2024, the Group revised its definition of Adjusted EBITDA, which is the segment measurement used to evaluate performance and allocate resources. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA now excludes share-based compensation as management believes inclusion of share-based compensation can obscure underlying business trends as share-based compensation could vary widely among companies due to different plans in place resulting in companies using share-based compensation awards differently, both in type and quantity of awards granted. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, subsequent to the Group s decision to close the sports betting platform FOX Bet , the Group reorganized how the PokerStars (U.S.) business is managed which resulted in a change in operating segment composition. From January 1, 2024, PokerStars (U.S.) is included in the International segment as opposed to the U.S. segment. 
 Segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, have been revised to reflect the change in operating segment measurement and change in operating segment composition. 
 The Group manages its assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment. Therefore, the CODM does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and accordingly, the Group does not report asset information by operating segment.

Certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective from January 1, 2024 and other aspects are effective from January 1, 2025. The Group does not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on its effective tax rate, however as this legislation is enacted in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of Pillar 2 become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments may increase in future years. Under U.S. GAAP, the OECD Pillar 2 rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax.

 of MaxBet, a leading omni-channel sports betting and iGaming operator in Serbia. The purchase comprised of a cash consideration of million million). 
 The share purchase agreement also includes call and put options to acquire the remaining stake. The call and put options are exercisable in 2029, commencing on the date on which the option price is determined in accordance with the terms set out in the shareholders agreement and ending on a date that is days thereafter. The options expire if neither the Group nor the non-controlling interest shareholder groups exercise the options within the option exercise period. The option price is calculated using a multiple of MaxBet s EBITDA less net debt or plus net cash, as defined in the shareholders agreement, subject to a cap calculated as billion billion) less the purchase consideration. The options can be settled, at the Group s election, in cash or freely tradable shares of Flutter. 
 The provisional fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was million which comprised of identifiable intangible assets of million consisting primarily of million of trademark and million of customer relations. The provisional measurements of fair value for certain assets and liabilities may be subject to change as additional information is received. The Group expects to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. 
 The acquisition resulted in the recognition of million goodwill on the acquisition date which has been allocated to the International segment and reporting unit. The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill (none of which is deductible for tax purposes) is the opportunity for the Group to enter the market in the Balkans region where MaxBet is one of the market leaders with an established retail and online presence. There are also tangible opportunities to deliver synergies from the acquisition of MaxBet through (i) leveraging MaxBet s retail channel to grow online deposits for existing Flutter brands and (ii) enhancing MaxBet s online capabilities by utilizing the Group s technology and marketing resources. 
 The fair value of redeemable non-controlling interest was million, which was provisionally estimated by applying a discount for lack of marketability of considering the output of the Finnerty method and a discount for lack of control of using implied discounts from observable transactions and data based on Mergerstat studies. 
 Acquisition-related costs during the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were not material and are included in the general and administrative expenses in the Group s condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). 
 Since the date of acquisition to September 30, 2024, MaxBet has contributed revenue of million and million of profit after tax to the results of the Group. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, MaxBet contributed revenue of million and million of profit after tax to the results of the Group. 
 BeyondPlay 
 On May 31, 2024, the Group completed the acquisition of of BeyondPlay for a consideration of million. The provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was million which comprised of technology intangibles of million and deferred tax liability of million. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill which has been allocated to the U.S. segment. The contribution of BeyondPlay to the revenue and profit after tax of the Group was not material. 
 Considering that the size of the acquisitions are not material, no additional pro-forma information is provided.

 million was written down to its fair value of million, in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulting in an impairment of million, which was included in sales and marketing expenses. The Group utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value. Assumptions inherent in estimating the fair value included revenue forecast, royalty rate of , income tax rate of , and discount rate of . The Group selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts of cash flows specific to the remaining useful life of the trademark using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates. Financial forecasts beyond the period covered by the plans were estimated by extrapolating the forecasts based on the plans using a steady growth in line with the long-term average growth for the countries in which the trademark is used. As the fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market, they represented Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. There were transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. 
 Valuation of Level 2 financial instruments 
 Available for sale Player deposits investments 
 The Group has determined that the fair value of available for sale player deposits investments is determined by using observable quoted prices or observable input parameters derived from comparable bonds/markets. Although the Group has determined that a number of the bonds fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, there are a class of bonds which have been classified as Level 2 due to the existence of relatively inactive trading markets for those bonds. 
 Derivative financial assets and liabilities Swap agreements 
 The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate and foreign currency risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flows of each derivative and incorporates credit valuation adjustments. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, such as yield curves, spot and forward FX rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Group assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions, determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Group determined that its valuations of its derivatives in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 Non-derivative financial instruments 
 Fox Option 
 The fair value of the Fox Option amounts to million at September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023 which was determined using an option pricing model. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the option exercise price was billion and billion, respectively. The significant unobservable inputs were the enterprise value of FanDuel, the discount for lack of marketability DLOM ), the discount for lack of control DLOC ), implied volatility and probability of Fox getting licensed. 
 The enterprise value of FanDuel was determined using an equal weight to the value indications of the discounted cash flow analysis and the guideline public company analysis. The discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis was and as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Additionally, management applied a combined discount for lack of marketability and lack of control as of September 30, 2024, and as of December 31, 2023. A range of DLOMs obtained using various securities-based approaches was to . DLOC was estimated at using implied discounts in previous observable transactions involving FanDuel s equity ownership and data based on Mergerstat studies as of September 30, 2024, and as of December 31, 2023 respectively. 
 Management selected a discount rate of , which is on the higher end of the third quartile based on the ranges considered by management. 
 The volatility was and as of September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, which was within the range of selected comparable companies. In developing the fair value measurement, the probability of a market participant submitting to and obtaining a license was estimated at as of September 30, 2024, and as of December 31, 2023. 
 Changes in discount rates, revenue multiples, DLOM, DLOC, implied volatility and probability of Fox getting licensed, each in isolation, may change the fair value of the Fox Option. Generally, an increase in discount rates and DLOM, DLOC or decrease in revenue multiples, implied volatility and probability of Fox getting licensed may result in a decrease in the fair value of the Fox Option. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of the Fox Option, the fair value of the Fox Option may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Fox Option may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for FanDuel Group LLC. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the Fox Option may cause the losses ultimately realized on the Fox Option to be different than the unrealized losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. 
 Redeemable non-controlling interests at fair value 
 The terms of symmetrical call and put options agreed between the Group and Boyd require exercise price to be calculated at fair market value without giving effect to DLOM and DLOC. FanDuel s pre-discount enterprise value determined in the same manner as discussed earlier for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is considered in measuring the fair value of redeemable non-controlling interests owned by Boyd.

 Legal Contingencies 
 The Group is involved, from time to time, in various litigation, administrative and other legal proceedings, including regulatory actions, incidental or related to its business. The Group establishes an accrued liability for legal claims and indemnification claims when the Group determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome. As additional information becomes available, the Group reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation, which may also revise our estimates. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to these matters may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued. Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, there can be no assurance that our accruals will be sufficient to cover the extent of our potential exposure to losses. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments, or settlements which might be incurred by us in connection with the various proceedings could affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Austrian and German player claims 
 As previously reported, the Group has seen a number of player claims in Austria and Germany for reimbursement of historic gaming losses. The basis of these claims is rooted in the Group having provided remote services in Austria and Germany (outside of Schleswig-Holstein) from Maltese entities on the basis of multi-jurisdictional Maltese licenses, which the Group continues to believe is compliant in accordance with EU law. However, the Austrian Courts and certain German Courts consider the Group s services non-compliant with their respective local laws. The Group strongly disputes the basis of these claims and judgements made by Austrian and German courts in awarding the player s claims. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Group expects to settle claims amounting to million million) and has recognized an accrued liability within loss contingencies forming part of other current liabilities. It is reasonably possible that the actual losses could be in excess of the Group s accrual. The Group is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of its accrual due to the complexities and uncertainty around the judicial process. In addition, there are further claims made against the Group amounting to million million) as of September 30, 2024, the settlement of which is predicated on the merits of the case and whether the enforcement proceedings are successful in laying claim over the Group s Maltese assets for settlement of these claims. The Group, based on advice from its legal counsel, believes such cross-border enforcement of judgements is in contravention to Maltese public policy and Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 and has not accrued any liability for these claims. The Group has filed countersuits before the Maltese Civil Court for setting aside these claims. The defendants have also filed garnishee orders with the Maltese Civil Court to attach the Group s Maltese assets, some of which have already been declined by the Maltese Civil Court. Should the Maltese Courts decide in favor of the Group, there would be grounds for dismissal of all pending player claims instituted against the Group. 
 While the Group believes that it has strong arguments, at this time, the Group is unable to reasonably estimate the likelihood of the outcome due to the complexities and uncertainty around the judicial process.

 Goods and Services Tax GST rate applicable to operations in India 
 As previously reported, India s Directorate General of Goods Services Tax (the DGGI is currently investigating the historical characterization of products such as rummy, fantasy games and poker as games of skill (subjects to tax of on player commission) rather than games of chance (subject to tax on player stakes). In making GST returns, Junglee and PokerStars India have consistently followed the Supreme Court of India s rulings in relation to the distinction between games of skill and games of chance. 
 The DGGI has issued notices to multiple online gaming businesses alleging historical underpayment of GST, including to the Group s operations in India (Junglee) of billion billion). Junglee disputes that any additional tax is payable and has been advised that the notice received is not in accordance with the GST provisions applicable to past periods. 
 As of the date of issue of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, Junglee has filed a petition with the Supreme Court of India, and has joined its case to the cases of other online gaming operators pending at the Supreme Court of India. The lead case (The Directorate General of GST Intelligence vs. Gameskraft Technologies Private Limited) was ruled in favor of Gameskraft, the taxpayer, at the Karnataka High Court in May 2023, and found that taxes had been paid in accordance with the law, but the case remains unresolved at the Supreme Court of India. 
 On June 22, 2024, a meeting of India s Goods and Services Tax Council (the GST Council (a constitutional body responsible for the formation and recommendation of GST law changes, held by the Supreme Court of India to be the ultimate authority on the GST issues), recommended amending the GST law to empower the Indian Central Government, on the recommendation of the GST Council, to waive any historical taxes not paid, where the common trade practice was either:

 2. to subject the goods or services to a lower tax rate than what is now being suggested by the DGGI. 
 The recommendation of the GST Council was incorporated into the Finance Act, 2024. 
 Whilst this law is not industry specific, if applied by the GST Council to be applied to the online real money gaming industry, we would expect the GST already paid on platform commissions for past periods to be accepted as the applicable tax rate and the litigation will cease. 
 As of the date of issue of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, no liability has been accrued as the Group has determined that it is not probable that a liability has been incurred considering the progress of the cases pending at the Supreme Court of India, decisions of the State High Courts in favor of the industry, the arguments of legal counsel representing the industry and the opinion of the Group s own legal counsel. 
 The Group is unable to make an estimate of any reasonably possible loss or range of losses, if any, were there to be an adverse final decision in the cases pending before the Supreme Court of India associated with the notice received. 
 Trademark and copyright claim regarding the use of the Aviator brand by Adjarabet in Georgia 
 Aviator LLC, a company owned by parties connected with the former owner of Adjarabet sued Atlas Holdings LLC, the Group's legal entity operating the Adjarabet brand in Georgia and Armenia, for damages alleging infringement of intellectual property rights in the brand name AVIATOR used within four third-party online casino games which were available on Adjarabet s website, and distributed by Spribe, which offers the game globally, and another international game provider. While management believes the claims asserted against the Group to be baseless and without merit, in August 2024, the Georgian Court of First Instance issued a judgment against Atlas Holdings LLC amounting to GEL million million), which, further, bears no resemblance or basis to the economics of the alleged infringement. 
 As of the date of issue of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, no liability has been accrued as the Group has determined that it is not probable a liability has been incurred having regard to the legal facts of the case, the status of the on-going appeal process and related ICC London arbitration proceedings and the opinion of legal counsel. The potential effects of the judgement will continue to be evaluated on an ongoing basis.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Flutter Entertainment plc and its consolidated subsidiaries in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about our business and operations. Our actual results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those we describe under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Our Business 
 Flutter is the world s leading online sports betting and iGaming operator based on revenue. Our ambition is to change our industry for the better and deliver long-term growth while also achieving a positive, sustainable future for all our stakeholders. We are well-placed to do so through the global competitive advantages of the Flutter Edge , which provides our brands with access to group-wide benefits to stay ahead of the competition, while maintaining a clear vision for sustainability through our Positive Impact Plan . 
 We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the future long-term growth of the markets we operate in. 
 Our financial growth engine is built on sustainable revenue growth, margin benefits, significant cashflow generation and disciplined capital allocation. 
 Our strategy involves expanding our Group s player base and growing player value through product innovation and efficient player incentive spend, while also increasing the efficiency of our marketing investment and operating leverage to deliver high net income margins and Adjusted EBITDA Margins. 
 We anticipate strong conversion of operation income into cash due to the scalability of our technology platforms and positive working capital from our growing business. 
 We aim to create long-term value through disciplined capital allocation, including investing in player growth and retention and acquiring top-performing local brands in high-growth markets. We intend to return to shareholders capital that cannot be effectively deployed through our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We have recently announced a share repurchase program. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information regarding the share repurchase program. 
 The combination of margin benefits, cashflow generation and disciplined capital allocation is expected to drive earnings per share growth and long-term value creation. 
 
 Our Products and Geographies 
 Our principal products include sportsbook, iGaming and other products, such as exchange betting, pari- mutuel wagering and daily fantasy sports DFS ). In each market that we operate in, we typically offer sports betting, iGaming, or both, depending on the regulatory conditions of that market. 
 We operate a divisional management and operating structure across our geographic markets. Each division has an empowered management team responsible for maintaining the momentum and growth in their respective geographic markets. Our divisions are: (i) U.S., (ii) UKI, (iii) International and (iv) Australia, which align with our four reportable segments. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, subsequent to our decision to close the sports betting platform FOX Bet, we reorganized how the PokerStars (U.S.) business is managed which resulted in a change in operating segment composition. From January 1, 2024, PokerStars (U.S.) is included in the International segment as opposed to the U.S. segment. 
 Beginning January 1, 2024, the Group revised its definition of Adjusted EBITDA, which is the segment measure used to evaluate performance and allocate resources. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA now excludes share-based compensation as management believes inclusion of share-based compensation can obscure underlying business trends as share-based compensation could vary widely among companies due to different plans in place resulting in companies using share-based compensation awards differently, both in type and quantity of awards granted. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, have been revised to reflect the change in operating segment measurement and change in operating segment composition. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We report our financial results in this quarterly report in accordance with U.S. GAAP; however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information to supplement our financial operating performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, both on a Group-wide basis, provide visibility to the performance of our business by excluding the impact of certain income or gains and expenses or losses. Additionally, we believe these metrics are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and others in our industry in evaluating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a liquidity measure and should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business, or to distribute to shareholders, or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 To evaluate our business properly and prudently, we encourage you to review the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and not rely on a single financial measure to evaluate our business. We also strongly urge you to review the reconciliations between our most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP measures and our non-GAAP measures set forth in Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. 
 
 Key Operational Metrics 
 Average Monthly Players AMPs is defined as the average over the applicable reporting period of the total number of players who have placed and/or wagered a stake and/or contributed to rake or tournament fees during the month. This measure does not include individuals who have only used new player or player retention incentives, and this measure is for online players only and excludes retail player activity. We present AMPs for each of our product categories, for each of our divisions and for the consolidated Group as a whole as we believe this provides useful information for assessing underlying trends. At the product category level, a player is generally counted as one AMP for each product category they use. In circumstances where a player uses multiple product categories within one brand, we are generally able to identify that it is the same player who is using multiple product categories and therefore count this player as only one AMP at each of the division and Group levels while also counting this player as one AMP for each separate product category that the player is using. 
 Notwithstanding the methodology described in the immediately preceding paragraph, our AMPs information is based on player data collected by each of our brands, which generally each employ their own unique data platform, and reflects a level of duplication that arises from individuals who use multiple brands. More specifically, we are generally unable to identify when the same individual player is using multiple brands and therefore count this player multiple times. In addition to the duplication that arises when the same individual player is using multiple brands, we do not eliminate from the AMPs information presented for the Group as a whole duplication of individual players who use our product offerings in multiple divisions. For example, a player who uses Betfair Casino in the iGaming product category within the UKI division and Betfair Exchange in the other product category within the International division would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the iGaming product category and the other product category and would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the UKI division and the International division; however, this player would count as two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the Group as a whole. 
 We are unable to quantify the level of duplication that arises as a result of these circumstances, but do not believe it to be material and note that players must demonstrate residency within the geography covered by a division to sign up for an account, and accordingly such duplication could only arise in the circumstance of an individual player having multiple residences across different divisions. For a further description of the duplication that can arise in the way we count AMPs, see Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Annual Report. We do not believe that the existence of player duplication undercuts the meaningfulness of the AMPs data that we present for assessing underlying trends in our business, and our management uses this AMPs data for this purpose.

Table of Contents 

 Stakes represent the total amount our players wagered in sportsbook and is a key volume indicator for our sportsbook products. The variability of sporting outcomes can result in an impact to sportsbook revenue that may obscure underlying trends in the sportsbook business relating to growth in amounts wagered and, accordingly, staking data can provide additional useful information. We do not utilize staking information to track performance of our iGaming products. Because our iGaming business is not subject to the same variability in outcomes, management is able to assess trends in our iGaming business by analyzing AMPs and revenue changes, without the need to collect or analyze stakes and believes that collecting and analyzing stakes data in our iGaming business would not provide meaningful incremental information regarding trends in such business that is not already provided by collecting and analyzing our iGaming AMPs and revenue data. 
 Sportsbook net revenue margin is defined as sportsbook revenue as a percentage of the amount staked. This is a key indicator for measuring the combined impact of our overall margin on sportsbook products and levels of bonusing. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 In January 2024, we acquired an initial 51 controlling stake in MaxBet, a leading omni-channel sports betting and gaming operator in Serbia. The purchase comprised of a cash consideration of 143 million 131 million). The share purchase agreement also includes call and put options to acquire the remaining 49 stake in 2029. 
 In September 2024, we announced two strategic acquisitions: a 56 interest in NSX Group, a leading Brazilian operator of the Betnacional brand for a cash consideration of approximately 364 million (Brazilian Real 1,981 million) subject to customary completion accounts adjustments with a redemption mechanism in the form of call and put options which allows us to acquire the remaining interest in year five and year ten following the completion date, and 100 stake of Snaitech S.p.A., one of Italy s leading omni-channel operators for a cash consideration of 2.6 billion 2.3 billion). We expect these acquisitions to be complete in 2025. Both acquisitions fully align with our strategy to invest in leadership positions in international markets and will expand our reach in the attractive markets of Brazil and Italy. 
 We intend to continue to make similar investments in the future in attractive, fast-growing markets where growing our business organically is typically slower or more difficult to achieve. Acquisitions can involve significant investments to integrate the business of the acquired company with our business, and such costs may vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, the impact of significant acquisitions may result in our financial information for such periods being less comparable to prior financial periods, or not being comparable at all, to prior financial periods. 
 
 Business Environment 
 The global online betting and gaming market is currently expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 8.0 between 2024 and 2030, primarily driven by further migration to online channels and the increase in the number of regulated markets across the world. The expected regulation in the next two years of markets such as Canada, as well as additional states in the United States, have the potential to increase the international addressable market. The performance of our four reportable segments can be materially affected by these industrial trends and regulatory changes in the global online sports betting and iGaming market. 
 U.S. 
 Our U.S. segment is considered to be the largest growth opportunity for the Group. Since 2018 when the key gambling legislation was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, a number of states have moved to legalize and regulate gambling at the state level. As of September 30, 2024, FanDuel is active in 23 states that have legalized and regulated for a competitive online sports betting market and 5 states that have legalized and regulated iGaming. Effective from July 1, 2024, the state of Illinois increased its tax rates on online sports betting. On August 13, 2024, we announced we expect a 50 million impact in U.S. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ending December 31, 2024 before any mitigating actions due to this increase. However, certain mitigation actions including optimization of player incentives and media spend are expected to have an approximate 10 million impact resulting in an expected net U.S. Adjusted EBITDA impact of 40 million for the six months ending December 31, 2024. No other states have advanced similar legislation. 
 UKI 
 While more mature and developed than many other European markets, the United Kingdom and Ireland online gaming and betting markets have continued to exhibit good levels of growth despite the introduction of safer gambling initiatives by operators in those markets and regulatory changes in Great Britain.

Table of Contents 

 In recent years, regulatory changes and the introduction of safer gambling initiatives by operators in the United Kingdom have led to slightly slower market growth. On February 23, 2024, the UK government announced plans to introduce a statutory maximum stake limit for online slot games of 5 per spin for adults aged 25 and over (with effect from September 2024) and 2 per spin for young adults aged 18 to 24 (with effect from six weeks after the 5 per spin limit is implemented). On May 1, 2024, the Gambling Commission of Great Britain published the outcome of a number of consultations arising from the UK Government s white paper reviewing gambling legislation from April 2023, including in respect of financial vulnerability checks, financial risk assessments, and direct marketing to consumers. On April 27, 2023, the Group announced it estimated that the incremental revenue impact from the proposed measures announced in the white paper could be between 50 million and 100 million from our UKI business per annum. 
 International 
 Our International division operates in over 100 different countries in both regulated and unregulated markets with select markets discussed below. 
 Italy is the largest regulated gambling market in the European Union, with its online penetration expected to stand at 23.0 based on GGR in 2024, which represents an opportunity for Italian online betting and gaming to further grow given the under-penetration in this market. 
 In recent years, the regulatory framework in Italy has tightened with a ban on online advertising issued in 2019 and a temporary (2 year) increase in taxes on gross winnings from sports betting to finance Italian sport during the Covid pandemic. In August 2023, the Italian government approved the terms of a new decree to reorganize the entire gambling sector with the primary objective of improving player protection, combating illegal gambling and increasing tax revenues through a new licensing framework. The first operational step was the approval of a decree in March 2024 to initiate the reorganization of the online sector through the issuing of a new call for tenders, for new online gaming licenses expected by the first quarter of 2025. A significant amount of interest in the Italian market is anticipated, with at least 50 requests from operators expected to seek these new licenses. These licenses will be valid for nine years and will cover all games that are not subject to exclusive licenses, such as online scratch cards. The new licenses are scheduled to start in third quarter of 2025. Groups, such as Flutter, can hold a maximum of five licenses. At present, the Group does not expect a significant impact from these regulatory changes, given its reduced dependence on online advertising, its scale advantage and its retail presence in Italy. Additionally, bids for the tender of Italian Lotto are expected to be submitted by the end of 2024. Italian Lotto is current managed by Lottoitalia s.r.l. Lottoitalia ), a joint venture company among IGT Lottery S.p.A., Italian Gaming Holding a.s., Arianna 2001 (an entity associated with the Federation of Italian Tobacconists), and Novomatic Italia. 
 Among the international markets in which we operate, Turkey, India, Georgia, Serbia and Spain are our five largest markets after Italy. Collectively we believe the addressable market which we have access to across India, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, Turkey and North Africa will represent approximately 40-50 billion in gross gaming revenue by 2030. 
 In addition, Brazil is in the process of regulating online sports betting and casino with the launch of the regulated market expected on January 1, 2025. We have applied for a license to the Brazilian regulator. 
 Australia 
 The Australian betting and gaming market is regulated with online betting and gaming accounting for 26 of the market in 2023. In recent years, the Australian market has benefitted from customer migration to online channels, accelerated by COVID-19 related restrictions in 2020 and 2021. However, the market has experienced a softer racing market due to the softened consumer demand post COVID-19, which is expected to continue in the near term, while the sports segment of the market has shown continued growth. 
 The regulatory environment in Australia has also evolved significantly in recent years, especially after the introduction of point of consumption tax in 2019. Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory have since increased point of consumption tax rates. Victoria is the most recent state to announce an increase in the point of consumption tax rate (from 10 to 15 ), effective from July 1, 2024. The higher tax environment underlines the importance of scale in the Australian market and favors large operators, as increasing regulatory and tax hurdles can drive out smaller operators and support market share expansion for scale operators.

 1. In circumstances where a player uses multiple product categories within one brand, we are generally able to identify that it is the same player who is using multiple product categories and therefore count this player as only one AMP at the Group level while also counting this player as one AMP for each separate product category that the player is using. As a result, the sum of the AMPs presented at the product category level presented above is greater than the total AMPs presented at the Group level. AMPs presented above reflects a level of duplication that arises from individuals who use multiple brands or use product offerings in multiple divisions. See Key Operational Metrics above for additional information regarding how we calculate AMPs data, including a discussion regarding duplication of players that exists in such data.

 Our revenue increased by 27 , to 3,248 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2,558 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and our AMPs increased 16 period on period to 12.9 million. The key drivers of Group revenue growth were (i) continued strong online revenue growth of our U.S. segment, with revenue increasing by 51 period on period and a positive start to the new National Football League NFL season in the U.S. including new product launches and the benefit of favorable sports results, (ii) UKI revenue growth of 18 following a strong conclusion to the European Football Championships Euros ), positive sports results and excellent momentum in iGaming, and (iii) a strong International performance particularly in Sisal. T he addition of MaxBet also added 2 to total Group revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The impact of sports results which is calculated as the difference between our expected net revenue margin for the period and our actual net revenue margin had approximately a 4 positive impact on total revenue growth for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cost of sales increased by 26 , to 1,752 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,386 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, in line with the increase in revenue. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue remained consistent period on period at 54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 54 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Technology, research and development e xpenses remained consistent period on period at 213 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 214 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 7 to 748 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 701 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to investment in player acquisition in the U.S. at the start of the NFL season . S ales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 400 basis points from 27 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by significant economies of scale achieved in existing states with continued disciplined player acquisition investment in the United States partly offset by new state launches. 
 General and administrative expense increased by 11 , to 438 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 394 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in labor cost due to greater investment in our workforce, which was partially offset by a 18 million credit from a historic legal case. 
 Operating profit (loss) increased by 234 million to 97 million operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 137 million operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the factors above. 
 Other expense, net increased by 78 million, to a 122 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from a 44 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . This increase was primarily driven by (i) the impact of a fair value loss of 121 million on the Fox Option liability for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a fair value gain of 18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and (ii) a fair value loss on derivative instruments of 25 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 19 million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by a foreign exchange gain of 31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a foreign exchange loss of 80 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net increased by 13 million, to 105 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 92 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the issuance of 525 million aggregate principal amount of USD-denominated senior secured notes due 2029 (the USD Notes and 500 million aggregate principal amount of EUR-denominated senior secured notes due 2029 (the EUR Notes and, together with the USD Notes, the Notes in April 2024. 
 Income tax benefit increased by 5 million, to a 16 million income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from a 11 million income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The movement is primarily due to the change in amount and jurisdictional mix of profits in which the Group has a taxable presence, as well as the tax impact of discrete adjustments. 
 Net loss decreased by 148 million, or 56 , to 114 million net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from a net loss of 262 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and net loss margin decreased to 3.5 from 10.2 net loss margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the factors above.

 Adjusted EBITDA increased by 74 , to 450 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 258 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 380 basis points from 10.1 to 13.9 reflecting the revenue performance and expenses trend outlined above. 
 Operational and Financial Metrics by Segment 
 U.S. 
 The following table presents a summary of our operational metrics for the U.S. segment for the interim periods indicated. 
 Three months ended September 30, AMPs (Amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Total U.S. AMPs 1

 10,037 7,378 Sportsbook net revenue margin 8.2 6.9 
 1. Total U.S. AMPs is not a sum total of the AMPs for each product category because in circumstances where a player uses multiple product categories within one brand, we are generally able to identify that it is the same player who is using multiple product categories and therefore count this player as only one AMP at the U.S. division level while also counting this player as one AMP for each separate product category that the player is using. As a result, the sum of the AMPs presented at the product category level presented above is greater than the total AMPs presented at the U.S. division level. AMPs presented above reflects a level of duplication that arises from individuals who use multiple brands or use product offerings in multiple divisions. See Key Operational Metrics above for additional information regarding how we calculate AMPs data, including a discussion regarding duplication of players that exists in such data. 
 The following table presents our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the U.S. segment for the interim periods indicated.

 Total revenue for our U.S. segment increased by 51 to 1,250 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 828 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting AMPs growth of 28 . Sportsbook revenue increased by 62 , with amounts staked up 36 to 10,037 million and AMPs 31 higher at 2.6 million due to our strong growth across both new and existing states . Sportsbook net revenue margin increased to 8.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This reflected continued expansion of our expected sportsbook net revenue margin, driven by our market leading product offering and pricing capabilities. We also benefited from a 120 basis points of favorable impact from favorable sports results compared with the prior period (sports results for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 80 basis points favorable; for the three months ended September 30, 2023: 40 basis points unfavorable). 
 iGaming revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 46 driven by an increase in AMPs of 43 period on period to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This reflected our focus on exclusive content such as the next in our Wonka series and Pure Imagination , and market leading generosity continuing to drive customer strong direct casino and cross-sell customer engagement.

These improvements were driven by (i) an increase in revenue as a result of the factors above, (ii) lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenue primarily driven by the positive sports results benefit, which was partly offset by the impact of the Illinois tax increase from July 1, 2024 and (iii) significant economies of scale achieved in sales and marketing expenses through ongoing operating leverage in our earlier-to-regulate states. These improvements were partially offset by increases in technology, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses reflecting the investment to scale our product and technology capabilities.

 1. Total UKI AMPs is not a sum total of the AMPs for each product category because in circumstances where a player uses multiple product categories within one brand, we are generally able to identify that it is the same player who is using multiple product categories and therefore count this player as only one AMP at the UKI division level while also counting this player as one AMP for each separate product category that the player is using. As a result, the sum of the AMPs presented at the product category level presented above is greater than the total AMPs presented at the UKI division level. AMPs presented above reflects a level of duplication that arises from individuals who use multiple brands or use product offerings in multiple divisions. See Key Operational Metrics above for additional information regarding how we calculate AMPs data, including a discussion regarding duplication of players that exists in such data.

 Sportsbook revenue increased by 9 to 356 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 326 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly driven by a positive conclusion to the Euros, which accounted for 8 of sportsbook stakes in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Sportsbook net revenue margin increased 80 basis points to 12.4 , benefited from 60 basis points of favorable sports results period on period (sports results for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 40 basis points favorable; for the three months ended September 30, 2023: 20 basis points unfavorable). 
 iGaming revenue increased 29 , to 454 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 351 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by AMP growth of 17 , from the continuous product improvements being delivered across the iGaming portfolio and strong cross-sell from sportsbook. 
 Other revenue decreased by 14 , to 36 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 42 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the Betfair Exchange.

 Total revenue for our International segment increased by 15 to 781 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 679 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 14 increase in AMPs. Revenue in our Consolidate and Invest ma rke ts grew 20 reflecting (i) the acquisition of MaxBet in January 2024, which contributed 50 million in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and (ii) strong revenue growth in Italy (+13 ), Turkey (+34 ), Georgia (+17 ), Armenia (+14 and Spain (+4 ). This growth helped to mitigate the revenue decline in India (-17 due to the impact of tax changes introduced in the three months ended December 31, 2023. 
 Sportsbook revenue increased by 31 to 160 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 122 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was mainly due to the stakes increase of 36 to 1,421 million driven by strong revenue growth in Italy including the benefit of the Euros. There was a decrease in sportsbook net revenue margin of 40 basis points to 11.3 due to a lower proportion of wagers coming from Sisal's higher revenue margin retail business. Sport results were less unfavorable by 10 basis points period on period (three months ended September 30, 2024: 60 basis points unfavorable impact; three months ended September 30, 2023: 70 basis points unfavorable impact). 
 iGaming revenue increased by 11 to 589 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 531 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , mainly due to the addition of MaxBet.

 Our revenue increased by 21 , to 10,256 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 8,477 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and our AMPs grew 15 period on period to 13.7 million. The key drivers of Group revenue growth were (i) continued strong online revenue growth of our U.S. segment, with revenue 40 higher period on period, d espite sports results which were less favorable in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the prior period, (ii strong UKI iGaming and sportsbook growth driving increase in UKI revenue by 17 including the benefit of favorable sports results period on period and (iii) a strong International performance particularly in Italy and the addition of Maxbet which added 1 to total Group revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The impact of sports results which is calculated as the difference between our expected net revenue margin for the period and our actual net revenue margin had an approximately 2 p o sitive impact on total revenue growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by revenue decline of 2 in Australia due to the softer racing market in the period. 
 Cost of sales increased by 22 , to 5,380 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4,418 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in line with the increase in revenue. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased period on period at 52.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 52.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Technology, research and development expenses increased by 11 , to 619 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 558 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by continued investment in product development to enhance the customer proposition of our brands across the Group and increased labor costs as we are scaling our business in the U.S.. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 6 , to 2,375 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2,250 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 23.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 330 basis points from 26.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by (i) significant economies of scales achieved in existing states with continued disciplined player acquisition investment in the United States partly offset by new state launches and (ii) increasingly targeted investment in the Consolidate and Invest markets, as well as the closure of FOX Bet in August 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 9 , to 1,292 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,181 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily as a result of (i) the continued expansion of our U.S. business; (ii) advisory fees related to activities associated with the change in the primary listing of the Group; and (iii) an increase in labor cost due to greater investment in the Group s workforce. 
 Operating profit increased by 520 million from a profit of 70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to a profit of 590 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the factors above. 
 Other expense, net increased by 128 million, to 207 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by (i) an increase in the fair value loss of 115 million on the Fox Option liability period on period; and (ii) a decrease in the fair value gain on derivative instruments of 35 million period on period partially offset by a foreign exchange gain of 30 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net increased by 59 million, to 325 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 266 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the issuance of 525 million aggregate principal amount of USD Notes and 500 million aggregate principal amount of EUR Notes in April 2024. 
 Income tax expense increased by 18 million, to 52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 34 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The movement is primarily due to the change in amount and jurisdictional mix of profits in which the Group has a taxable presence, as well as the tax impact of discrete adjustments.

The unfavorable sports results during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily in Sisal, led to a 100 basis point unfavorable impact from sports results period on period (nine months ended September 30, 2024: 40 basis points unfavorable impact; nine months ended September 30, 2023: 60 basis points favorable impact). 
 iGaming revenue increased by 9 to 1,763 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,624 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the addition of MaxBet and strong AMP growth. 
 Other revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 25 driven by the new concession in Morocco and Betfair Exchange. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for International was 481 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 68 million increase from 413 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 110 basis points to 20.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were primarily driven by (i) the increase in revenue as a result of the factors above; (ii) cost savings from the closure of FOX Bet in August 2023 and the optimization of the PokerStars business model; and (iii) a one-off credit of 18 million from a historic legal case.

 The following table presents our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the Australia segment for the interim periods indicated.

 Australia revenue decreased by 2 to 1,049 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,072 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with AMPs increasing by 4 , to 1.1 million in the period, due to strong engagement on key sports events including the Rugby League State of Origin games during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in sportsbook revenue was driven by a 12 decrease in amounts staked to 7,956 million in for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to continued softer racing market environment, in line with expectations, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was partly offset by that the sportsbook net revenue margin increased by 130 basis points to 13.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by a continued expansion in our structural revenue margin and favorable sports results (nine months ended September 30, 2024: 90 basis points favorable impact; nine months ended September 30, 2023: nil basis points impac t). 
 Adjusted EBITDA for Australia was 229 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 11 decrease from 256 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 210 basis points to 21.8 . The period-on-period movement reflected the decrease in revenue as a result of the factors above. 
 
 Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined on a Group basis as income (loss) before income taxes; other expense, net; interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; transaction fees and associated costs; restructuring and integration costs; impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets, and share-based compensation charge. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures and should not be viewed as measures of overall operating performance, indicators of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as alternatives to operating profit (loss) or net income (loss) measures, or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity, or as alternatives to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 These non-GAAP measures are presented solely as supplemental disclosures to reported GAAP measures because we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results and these measures are widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as measures of performance. Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin when evaluating operating performance because we believe that they provide additional perspective on the financial performance of our core business. 
 Beginning January 1, 2024, the Group revised its definition of Adjusted EBITDA, which is the segment measurement used to evaluate performance and allocate resources. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA now excludes share-based compensation as management believes inclusion of share-based compensation can obscure underlying business trends because share-based compensation could vary widely among companies due to different plans in place resulting in companies using share-based compensation awards differently, both in type and quantity of awards granted. 
 In presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, the Group excludes certain items as explained below: 
 Transaction fees and associated costs and restructuring and integration costs, which include charges for discrete projects or transactions that significantly change our operations, are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. 
 Other expense, net is excluded because it is not indicative of our core operating performance.

Table of Contents 

 Share-based compensation expense is excluded as this could vary widely among companies due to different plans in place resulting in companies using share-based compensation awards differently, both in type and quantity of awards granted. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are unaudited and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance. In addition, other companies in the betting and gaming industry that report Adjusted EBITDA may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner and such differences may be material. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have further limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: 
 they do not reflect the Group s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; 
 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group s working capital needs; 
 they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Group s debt; 
 they do not reflect shared-based compensation expense, which is primarily a non-cash charge that is part of our employee compensation; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 
 they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group s statements of cash flows; and 
 the further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are those that management consider not to be representative of the underlying operations of the Group and therefore are subjective in nature. 
 The following table reconciles net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for th e fiscal quarters presented:

Comprises advisory fees related to implementation of internal controls, information system changes and other strategic advisory related to the change in the primary listing of the Group for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 transaction fees and associated costs comprised advisory fees related to the proposed listing of Flutter s ordinary shares in the U.S.. 
 2. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, costs of 42 million and 87 million (three and nine months ended September 30, 2023: 28 million and 75 million) primarily relate to various restructuring and other strategic initiatives to drive synergies. The programs are expected to run until 2027. These actions include efforts to consolidate and integrate our technology infrastructure, back-office functions and relocate certain operations to lower cost locations. It also includes business process re-engineering cost, planning and design of target operating models for the Group's enabling functions and discovery and planning related to the Group's anticipated migration to a new enterprise resource planning system. The costs primarily include severance expenses, advisory fees and temporary staffing cost. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and borrowings from various financial institutions and debt investors. We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service our long-term debt, our obligations under our operating leases, and to repurchase our ordinary shares subject to economic and market conditions and our capital requirements, and otherwise as described below under Other Purchase Obligations. We believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements in the short term and long term by using available cash, internally generated funds and borrowings under the Group s 1 billion committed revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,483 million of cash and cash equivalents available for corporate use. 
 Credit Agreement First Incremental Assumption Agreement 
 On March 14, 2024, the Group entered into the First Incremental Assumption Agreement (the Assumption Agreement to the TLA/TLB/RCF Agreement dated as of November 24, 2023 (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). After giving effect to the Assumption Agreement, the aggregate principal amount of Term B loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement increased by 514 million (the First Incremental Term B Loans ), which is fungible with the existing Term B loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the First Incremental Term B Loans were used to refinance the USD First Lien Term Loan B due 2028. As the terms of First Incremental Term B Loans are not substantially different from those of the original USD First Lien Term Loan B due 2028, the refinance was treated as continuation of the original debt instrument for accounting purposes. 
 Following repayment of the EUR First Lien Term Loan B due 2026 and the USD First Lien Term Loan B due 2028, the facilities under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest (subject to permitted liens) (x) in respect of obligors organized or incorporated outside of the United States, over the shares held by an obligor in another obligor and (y) in respect of obligors organized or incorporated in the United States, substantially all of our assets (subject to certain exceptions), in each case, in accordance with the Agreed Guarantee and Security Principles (as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 On April 29, 2024, the Group issued 525 million aggregate principal amount of USD-denominated 6.375 senior secured notes due 2029 (the USD Notes and 500 million aggregate principal amount of EUR-denominated 5.000 senior secured notes due 2029 (the EUR Notes and, together with the USD Notes, the Notes ), each issued at 100 of their nominal value, by its subsidiary Flutter Treasury DAC. The Group used the proceeds of the notes to repay the EUR First Lien Term Loan B due 2026 under the existing syndicated facility agreement dated July 10, 2018, to repay the borrowings under the existing multi-currency revolving credit facility, and pay certain costs, fees and expenses in connection with the offering of the Notes.

 Amended and Restated Commitment Letter 
 On October 23, 2024, the Group entered into an amended and restated commitment letter originally dated September 12, 2024 with certain banks to obtain binding commitments in respect of a senior secured first lien term loan comprising an aggregate Euro principal of 2.5 billion (the Facility to fund, among others, the strategic acquisition of Snaitech S.p.A which was announced by the Group in September 2024. If implemented, the Facility will (i) mature 12 months from first utilization of the Facility, subject to an extension option of six months which can be exercised twice and (ii) bear interest at a per annum rate equal to EURIBOR (provided that in no event shall EURIBOR be less than 0.00 plus an applicable margin equal to 1.25 per annum, subject to an increase of 0.20 per annum on the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the second complete quarter following first utilization of the Facility. The increase shall be 0.40 per annum instead of 0.20 per annum from the date being twelve calendar months after first utilization of the Facility. The other terms of Facility will be on substantially similar terms to that of the Credit Agreement dated as of November 24, 2023 between, among others, certain members of the Group and the lenders named therein. 
 Long-term Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of long-term debt of 7 billion, with 39 million due within 12 months. In addition we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of September 30, 2024, our total interest obligation on long-term debt totaled 445 million payable within 12 months net of hedging. Actual future interest payments may differ from these amounts based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. Excluded from these amounts are other costs related to indebtedness. 
 Leases 
 We have lease arrangements primarily for offices, retail stores and data centers. As of September 30, 2024, the Group had operating lease obligations of 567 million with 130 million payable within 12 months. 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 On September 25, 2024, our Board authorized a share repurchase program (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program of up to 5 billion of our ordinary shares, over the next three to four years. No repurchase had been made as of September 30, 2024. The timing and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, economic and market conditions and our capital requirements. We may from time to time in the future repurchase shares on the open market on a case by case basis or on a non-discretionary basis pursuant to a plan or in any other manner designed to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, by effecting a tender offer, through the purchase of call options or the sale of put options, or otherwise, or by any combination of the foregoing. 
 We intend to enter into 10b5-1 plan with a broker to effect repurchases of up to an aggregate of 350 million ordinary shares during the period from November 14, 2024 through March 31, 2025. A further announcement will be made in due course. 
 Other Purchase Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations relating to sponsorship agreements, marketing agreements and media agreements aggregated 3,109 million, with 417 million payable in the remainder of 2024. Capital expenditure commitments contracted for but not yet incurred as of September 30, 2024, was 52 million.

Table of Contents 

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 404 million, to 950 million compared to 546 million cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The improvement in our cash flows from operating activities was primarily driven by (i) an improvement in our operating profit, (ii) a cash inflow of 97 million from player deposits in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus a cash outflow of 406 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven largely by a payment of lottery winnings by Sisal in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was at a high point as of December 31, 2022, due to the rollover of the lottery jackpot, (iii) income tax payments of 178 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 209 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 offset by (iv) a payment of 213 million on settlement of derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with a receipt of 215 million on maturity of derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and (v) an increase in cash outflow on accounts payable due to a decrease in the time lag between receipt of invoices and payments, and a decrease in cash inflow on accounts receivable. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 there was an improvement in the time lag between invoicing of accounts receivable and collection. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 264 million, or 69 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 647 million compared to 383 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by cash payments of purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, for acquiring MaxBet and BeyondPlay and an increase in capital expenditure. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 244 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 409 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by repurchase of ordinary shares and acquisition of non-controlling interest in th e nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in proceeds from issue of ordinary shares upon exercise of options in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 offset by an increase in net repayment of long-term debt and dividends distributed to non-controlling interests in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 
 Fox Option liability 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes to the fair value measurement approach for the Fox Option as discussed in the 2023 Annual Report. For the input of subjective assumptions used in the option pricing model, please see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 Changes in assumptions, each in isolation, may change the fair value of the Fox Option liability. Generally, a decrease in the equity value of the investor units, volatility and the probability of FOX getting licensed and an increase in DLOM and DLOC may result in a decrease in the fair value of the Fox Option. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of the Fox Option liability, the fair value of the Fox Option liability may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Fox Option liability may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for FanDuel. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the Fox Option may cause the losses ultimately realized on the Fox Option to be different than the unrealized losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. The range in fair value as of September 30, 2024, is 113 million to 2,217 million, assuming a 10 increase/decrease in the equity value of the investor units and us ing the upper and lower end of the ranges of volatility, DLOC and DLOM, as disclosed in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 There have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as previously identified in our 2023 Annual Report that were not remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 Remediation of Material Weaknesses 
 We continue to implement our remediation plans that address the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as previously discussed in Part II, Item 9A of our 2023 Annual Report. The remaining remediation work involves (i) ensuring full segregation of duties, (ii) training of finance and technology colleagues to ensure they fully understand their responsibilities regarding the performance and evidencing of key controls over financial reporting and the escalation of any issues or deficiencies in a timely manner, (iii) the re-designing of key controls and (iv) implementing processes to ensure our reporting is fully compliant with GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. It will also be necessary to further upgrade our processes over user access and change management for key systems that support financial reporting and to employ additional resources to ensure that the re-designed control environment can operate effectively and in a sustainable way. The implementation of our remediation measures will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period. We will not consider the material weaknesses remediated until our enhanced controls are operational for a sufficient period of time and tested, enabling management to conclude that the enhanced controls are operating effectively. In addition, we cannot ensure that the measures taken by us to date, and actions that we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate these deficiencies or that they will prevent or avoid potential future deficiencies. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We are taking actions to remediate the material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting, as described above. Except as otherwise described herein, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are, and from time to time may become, subject to litigation and various legal proceedings, including litigation and proceedings related to competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, advertising practices, labor and employment, commercial disputes and services, as well as shareholder derivative suits, class action lawsuits, actions from former employees, suits involving governmental authorities and other matters, that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. Please see Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report other than those listed in this section. 
 The risks described in our 2023 Annual Report and in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our ordinary shares and will diminish our cash reserves. 
 The amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of long-term debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to 5 billion of our outstanding ordinary shares, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any ordinary shares. 
 
 We cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the ordinary shares under our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our ordinary share and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our ordinary share. In addition, this program is a use of cash, which may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, dividends, or repayment of indebtedness.
