The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to the Company's. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the "Administrator"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct the Company's day-to-day operations. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 The Company conducted a private offering (the "Private Offering") of units of the Company's limited liability company interests (the "Units") to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Units will be offered for subscription continuously throughout the Closing Period (as defined below). Each investor in the Private Offering made a capital commitment (each, a "Capital Commitment") to purchase Units pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with the Company (each, a "Subscription Agreement"). The Company expects closings of the Private Offering will occur, from time to time, in the Investment Adviser's sole discretion, during the -month period following the initial closing of Capital Commitments, which occurred on May 4, 2022 (the "Closing Period"). On April 15, 2024, pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended and restated on December 6, 2023 (the "Third A R LLC Agreement"), the Investment Adviser elected to extend the Closing Period from months to months after the initial closing of the Private Offering. As a result of the foregoing, the Company extended the end of the period during which it may hold subsequent closings from May 4, 2024 to November 4, 2024. The Company may accept and draw down on Capital Commitments from investors throughout the Closing Period and may draw down on Capital Commitments after the Closing Period. The Company commenced loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial drawdown from investors in the Private Offering, which occurred on May 9, 2022 (the "Initial Drawdown"). The "Investment Period" began on May 4, 2022 and will continue until November 4, 2028, the anniversary of the end of the Closing Period. The term of the Company is until November 4, 2030, from the end of the Closing Period, subject to (i) a extension as determined by the Investment Adviser in its sole discretion and (ii) an additional extension as determined by the Company's board of directors. 
 The Company established New Mountain Guardian IV SPV, L.L.C. GIV SPV on July 26, 2022 as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, whose assets are used to secure GIV SPV's credit facility. The Company established New Mountain Guardian IV Holdings, L.L.C. ("GIV Holdings"), formerly known as New Mountain Guardian IV Issuer SPV, L.L.C., on October 28, 2022 as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, whose assets are used to secure GIV Holdings' credit facility. The Company established New Mountain Guardian IV Panzura, Inc. ("GIV Panzura") and New Mountain Guardian IV PPP, Inc. ("GIV PPP") as wholly-owned direct subsidiaries, which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are intended to facilitate the Company's compliance with the requirements to be treated as a RIC under the Code by holding equity or equity-like investments in certain of the Company's portfolio companies that are organized as a limited liability company or other form of pass-through entity. The Company consolidates GIV Panzura and GIV PPP for accounting purposes, but the corporations are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may incur U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. 
 The Company focuses on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. upper middle market companies backed by top private equity sponsors. The Company's investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of senior secured loans and select junior capital positions to growing businesses in defensive industries that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company's differentiated investment approach leverages the deep sector knowledge and operating resources of New Mountain Capital.

 and . The Company focuses on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams. 
 Senior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. The Company invests a significant portion of its portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt. Certain unitranche loan investments may include "last-out" positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. In some cases, the Company s investments may also include equity interests. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's top five industry concentrations were software, business services, healthcare, financial services and consumer services.

 Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible. 
 Non-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate collectability. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments were on non-accrual status.

 Investment Risk Factors First and second lien debt that the Company invests in is almost entirely rated below investment grade or may be unrated. Debt investments rated below investment grade are often referred to as "leveraged loans", "high yield" or "junk" debt investments, and may be considered "high risk" compared to debt investments that are rated investment grade. These debt investments are considered speculative because of the credit risk of the issuers. Such issuers are considered more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal, and such risk of default could reduce the members' capital and income distributions of the Company. In addition, some of the Company's debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which could result in a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. First and second lien debt may also lose significant market value before a default occurs. Furthermore, an active trading market may not exist for these first and second lien debt investments. This illiquidity may make it more difficult to value the debt. 
 Subordinated debt is generally subject to similar risks as those associated with first and second lien debt, except that such debt is subordinated in payment and/or lower in lien priority. Subordinated debt is subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and the property securing the debt, if any, may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to the senior secured and unsecured obligations of the borrower. 
 The Company may directly invest in the equity of private companies or, in some cases, equity investments could be made in connection with a debt investment. Equity investments may or may not fluctuate in value, resulting in recognized realized gains or losses upon disposition.

Transfers into Level III occur as quotations obtained through pricing services are deemed not representative of fair value as of the balance sheet date, and such assets are internally valued. As quotations obtained through pricing services are substantiated through additional market sources, investments are transferred out of Level III. In addition, transfers out of Level III and transfers into Level III occur based on the increase or decrease in the availability of certain observable inputs. Investments will be transferred into Level III from Level II and out of Level III into Level II at fair value as of the beginning of the period in which the reclassification occurred. 
 The Company invests in revolving credit facilities. These investments are categorized as Level III investments as these assets are not actively traded and their fair values are often implied by the term loans of the respective portfolio companies.

 which began on May 3, 2022, and thereafter will continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (A) the vote of the Company's board of directors, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and (B) the vote of a majority of the Company's directors who are not parties to the Investment Management Agreement or "interested persons" (as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) of any such party, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives an annual base management fee and incentive fee from the Company. Although the initial two year term of the Investment Management Agreement would not have expired until May 3, 2024, the Company's board of directors most recently re-approved the Investment Management Agreement on January 30, 2024, at an in-person meeting, for a period of months commencing on March 1, 2024. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the aggregate contributed capital from all unitholders (including any outstanding borrowings under any subscription line drawn in lieu of capital calls) less any return of capital distributions and less any cumulative realized losses since inception (calculated net of any subsequently reversed realized losses and net of any realized gains) as of the last day of the applicable quarter. For the period from the effective date of the Investment Management Agreement through the one year anniversary of the Initial Drawdown Date (as defined in the Investment Management Agreement), the base management fee was reduced by (for the avoidance of doubt, this resulted in an annual management fee rate of through May 9, 2023, the one-year anniversary of the Initial Drawdown Date). Because the one-year anniversary of the Initial Drawdown Date occurred on a date other than the last day of a calendar quarter, the management fee was prorated for such calendar quarter and calculated based on the number of days in such period up to, and including, the one-year anniversary of the Initial Drawdown Date. The base management fee could also be reduced by any voluntary fee waivers made by the Investment Adviser. The management fee will be reduced, but not below , by any amounts paid by the Company or its subsidiaries to a placement agent, any organizational and offering expenses in excess of the lesser of or of the aggregate Capital Commitments pursuant to the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement (as defined below) and any fund expenses in excess of the Specified Expenses Cap (as defined below). 
 The Investment Adviser has entered into agreements with placement agents that provide for ongoing payments from the Investment Adviser based upon the amount of a unitholder's Capital Commitment or capital contributions. Neither the Company nor any unitholders will bear any of the fees paid to placement agents of the Company as any such fees paid by the Company will offset the management fees.

 components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Company's income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Company's capital gains, each as described below. 
 Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 The portion based on the Company's income (the "Income Incentive Fee") is based on pre-incentive fee net investment income ("Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income"). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any fee income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, upfront, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company's operating expenses for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred units, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company's members' capital at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a "hurdle rate" of return of per quarter annualized). 
 The Company will pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 no incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in any calendar quarter in which the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of annualized); 
 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to a rate of return of annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the "catch-up." The "catch-up" is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the dollar amount of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Adviser. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were incentive fees waived. The fees that are payable under the Investment Management Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 Incentive Fee on Capital Gains 
 The second component of the incentive fee is the capital gains incentive fee. The Company will pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to the Company's cumulative realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation since inception ("Cumulative Net Realized Gains") based on the waterfall below: 
 a. First, no incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser on Cumulative Net Realized Gains until total return of capital distributions, distributions of net investment income and distributions of net realized capital gains to unitholders is equal to total capital contributions; 
 b. Second, no incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser on Cumulative Net Realized Gains until the Company has paid cumulative distributions equal to an annualized, cumulative internal rate of return of on the total contributed capital to the Company calculated from the date that each such amount was due to be contributed to the Company until the date each such distribution is paid; 
 c. Third, upon a distribution that results in cumulative distributions exceeding the amounts in clause (a) and (b) above, an incentive fee on capital gains payable to the Investment Adviser equal to of the amount of Cumulative Net Realized Gains until the Investment Adviser has received (together with amounts the Investment Adviser has received under Income Incentive Fees) an amount equal to of the sum of (i) the cumulative distributions to unitholders made pursuant to clause (b) above, (ii) Income Incentive Fee paid to the Investment Adviser and (iii) amounts paid to the Investment Adviser pursuant to this clause (c); and 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 of additional undistributed Cumulative Net Realized Gains. 
 Upon termination of the Company, the Investment Adviser will be required to return incentive fees to the Company to the extent that: (i) the Investment Adviser has received cumulative incentive fees in excess of of the sum of (A) the Company's cumulative distributions other than return of capital contributions and (B) the cumulative incentive fees paid to the Investment Adviser; or (ii) the unitholders have not received a cumulative internal rate of return; provided that in no event will such restoration be more than the incentive fees received by the Investment Adviser. 
 In accordance with GAAP, the Company accrues a hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net realized capital gains and realized capital losses and the cumulative net unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than the amount in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued hypothetical capital gains incentive fees of ) and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did accrue any hypothetical capital gains incentive fees. 
 Expense Limitation 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Investment Adviser has agreed to reduce and/or waive its management fee (the "Specified Expenses Cap") each year such that the Company will not be required to pay Specified Expenses (as defined below) in excess of a maximum aggregate amount in any calendar year (prorated for partial years and portions of years for which each applicable prong of the cap applies) equal to: (1) during the Closing Period, of the greater of (A) or (B) actual aggregate Capital Commitments as of the end of such calendar year, (2) at the end of the Closing Period until the end of the Investment Period, of aggregate committed capital and (3) after the end of the Investment Period, of the Company's average Members' Capital for the calendar year. Further, if the actual aggregate committed capital of the Company at the end of the Closing Period is less than , the prong of the Specified Expenses Cap in clause (1) above will be retroactively adjusted to equal of aggregate committed capital at the end of the Closing Period, and the Investment Adviser has agreed to further reduce and/or waive its management fee for the year in which the Closing Period ends in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the amount that would have been required to be waived/reimbursed pursuant to clause (1) above as adjusted and (B) the amount previously waived/reimbursed pursuant to clause (1) above. "Specified Expenses" of the Company means all Company Expenses (as defined under "Fund Expenses" in the Third A R LLC Agreement) incurred in the operation of the Company with the exception of: (i) the management fee, (ii) any incentive fees, (iii) Organizational and Offering Expenses (as defined in the Third A R LLC Agreement) (which are subject to the Organizational and Offering Expense Cap), (iv) Placement Fees (as defined in the Third A R LLC Agreement), (v) interest on and fees and expenses arising out of all Company indebtedness and other financing, (vi) costs of any litigation and damages (including the costs of any indemnity or contribution right granted to any placement agent or third-party finder engaged by the Company or its affiliates) and (vii) for the avoidance of doubt, if applicable, any investor level withholding or other taxes. 
 If, while the Investment Adviser is the investment adviser to the Company, the annualized Specified Expenses for a given calendar year are less than the Specified Expenses Cap, the Investment Adviser shall be entitled to reimbursement by the Company of the compensation waived and other expenses borne by the Investment Adviser (the "Reimbursement Amount") on behalf of the Company pursuant to the expense limitation and reimbursement agreement between the Company and the Investment Adviser (the "Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement") during any of the previous , and provided that such amount paid to the Investment Adviser will in no event exceed the total Reimbursement Amount and will not include any amounts previously reimbursed. The Reimbursement Amount plus the annualized Specified Expenses for a given calendar year shall not exceed the Specified Expenses Cap. The Investment Adviser may recapture a Specified Expense in any year within the period after the Investment Adviser bears the expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no reimbursements to the Investment Adviser pursuant to this provision. 
 The Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties, provided that any amendment that could result in an increase in expenses borne by the Company also must be approved by vote of a majority of the Company's outstanding Units.

 The Company has entered into an administration agreement with the Administrator (the "Administration Agreement"), under which the Administrator provides administrative services. The Administration Agreement was most recently re-approved by the Company's board of directors on January 30, 2024 for a period of months commencing on March 1, 2024. The Administrator maintains, or oversees the maintenance of, the Company's consolidated financial records, prepares reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), generally monitors the payment of the Company's expenses and oversees the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. The Company reimburses the Administrator for the Company's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations to the Company under the Administration Agreement, including compensation of the Company's chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, and their respective staffs. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by the Company, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to the Company for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on behalf of the Company during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which the Company will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to the Company for reimbursement in the future. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately and , respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, none of which were waived by the Administrator. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately and , respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which and , respectively, were waived by the Administrator. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately and , respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in payable to affiliates. 
 The Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have also entered into a Trademark License Agreement, (as amended, the "Trademark License Agreement"), with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the "New Mountain Capital" name. Under the Trademark License Agreement, subject to certain conditions, the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator will have a right to use the "New Mountain Capital" name, for so long as the Investment Adviser or one of its affiliates remains the investment adviser of the Company. Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator will have no legal right to the "New Mountain Capital" name. 
 The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to the Company's investment mandate. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for the Company or for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that the Company should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the "Exemptive Order") to the Investment Adviser and certain of its affiliates, which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits the Company to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, the Company is permitted to co-invest with its affiliates if a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company's directors who are not "interested persons,"

The BMO Subscription Line is collateralized by the unfunded Capital Commitments of each of the Company's unitholders. All fees associated with the origination and amendment of the BMO Subscription Line are capitalized on the Consolidated Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital and amortized and charged against income as other financing costs over the life of the BMO Subscription Line. The BMO Subscription Line bears interest at the greater of the prime commercial rate minus per annum or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") Quoted Rate (as defined below) for such day plus per annum. SOFR Quoted Rate means as of any day of determination, 3-month Term SOFR on the date that is two U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to such day of determination as such rate is published by the Term SOFR Administrator plus a credit spread adjustment of .

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Unitholders and the Board of Directors of New Mountain Guardian IV BDC, L.L.C. 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members capital of New Mountain Guardian IV BDC, L.L.C. and subsidiaries (the "Company"), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in members capital for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members capital of the Company, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members capital and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 5, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets, liabilities, and members capital as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members capital from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Overview 
 We are a Delaware limited liability company formed on March 18, 2022. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 
 The Investment Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. New Mountain Capital is a global investment firm with approximately 55 billion of assets under management and a track record of investing in the middle market. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, credit and net lease investment strategies. The Investment Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and management services. The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to ours. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the "Administrator"), a wholly-owned 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administrator has hired a third party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 We conducted a private offering (the "Private Offering") of units of our limited liability company interests (the "Units") to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Units will be offered for subscription continuously throughout the Closing Period (as defined below). Each investor in the Private Offering made a capital commitment (each, a "Capital Commitment") to purchase Units pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us (each, a "Subscription Agreement"). We expect closings of the Private Offering will occur, from time to time, in the Investment Adviser's sole discretion, during the 24-month period following the initial closing of Capital Commitments, which occurred on May 4, 2022 (the "Closing Period"). On April 15, 2024, pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended and restated on December 6, 2023 (the "Third A R LLC Agreement"), the Investment Adviser elected to extend the Closing Period from 24 months to 30 months after the initial closing of the Private Offering. As a result of the foregoing, we extended the end of the period during which we may hold subsequent closings from May 4, 2024 to November 4, 2024. We may accept and draw down on Capital Commitments from investors throughout the Closing Period and may draw down on Capital Commitments after the Closing Period. We commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial drawdown from investors in the Private Offering, which occurred on May 9, 2022 (the "Initial Drawdown"). The investment period began on May 4, 2022 and will continue until November 4, 2028, the four-year anniversary of the end of the Closing Period (the "Investment Period"). Our term is until November 4, 2030, six years from the end of the Closing Period, subject to (i) a one year extension as determined by the Investment Adviser in its sole discretion and (ii) an additional one year extension as determined by our board of directors. 
 We established New Mountain Guardian IV SPV, L.L.C. ("GIV SPV") on July 26, 2022 as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, whose assets are used to secure GIV SPV's credit facility. We established New Mountain Guardian IV Holdings, L.L.C. ("GIV Holdings"), formerly known as New Mountain Guardian IV Issuer SPV, L.L.C., on October 28, 2022 as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, whose assets are used to secure GIV Holdings' credit facility. We established New Mountain Guardian IV Panzura, Inc. ("GIV Panzura") and New Mountain Guardian IV PPP, Inc. ("GIV PPP") as wholly-owned direct subsidiaries, which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are intended to facilitate our compliance with the requirements to be treated as a RIC under the Code by holding equity or equity-like investments in certain of our portfolio companies that are organized as a limited liability company or other form of pass-through entity; we consolidate these corporations for accounting purposes but the corporations are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may incur U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of our ownership of the portfolio companies. 
 We focus on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. upper middle market companies backed by top private equity sponsors. Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of senior secured loans and select junior capital positions to growing businesses in defensive industries that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our differentiated investment approach leverages the deep sector knowledge and operating resources of New Mountain Capital. 
 We primarily invest in senior secured debt of U.S. sponsor-backed, middle market companies. We define middle-market companies as those with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of 10.0 million to 200.0 million. Our focus is on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams. 
 Senior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. We invest a significant portion of our portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt. Certain unitranche loan investments may include "last-out" positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. In some cases, our investments may also include equity interests. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our top five industry concentrations were software, business services, healthcare, financial services and consumer services. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our members' capital was approximately 673.4 million and our portfolio had a fair value of approximately 1,244.5 million in 108 portfolio companies. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 7, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Wells Loan and Security Agreement (the Wells Amendment by and among GIV Holdings, as borrower, us, as seller, as equityholder and as collateral manager, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent and swingline lender, and Western Alliance Trust Company, N.A., as the collateral custodian.

 Agreement was increased to a maximum of 500.0 million from 250.0 million. All other terms of the Wells Loan and Security Agreement remain in full force and effect. 
 On November 4, 2024, our Closing Period ended with total Capital Commitments of 1,207.9 million. 
 On November 7, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the UBS Loan and Security Agreement (the Second Amendment by and among GIV SPV, as the borrower, us, as collateral manager, equityholder, and seller, the lenders from time to time party thereto, UBS AG London Branch, as the administrative agent, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as the collateral agent, and U.S. Bank National Association as the document custodian. The Second Amendment amended the UBS Credit Facility to, among other things: (i) extend the Facility Maturity Date (as defined in the Second Amendment to the UBS Loan and Security Agreement) from January 2028 to January 2029; and (ii) increase the maximum facility amount from 250.0 million to 350.0 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting estimates. 
 Basis of Accounting 
 We consolidate our wholly-owned direct subsidiaries GIV SPV, GIV Holdings, GIV Panzura and GIV PPP. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies ("ASC 946"). 
 Valuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments 
 At all times, consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, which impacts our members' capital. 
 We value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: 
 (1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. 
 (2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. 
 a. Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and, if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and 
 b. For investments other than bonds, we look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following procedures: 
 i. Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. We will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, we will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; and 
 ii. Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 (3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: 
 a. Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring; 
 b. Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management; 
 c. If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and 
 d. When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided. 
 For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of a commitment not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded. 
 The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material. 
 GAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows: 
 Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. 
 Level II Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following: 
 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently); 
 Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and 
 Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 Level III Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. 
 The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs. 
 The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Valu e in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 We generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there is little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered: 
 Company Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and EBITDA growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original investment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation. 
 For debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value. After enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment. 
 Market Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing EBITDA or revenue multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, and relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA or revenue multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month ("LTM") EBITDA or revenue or projected EBITDA or revenue to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA or revenue multiples will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. 
 Income Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a combination of a yield calibration approach and a comparable investment approach. The yield calibration approach incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. The comparable investment approach utilizes and average yield-to-maturity of a selected set of high-quality, liquid investments to determine a comparable investment discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Value in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our Level III investments as of September 30, 2024. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Sales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method. 
 Interest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal balance on the capitalization date and are generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized PIK dividends from investments of 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, and PIK interest from investments of 1.2 million and 3.6 million, respectively. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized PIK 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 dividends from investments of less than 80 thousand and PIK interest from investments of 0.7 million and 1.0 million, respectively. 
 Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible. 
 Non-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate collectability. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no investments were on non-accrual status. 
 Fee income: Fee income represents delayed compensation, revolver fees, amendment fees, upfront fees, consent fees and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after the trade date. Fee income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received by us for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment, and are non-refundable. 
 
 Monitoring of Portfolio Investments 
 We monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy. Our portfolio monitoring procedures are designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive analysis of our portfolio companies based on their operating performance and underlying business characteristics, which in turn forms the basis of its Risk Rating (as defined below). 
 We use an investment risk rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. As such, we assign each investment a composite score ("Risk Rating") based on two metrics 1) Operating Performance and 2) Business Characteristics: 
 Operating Performance assesses the health of the investment in context of its financial performance and the market environment it faces. The metric is expressed in Tiers of "4" to "1", with "4" being the best and "1" being the worst: 
 Tier 4 Business performance is in-line with or above expectations 
 Tier 3 Moderate business underperformance and/or moderate market headwinds 
 Tier 2 Significant business underperformance and/or significant market headwinds 
 Tier 1 Severe business underperformance and/or severe market headwinds 
 Business Characteristics assesses the health of the investment in context of the underlying portfolio company's business and credit quality, the underlying portfolio company's current balance sheet, and the level of support from the equity sponsor. The metric is expressed as on a qualitative scale of "A" to "C", with "A" being the best and "C" being the worst. 
 The Risk Rating for each investment is a composite of these two metrics. The Risk Rating is expressed in categories of Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red, with Green reflecting an investment that is in-line with or above expectations and Red reflecting an investment performing materially below expectations. The mapping of the composite scores to these categories are below: 
 Green 4C, 3B, 2A, 4B, 3A, and 4A (e.g., Tier 4 for Operating Performance and C for Business Characteristics) 
 Yellow 3C, 2B, and 1A 
 Orange 2C and 1B 
 Red 1C

 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Three Months Ended (in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Total interest income 30,644 8,850 Dividend income 84 26 Fee income 2,340 1,162 Total investment income 33,068 10,038 
 Our total investment income increased by approximately 23.0 million, or 229 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of approximately 33.1 million consisted of approximately 28.1 million in cash interest from investments, approximately 1.2 million in PIK and non-cash interest from investments, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately 1.3 million, approximately 0.1 million in PIK dividends from investments and approximately 2.3 million in fee income. 
 The increase in interest income of approximately 21.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to our deployment of capital and increasing invested balances over the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fee income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to upfront, amendment, ticking, consent and closing fees received from 22 different portfolio companies. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Three Months Ended (in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Management fee 2,529 675 Less: management fee waiver (617) (14) Net management fee 1,912 661 Interest and other financing expenses 12,231 3,797 Income based incentive fee 2,701 674 Administrative expenses 533 299 Professional fees 313 200 Organizational and offering expenses 8 569 Capital gains incentive fee (102) Other general and administrative expenses 62 116 Total expenses 17,658 6,316 Less: expenses waived (95) Net expenses 17,658 6,221 
 Our total net operating expenses increased by approximately 11.4 million or 184 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net management fee increased by 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to larger managed and invested capital balances, partially offset by a voluntary fee waiver made by the Investment Adviser over the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our income based incentive fee increased by approximately 2.0 million and our capital gains incentive fee decreased by approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income based incentive fees was attributable to larger managed and invested capital balances over the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in capital gains incentive fees was due to the reduction of the accrual for hypothetical gains recognized if the portfolio was sold at fair value in accordance with GAAP which was driven by the net depreciation on the portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The hypothetical accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than the amount in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. Amounts accrued are not payable unless gains are realized. 
 Interest and other financing expenses increased by approximately 8.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher drawn balances on our UBS Credit Facility and BMO Subscription Line and the establishment of the Wells Credit Facility. 
 Our total administrative expenses, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the continued ramp up of investment operations and deployment of capital. 
 Net Realized Gains (Losses) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Three Months Ended (in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net realized gains (losses) on investments (195) 1 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments (622) 4,469 (Provision) benefit for taxes (1) Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) (818) 4,470 
 Our net realized loss and unrealized depreciation resulted in a net loss of approximately 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net realized and unrealized appreciation resulting in a net gain of approximately 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations, we look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the sale of 1 investment at loss and material accelerated amortization recognized on 7 of our investments due to early repayments made. The net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the overall increase in market prices of our investments during the period. 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Total interest income 74,365 19,652 Dividend income 159 75 Fee income 6,038 2,216 Total investment income 80,562 21,943 
 Our total investment income increased by approximately 58.6 million, or 267 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of approximately 80.6 million consisted of approximately 67.2 million in cash interest from investments, approximately 3.6 million in PIK and non-cash interest from investments, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately 3.6 million, approximately 0.2 million in PIK dividends from investments and approximately 6.0 million in fee income. 
 The increase in interest income of approximately 54.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to our deployment of capital and increasing invested balances over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Fee income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to upfront, amendment, closing, ticking and consent fees received from 60 different portfolio companies.

 Our total net operating expenses increased by approximately 28.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net management fee increased by approximately 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Per the Investment Management Agreement (as defined below), the management fee was reduced by 50 until the one-year anniversary of the Initial Drawdown Date, which occurred on May 9, 2023 (as defined in the Investment Management Agreement). The base management fee may also be reduced by placement fees and a voluntary fee waiver made by the Investment Adviser. Our income based incentive fee increased by approximately 5.3 million and our capital gains incentive fee increased by approximately 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in management fees and income based incentive fees was attributable to larger managed and invested capital balances over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as the expiration of the 50 management fee waiver on May 9, 2023. The increase in capital gains incentive fees was due to the accrual for hypothetical gains recognized if the portfolio was sold at fair value in accordance with GAAP. The hypothetical accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than the amount in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. Amounts accrued are not payable unless gains are realized. 
 Interest and other financing expenses increased by approximately 19.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher drawn balances on our UBS Credit Facility and BMO Subscription Line and the establishment of the Wells Credit Facility. 
 Our total administrative expenses, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the continued ramp up of investment operations and deployment of capital.

 depreciation can be the result of realizations, we look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together. The net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also primarily driven by the overall increase in market prices of our investments during the period, partially offset by realized losses on two positions. The net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the overall increase in market prices of our investments during the period. 
 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Borrowings and Contractual Obligations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our unitholders or for other general corporate purposes. 
 We expect to generate cash from (1) drawing down capital in respect of our Units, (2) cash flows from investments and operations and (3) borrowings from banks or other lenders. We will seek to enter into any bank debt, credit facility or other financing arrangements on at least customary market terms, however, we cannot assure you we will be able to do so. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. Upon organization, we adopted the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which resulted in the reduction of the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to us from 200.0 to 150.0 . In connection with their subscriptions for our Units, our unitholders were required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150.0 . In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150.0 after such borrowing (which means we can borrow 2 for every 1 of our equity). As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 197.7 . 
 Since our inception on March 18, 2022, we have entered into Subscription Agreements with several investors on various dates. We expect closings of the Private Offering will occur, from time to time, in the Investment Adviser's sole discretion, during the Closing Period. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had aggregate capital commitments accepted and undrawn capital commitments from investors as follows: 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Capital Commitments 1,207.9 768.5 Unfunded Capital Commitments 543.6 499.5 of Capital Commitments funded 55.0 35.0 
 As of September 30, 2024, our borrowings consisted of the BMO Subscription Line, UBS Credit Facility and Wells Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, our borrowings consisted of the BMO Subscription Line and UBS Credit Facility. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 6. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 10.5 million and 7.2 million, respectively. Our cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was approximately 561.9 million and 194.1 million, respectively. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from drawdowns on Capital Commitments, investments and operations and borrowings from banks or other lenders. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to third parties to fund investments totaling 277.9 million and 144.1 million, respectively, under various undrawn revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments. 
 We may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitment letters to purchase investments in the aggregate par amount of 101.1 million and 10.4 million, respectively, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments which could require funding in the future.

 Contractual Obligations 
 A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2024 is as follows: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years BMO Subscription Line (1) 215.5 215.5 UBS Credit Facility (2) 226.4 226.4 Wells Credit Facility (3) 247.7 247.7 Total Contractual Obligations 689.6 215.5 474.1 
 (1) Under the terms of the BMO Subscription Line, all outstanding borrowings under that facility 215.5 million as of September 30, 2024) are due on BMO's demand within 15 business days or on the date 6 months after each advance date, which varies throughout the period. The BMO Subscription Line will terminate when all Capital Commitments have been funded. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 6. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for material details on the BMO Subscription Line. 
 (2) Under the terms of the 250.0 million UBS Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility 226.4 million as of September 30, 2024) must be repaid on or before January 25, 2028. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 23.6 million of possible capacity remaining under the UBS Credit Facility. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 6. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for material details on the UBS Credit Facility. 
 (3) Under the terms of the 250.0 million Wells Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility 247.7 million as of September 30, 2024) must be repaid on or before May 21, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 2.3 million million of possible capacity remaining under the Wells Credit Facility. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 6. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for material details on the Wells Credit Facility. 
 We have entered into an investment advisory and management agreement (the "Investment Management Agreement") with the Investment Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser has agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a management fee and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. 
 We have also entered into an administration agreement (the "Administration Agreement") with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to arrange office space for us and provide office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and other administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations. The Administrator has also agreed to maintain, or oversee the maintenance of, our financial records, our reports to unitholders and reports filed with the SEC. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 If any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that are entered into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement. 
 
 Distributions and Dividends 
 Distributions declared to unitholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 38.0 million. 
 Tax characteristics of all distributions paid are reported to unitholders on Form 1099 or Form 1042 after the end of the calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total distributions declared were 18.0 million and 2.6 million, respectively, of which the distributions were comprised of approximately 84.96 and 100.00 , respectively, of ordinary income, 0.00 and 0.00 , respectively, of long-term capital gains and 15.04 and 0.00 , respectively, of a return of capital. Future quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our board of directors. 
 We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders in amounts sufficient to qualify as and maintain our status as a RIC. We intend to distribute approximately all of our net investment income on a quarterly basis and substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment.

 Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement. 
 We have entered into the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement with the Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser has agreed to reduce and/or waive its management fee (the "Specified Expenses Cap") each year such that we will not be required to pay certain expenses in excess of a maximum aggregate amount defined in the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement. 
 We have entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges our office space and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to us under the Administration Agreement, which includes the fees and expenses associated with performing administrative, finance, and compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by us, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to us for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on our behalf during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which we will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to us for reimbursement in the future. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 0.2 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, none of which were waived by the Administrator. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 0.2 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in payable to affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. 
 We, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a royalty-free Trademark License Agreement with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant us, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "New Mountain Capital". 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. 
 The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to our investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the "Exemptive Order") to the Investment Adviser and certain of its affiliates, which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits us to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57 (o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our unitholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. The Exemptive Order was amended on August 30, 2022 to permit us to complete follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Federal Reserve was periodically raising interest rates to combat inflation and maintained the same rate benchmark from July 2023 to September 2024. While the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 for the first time since March 2020, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. In a high interest rate environment, our net investment income would increase due to an increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. However, our cost of funds would also increase, which could also impact net investment income. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result in a recession in the United States, which would likely decrease interest rates. Alternatively, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of base rates, such as SOFR to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain of the loans held in our portfolio had floating Prime or SOFR interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 96.24 of our investments at fair value (excluding unfunded debt investments and non-interest bearing equity investments) represent floating-rate investments with a SOFR floor (includes investments bearing prime interest rate contracts) and approximately 3.76 of investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. Additionally, our senior secured revolving credit facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR and Prime interest rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense, should interest rates decrease by 200, 150, 100 or 50 basis points, or increase by 50, 100, 150, 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our UBS Credit Facility, Wells Credit Facility and BMO Subscription Line. For our borrowings, we use the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. This analysis does not take into account the impact of the incentive fee or other expenses. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. 
 Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table. 
 Change in Interest Rates Estimated Percentage Change in Interest Income Net of Interest Expense (unaudited) 200 Basis Points (12.72) 150 Basis Points (9.54) 100 Basis Points (6.36) 50 Basis Points (3.18) +50 Basis Points 3.18 +100 Basis Points 6.36 +150 Basis Points 9.54 +200 Basis Points 12.72

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

If Loans are secured directly or indirectly by securities traded on a national exchange or by other margin stock (as defined by the Federal Reserve Board in Regulation U), then the Fund promises to furnish the Lender a duly executed and completed Form U-1 statement and agrees that the proceeds of Loans from the Loan Account will not be used to purchase or carry margin stock, convertible bonds convertible into margin stock or warrants for margin stock unless the Fund has obtained the prior written consent of the Lender. Loans will be made available from the Loan Account subject to the Lender s approval on a case-by-case basis as and when Loans are requested by the Fund. All Loans shall be made against and evidenced by the Fund s promissory note payable to the Lender and its registered assigns, such note to be in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (the Note ). The Lender agrees that the Note shall evidence only the actual unpaid principal balance of Loans made under the Loan Account. All Loans made against the Note and the status of all amounts evidenced by the Note shall be recorded by the Lender on its books and records or, at its option in any instance, on a schedule to the Note and the unpaid principal balance and status and rates so recorded by the Lender shall be prima facie evidence in any court or other proceeding brought to enforce the Note of the principal amount remaining unpaid thereon, the status of the Loans evidenced thereby and the interest rates applicable thereto, absent manifest error; provided, that the failure of the Lender to record any of the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Fund to repay the principal amount of the Note together with accrued interest thereon. Subject to Section 17, the Lender agrees that if it transfers or assigns the Note, the Lender will stamp thereon a statement of the -4- actual principal amount evidenced thereby at the time of transfer. The Fund agrees that in any action or proceeding instituted to collect or enforce collection of the Note, the amount shown as owing the Lender on its records shall be prima facie evidence of the unpaid balance of principal and interest on the Note, absent manifest error. 2. Interest. The Fund shall pay the Lender interest on the unpaid principal balance of Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Accrued interest will be billed monthly, and is payable in arrears on the first Business Day of each month (each, an Interest Payment Date for interest accrued through the last day of the previous month. Interest for each billing period is computed by applying a daily periodic rate based on the greater of (i) the Prime Rate minus the Prime Rate Margin or (ii) the SOFR Quoted Rate plus the SOFR Margin to each day s ending Loan balance. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365/366 days for the actual number of days elapsed. The Prime Rate reflects market rates of interest as well as other factors, and it is not necessarily the Lender s best or lowest rate. The daily Loan balance shall be computed by taking the principal balance of Loans at the beginning of each day, adding any Loans posted to the Loan Account that day, and subtracting any principal payments posted to the Loan Account as of that day. Interest begins to accrue on the date a Loan is posted to the Loan Account. The principal balance of Loans which remains unpaid on the due date therefor (after giving effect to any applicable grace period, including the fifteen (15) Business Day period applicable in the case of a demand for repayment) shall bear interest thereafter until paid in full at a post-maturity rate determined by adding the rate of 2.00 per annum to the interest rate otherwise applicable to the Loans (determined as aforesaid). The interest rate payable under this Agreement shall be subject, however, to the limitation that such interest rate shall never exceed the highest rate which the Fund may contract to pay under applicable law. Interest on the Loans shall, at the option of the Fund and subject to the following terms and conditions, be payable either (i) in immediately available funds on each Interest Payment Date in accordance with this Section 2, or (ii) through a Loan on each Interest Payment Date, or (iii) by any combination of the methods described in the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii) selected by the Fund which results in such methods being applied in the satisfaction in full of all interest due on the Loans on such Interest Payment Date: (a) Unless the Fund notifies the Lender by 12:00 noon (New York Time) on the applicable Interest Payment Date that the Fund intends to pay the interest due on the Loans on such Interest Payment Date with funds not borrowed under this Agreement, the Fund shall be deemed to have irrevocably requested a Loan on each Interest Payment Date in the amount of the interest then due on the Loans, in each case subject to the provisions of this Agreement (other than the Minimum Amount requirement), which new Loan shall be applied to pay the interest then due on the Loans. In the event the Fund has elected to pay the interest due on the Loans with funds not borrowed under this Agreement and the Fund fails to make any such payment within twenty (20) days of the applicable Interest Payment Date, the Lender may in its sole discretion deem the Fund to have irrevocably requested a Loan in the amount of the interest then due on the Loans, in each case subject to the provisions of this Agreement (other than the requirement that a Loan be in a Minimum Amount) which new Loans shall be applied to pay the interest then due on the Loans. (b) Each payment of interest by a borrowing of a Loan shall be evidenced by the Note, shall bear interest from the date made at a rate per annum equal at all times to the rate then applicable to the Loans, payable on the Maturity Date therefor. (c) In no event shall the unpaid principal balance of all Loans, including, without limitation, each borrowing of a Loan to pay interest then due on the Loans, exceed the Amount of Maximum Credit. -5- 3. Reserved. 4. Payments. Payments received by the Lender shall be applied first to accrued interest and then to the principal balance of outstanding Loans unless otherwise determined by the Lender. If any payment from the Fund under this Agreement becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next Business Day and any such extension shall be included in computing interest under this Agreement. 5. Periodic Statements. The Lender will furnish the Fund with a monthly statement for each billing period which has any transaction or balance (each, a Periodic Statement ). 6. Financial Statements. The Fund agrees to furnish financial information of the Fund to the Lender upon reasonable request of the Lender from time to time and to the extent reasonably available to the Fund. Such information shall be furnished as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within thirty (30) days after request by the Lender. Without any such request, the Fund shall deliver to the Lender: (a) as soon as available, and in any event within thirty (30) days after the last day of each fiscal quarter, a certificate as of such date in the form, or substantially the form, of Exhibit B attached hereto; (b) promptly after the same are made available to the Fund s Members, and in any event within sixty (60) days after the last day of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of the Fund, a copy of the Fund s balance sheet as of the last day of such fiscal quarter and its statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year-to-date period then ended, prepared by the Fund in accordance in all material respects with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), except as otherwise stated therein (and subject to the absence of footnotes and ordinary year-end adjustments), and certified to by its chief financial officer or such other officer reasonably acceptable to the Lender; and (c) promptly after the same are made available to the Fund s Members, and in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each fiscal year of the Fund, a copy of the Fund s balance sheet as of the last day of the fiscal year then ended and its statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, and accompanying notes thereto, accompanied by an unqualified opinion (as to scope of audit or going concern) thereon of a firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing, selected by the Fund and reasonably satisfactory to the Lender to the effect that the financial statements present fairly in all material respects in accordance with GAAP the financial condition of the Fund as of the close of such fiscal year and the results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no financial statements or other financial deliveries shall be required to be furnished to the Lender pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) of this Section until such time as such financial statements or deliveries are first made available to the Fund s Members. 7. Covenants.

(d) that the Loans to the Fund shall not at any time cause the Fund to exceed the aggregate amount of Fund Indebtedness that it is permitted to have outstanding under its LLC Agreement or other organizational documents of the Fund; (e) that at no time shall the Fund incur any third party indebtedness or other outstanding obligations, other than (i) with the prior written consent of the Lender, (ii) contingent obligations that are (A) related to an SPV Facility and not constituting a payment guaranty or repurchase obligation arising in

(d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, in accordance with immediately preceding clause (c), from the Lender that is a Payment Recipient (such unrecovered amount as to such Lender, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ), then at the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and upon the Administrative Agent s or the Collateral Agent s, as applicable, written notice to such Payment Recipient (i) such Payment Recipient shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, or, at the option of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the Lender Affiliated with the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, in a principal amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Advances (but not Commitments), the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest, without further consent or approval of any party hereto without any further payment by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, or their respective Affiliated Lender, as applicable, as the assignee of such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.
