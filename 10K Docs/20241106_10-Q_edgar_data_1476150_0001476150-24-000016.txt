 Overview 
 Terreno Realty Corporation Terreno , and together with its subsidiaries, we , us , our , our Company , or the Company acquires, owns and operates industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets: Northern New Jersey/New York City; Los Angeles; Miami; San Francisco Bay Area; Seattle and Washington, D.C. We invest in several types of industrial real estate, including warehouse/distribution (approximately 77.9 of our total annualized base rent as of September 30, 2024), flex (including light industrial and research and development, or R D) (approximately 3.7 ), transshipment (approximately 6.4 and improved land (approximately 12.0 ). We target functional properties in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate. Infill locations are geographic locations surrounded by high concentrations of already developed land and existing buildings. As of September 30, 2024, we owned a total of 294 buildings (including two properties consisting of three buildings held for sale) aggregating approximately 18.3 million square feet, 45 improved land parcels consisting of approximately 152.4 acres, eight properties under development or redevelopment and approximately 35.4 acres of land for future development. As of September 30, 2024, our buildings and improved land parcels were approximately 97.0 and 98.1 leased, respectively, to 675 customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3.3 of our total annualized base rent. See Item 1 Our Investment Strategy Industrial Facility General Characteristics in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a general description of these types of industrial real estate. 
 We are an internally managed Maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.

 Our industrial properties are typically subject to leases on a triple net basis, in which tenants pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a modified gross basis, in which tenants pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, approximately 97.6 of our leased space includes fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis by reviewing outstanding accounts receivable balances, and as provided under the respective lease agreements, review the tenant s financial condition periodically as appropriate. As needed, we hold discussions with the tenant s management about their business and we conduct site visits of the tenant s operations.

 Our ability to re-lease or renew expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, leases representing approximately 2.3 of the total annualized base rent of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2024. We currently expect that, on average, the rental rates we are likely to achieve on new (re-leased) or renewed leases for our remaining 2024 expirations will be above the rates currently being paid for the same space. Cash rent changes on new and renewed leases totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet and 0.3 acres of improved land commencing during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 24.1 higher as compared to the previous rental rates for that same space, and cash rent changes on new and renewed leases totaling approximately 1.6 million square feet and 22.5 acres commencing during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 40.5 higher as compared to the previous rental rates for that same space. We had a tenant retention ratio for the operating portfolio of 67.3 and 58.0 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had a tenant retention ratio for the improved land portfolio of 100.0 and 66.3 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We define tenant retention ratio as the square footage or acreage of all leases commenced during the period that are rented by existing tenants divided by the square footage or acreage of all expiring leases during the reporting period. The square footage or acreage of tenants that default or buy-out prior to expiration of their lease and short-term leases of less than one year are not included in the calculation.

 Our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. Further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular market may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and re-leased/renewed rental rates for particular properties within a market may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio within a particular market, in each case due to a number of factors, including local real estate conditions, local supply and demand for industrial space, the condition of the property, the impact of leasing incentives, including free rent and tenant improvements, and whether the property, or space within the property, has been redeveloped.

 1 Excludes intangible liabilities. The total aggregate initial investment was approximately 7.9 million, including 0.3 million in capitalized closing costs and acquisition costs. 
 2 Stabilized capitalization rates, referred to herein as stabilized cap rates, are calculated, at the time of acquisition, as annualized cash basis net operating income for the property stabilized to market occupancy (generally 95 divided by the total acquisition cost for the property. Total acquisition cost basis for the property includes the initial purchase price, the effects of marking assumed debt to market, buyer s due diligence and closing costs, estimated near-term capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to achieve stabilization. We define cash basis net operating income for the property as net operating income excluding straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles. These stabilized cap rates are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control, including risks related to our ability to meet our estimated forecasts related to stabilized cap rates and those risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our other public filings.

 4 Countyline Phase IV is a 121-acre project entitled for 2.2 million square feet of industrial distribution buildings located in Miami s Countyline Corporate Park Countyline ), immediately adjacent to our seven buildings within Countyline. Countyline Phase IV, a landfill redevelopment adjacent to Florida s Turnpike and the southern terminus of I-75, is expected to contain ten LEED-certified industrial distribution buildings at completion. 
 5 This redevelopment property was initially acquired in 2017 for a total initial investment, including closing costs and acquisition costs, of approximately 39.9 million. The property was in the operating portfolio until January 2024 when redevelopment commenced. The amount spent to date includes the total initial investment and capital expenditures

 incurred prior to redevelopment and excludes accumulated depreciation recorded since acquisition. We expect a total incremental investment of approximately 64.0 million. 
 6 On October 21, 2024, we commenced development of Countyline Building 34 in Countyline Phase IV. Upon completion, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2025, Countyline Building 34 will consist of one approximately 220,000 square foot industrial building with a total expected investment of approximately 55.9 million and an estimated stabilized cap rate of 5.7 . The building is 70 pre-leased. The lease will commence upon completion of the building and tenant improvements and will expire in February 2033. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed development of three properties. The following table summarizes certain information with respect to the development properties completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Disposition Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold one property located in the Seattle market for a sales price of approximately 11.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately 5.7 million. 
 The following summarizes the condensed results of operations of the property sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 In July 2024, we repaid the 100.0 million tranche of our 7-year senior unsecured notes using existing cash on hand. The notes bore interest at 3.8 and had an original maturity date of July 14, 2024. 
 Public Offering 
 On March 27, 2024, we completed a public offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of 62.00, which included the underwriters full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares. The net proceeds of the 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 offering were approximately 387.1 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering costs of approximately 5.0 million. We used the net proceeds for acquisitions. 
 ATM Program 
 We have an at-the-market equity offering program (the " 500 Million ATM Program") pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 500.0 million 438.3 million remaining as of September 30, 2024) in amounts and at times as we determine from time to time. Prior to the implementation of the 500 Million ATM Program, we had a previous at-the-market equity program (the Previous 500 Million ATM Program ), which was substantially utilized as of August 27, 2024 and which is no longer active. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the shares under the 500 Million ATM Program, if any, for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions, redevelopments and repayment of indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued an aggregate of 2,976,266 and 5,329,544 shares, respectively, of common stock at a weighted average offering price of 68.70 and 66.62 per share, respectively, under the Previous 500 Million ATM Program and the 500 Million ATM Program, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 201.5 million and 349.9 million, respectively, and paying total compensation to the applicable sales agents of approximately 3.0 million and 5.1 million, respectively. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We have a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 3,000,000 shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time through December 31, 2026. Purchases made pursuant to this program, if any, will be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us in our discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, we had not repurchased any shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. 
 Dividend and Distribution Activity 
 On November 5, 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of 0.49 per share of our common stock payable on January 7, 2025 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 13, 2024. 
 Contractual Commitments 
 As of November 5, 2024, we had two outstanding contracts to acquire two industrial properties for a total price of 163.9 million, as described under the heading Material Cash Commitments in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, we have a commitment to assume existing debt of approximately 72.9 million secured by one of the properties. There is no assurance that we will acquire the properties under contract because the proposed acquisitions are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence and various closing conditions. 
 Inflation 
 The U.S. economy experienced a significant increase in inflation rates in recent years. A wide variety of industries and sectors have been, and will continue to be, affected by increasing commodity prices. In recent years, inflation has increased construction costs, including tenant improvements and capital projects, goods and labor, and operating costs. Most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, leases with respect to approximately 63.5 of our total rentable square feet and improved land acreage expire within five years which enables us to seek to replace existing leases with new leases at the then-existing market rate. 
 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 We derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties. These revenues include fixed base rents and recoveries of certain property operating expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants. Approximately 97.6 of our leased space includes fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years.

 Our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses, which include: real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, management expenses, insurance, utilities, general and administrative expenses, which include compensation costs, office expenses, professional fees and other administrative expenses, acquisition costs, which include third-party costs paid to brokers and consultants, and interest expense, primarily on our revolving credit facility, term loans and senior unsecured notes. 
 Our consolidated results of operations often are not comparable from period to period due to the impact of property acquisitions at various times during the course of such periods. The results of operations of any acquired property are included in our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition. 
 The analysis of our results below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes the changes attributable to same store properties. The same store pool for the comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes all properties that were owned and in operation as of September 30, 2024 and since January 1, 2023 and excludes properties that were either disposed of prior to, held for sale to a third party or in development or redevelopment as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the same store pool consisted of 243 buildings aggregating approximately 14.6 million square feet representing approximately 79.8 of our total square feet owned and 44 improved land parcels consisting of approximately 145.3 acres representing approximately 95.3 of our total acreage owned. As of September 30, 2024, the non-same store properties, which we acquired, developed or redeveloped, or sold during 2024 and 2023 or were held for sale or in development or redevelopment as of September 30, 2024, consisted of 51 buildings (including two properties consisting of three buildings held for sale) aggregating approximately 3.7 million square feet, one improved land parcel consisting of approximately 7.1 acres, eight properties under development or redevelopment and approximately 35.4 acres of land for future development. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our consolidated same store pool occupancy was approximately 97.3 and 98.4 , respectively. 
 Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles, may be impacted by the acquisitions of additional properties, and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

 Revenues. Total revenues increased approximately 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year due primarily to increased revenue on new and renewed leases and property acquisitions during 2024 and 2023. Cash rents on new and renewed leases totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet and 0.3 acres of improved land commencing during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 24.1 compared to the previous rental rates for that same space in the same period from the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 2.1 million and 1.8 million, respectively, was recorded in straight-line rental revenues related to contractual rent abatements given to certain tenants and approximately 10,000 and 0.1 million, respectively, was recorded in lease termination revenue. The increase in total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in occupancy for the operating portfolio. Additionally, total revenues for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were partially offset by approximately 0.1 million of bad debt write-offs. 
 Property operating expenses. Total property operating expenses increased approximately 5.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year. The increase in total property operating expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 3.8 million attributable to property acquisitions during 2024 and 2023 as well as increases in insurance premiums and real estate taxes. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased approximately 5.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to property acquisitions during 2024 and 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased approximately 1.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to increased compensation expenses including increased restricted stock amortization, LTIP expense and bonus expense, and an increase in the number of employees and salaries compared to the same period from the prior year. 
 Interest and other income. Interest and other income increased approximately 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances. 
 Interest expense, including amortization. Interest expense decreased approximately 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year. This was primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest for the development and redevelopment properties, and lower outstanding debt due to the repayment of the 100 million tranche of 7-year Senior Unsecured Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Revenues. Total revenues increased approximately 41.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year due primarily to increased revenue on new and renewed leases and property acquisitions during 2024 and 2023. Cash rents on new and renewed leases totaling approximately 1.6 million square feet and 22.5 acres commencing during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 40.5 compared to the same space in the same period from the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 5.4 million and 5.9 million, respectively, was recorded in straight-line rental revenues related to contractual rent abatements given to certain tenants and approximately 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, was recorded in lease termination revenue. The increase in total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in occupancy for the operating portfolio. Additionally, total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were partially offset by approximately 0.2 million and 0.4 million, respectively, of bad debt write-offs. 
 Property operating expenses. Total property operating expenses increased approximately 12.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year. The increase in total property operating expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 7.0 million attributable to property acquisitions during 2024 and 2023 as well as increases in insurance premiums and real estate taxes. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased approximately 13.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to property acquisitions during 2024 and 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased approximately 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to increased compensation expenses including increased restricted stock amortization, LTIP expense and bonus expense, and an increase in the number of employees and salaries compared to the same period from the prior year. 
 Interest and other income. Interest and other income increased approximately 5.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances. 
 Interest expense, including amortization. Interest expense decreased approximately 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year. This was primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest for the development and redevelopment properties, and lower outstanding debt due to the repayment of the 100 million tranche of 7-year Senior Unsecured Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain on sales of real estate investments. Gain on sales of real estate investments decreased approximately 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year. We recognized a gain of approximately 5.7 million from the sale of one property during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a gain of approximately 12.3 million from the sale of one property during the same period from the prior year. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility with a conservative capital structure using retained cash flows, proceeds from dispositions of properties, long-term debt and the issuance of common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth. Over the long-term, we intend to: 
 limit the sum of the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness and the liquidation preference of any outstanding perpetual preferred stock to less than 35 of our total enterprise value; 
 maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 2.0x; 
 maintain a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio below 5.0x; 
 limit the principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt to less than 20 of our total consolidated indebtedness; and 
 have staggered debt maturities that are aligned to our expected average lease term (five to seven years), positioning us to re-price parts of our capital structure as our rental rates change with market conditions. 
 We intend to preserve a flexible capital structure with a long-term goal to maintain our investment grade rating and be in a position to issue additional unsecured debt and perpetual preferred stock. We intend to primarily utilize senior unsecured notes, term loans, credit facilities, dispositions of properties, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and perpetual preferred stock. We may also assume debt in connection with property acquisitions which may have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund operating requirements, pay interest on any borrowings and fund distributions in accordance with the REIT requirements of the federal income tax laws. In the near-term, we intend to fund future investments in properties, property developments and redevelopments and scheduled debt maturities with cash on hand, term loans, senior unsecured notes, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, perpetual preferred and common stock issuances and, from time to time, property dispositions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including with respect to other investments in industrial properties, property acquisitions, property developments and redevelopments, renovations and expansions and scheduled debt maturities, through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, periodic issuances of common stock, perpetual preferred stock, and long-term unsecured and secured debt, and, from time to time, with proceeds from the disposition of properties. The success of our acquisition strategy may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and borrow under our revolving credit facility and to access additional capital through issuances of equity and debt securities. 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 Equity Sources of Liquidity 
 On March 27, 2024, we completed a public offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of 62.00, which included the underwriters full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately 387.1 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering costs of approximately 5.0 million. We used the net proceeds for acquisitions.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had 50.0 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in July 2026, 50.0 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in October 2027, 100.0 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in July 2028, 100.0 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in December 2029, 125.0 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in August 2030, and 50.0 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in July 2031 (collectively, the Senior Unsecured Notes ). 
 In July 2024, we repaid the 100.0 million tranche of 7-year Senior Unsecured Notes using existing cash on hand. The notes bore interest at 3.8 and had an original maturity date of July 14, 2024. 
 On September 24, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Sixth Amended and Restated Senior Credit Agreement (as amended, the Amended Facility in order to, among other things, (i) increase the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility by 200.0 million to 600.0 million and (ii) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from August 2025 to January 2029. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 The Amended Facility consists of a 600.0 million revolving credit facility that matures in January 2029, a 100.0 million term loan that matures in January 2027 and a 100.0 million term loan that matures in January 2028. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility and 200.0 million of borrowings outstanding on the term loans. 
 The aggregate amount of the Amended Facility may be increased by up to an additional 450.0 million to a maximum amount not to exceed 1.25 billion, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the identification of lenders willing to make available additional amounts. Outstanding borrowings under the Amended Facility are limited to the lesser of (i) the sum of the 600.0 million revolving credit facility, the 100.0 million term loan maturing in January 2027 and the 100.0 million term loan maturing in January 2028, or (ii) 60.0 of the value of the unencumbered properties. Interest on the Amended Facility, including the term loans, is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus the applicable SOFR margin or (ii) the applicable base rate, which is the greatest of the administrative agent s prime rate, 0.50 above the federal funds effective rate, thirty-day SOFR plus the applicable SOFR margin for SOFR rate loans under the Amended Facility plus 1.25 , or 1.25 per annum. The applicable SOFR margin will range from 1.10 to 1.55 (1.10 as of September 30, 2024) for the revolving credit facility and 1.25 to 1.75 (1.25 as of September 30, 2024) for the term loans, depending on the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value and includes a 10 basis points SOFR credit adjustment. The Amended Facility requires quarterly payments of an annual facility fee in an amount ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 , depending on the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value. 
 The Amended Facility and the Senior Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by us and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the borrower that own an unencumbered property. The Amended Facility and the Senior Unsecured Notes are not secured by our properties or by interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties. The Amended Facility and the Senior Unsecured Notes include a series of financial and other covenants with which we must comply. We were in compliance with the covenants under the Amended Facility and the Senior Unsecured Notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately 243.7 million and 165.4 million, respectively.

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our principal sources of cash are cash from operations, borrowings under loans payable, draws on our Amended Facility, common and preferred stock issuances, proceeds from property dispositions and issuances of unsecured notes. Our principal uses of cash are asset acquisitions, developments and redevelopments, debt service, capital expenditures, operating costs, corporate overhead costs and common stock dividends. 
 Cash From Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately 181.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 140.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to additional cash flows generated from the properties acquired during 2024 and 2023 and increased rents on new and renewed leases at our same store properties. 
 Cash From Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately 605.4 million and 479.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which consisted primarily of cash paid for property acquisitions of approximately 476.8 million and 392.5 million, respectively, additions to capital improvements of approximately 138.8 million and 111.7 million, respectively, and was partially offset by proceeds from sales of real estate investments of approximately 10.2 million and 24.6 million, respectively. 
 Cash From Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 501.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of approximately 737.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by approximately 126.1 million in equity dividend payments and payment of a 100.0 million tranche of the Senior Unsecured Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 411.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted primarily of approximately 510.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by approximately 97.4 million in equity dividend payments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates 
 A summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in the condensed notes to consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Material Cash Commitments 
 As of November 5, 2024, we had two outstanding contracts with third-party sellers to acquire two industrial properties for a total price of 163.9 million. In addition, we have a commitment to assume existing debt of approximately 72.9 million secured by one of the properties. There is no assurance that we will acquire the properties under contract because the proposed acquisitions are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence and various closing conditions.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance: funds from operations, or FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, net operating income, or NOI, same store NOI, cash-basis same store NOI and net debt. FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, same store NOI, cash-basis same store NOI and net debt should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. Further, our computation of FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, same store NOI, cash-basis same store NOI and net debt may not be comparable to FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, same store NOI, cash-basis same store NOI and net debt reported by other companies. 
 We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), which defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of property and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures (which are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis). We believe that presenting FFO provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets. 
 We believe that FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance. 
 The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands except per share data):

 1 To be consistent with our policies of determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and accounting for earnings per share, the FFO per common share is adjusted for FFO distributed through declared dividends (if any) and allocated to all participating securities (weighted average common shares outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding) under the two-class method. Under this method, allocations were made to 422,856 and 404,010 of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding for the three

 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 430,782 and 384,239 of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 FFO increased by approximately 12.1 million and 34.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods from the prior year due primarily to property acquisitions during 2023 and 2024 as well as same store NOI growth of approximately 1.8 million and 7.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods from the prior year. The FFO increase was partially offset by increased weighted average common shares outstanding and increased general and administrative expenses due to increased restricted stock amortization and other compensation expenses, including an increase in bonus expense and an increase in the number of employees and salaries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods from the prior year. 
 We compute Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sales of real estate investments, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of tax, gain (loss) on sales of real estate investments, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation. By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure our operating performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for more meaningful comparison of our operating performance between quarters and other interim periods as well as annual periods and for the comparison of our operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. As we are currently in a growth phase, acquisition costs are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA to allow for the comparison of our operating performance to that of stabilized companies. 
 The following table reflects the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA reconciled from net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

 We compute NOI as rental revenues, including tenant expense reimbursements, less property operating expenses. We compute same store NOI as rental revenues, including tenant expense reimbursements, less property operating expenses on a same store basis. NOI excludes depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs and interest expense, including amortization. We compute cash-basis same store NOI as same store NOI excluding straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles. The same store pool includes all properties that were owned and in operation as of September 30, 2024 and since January 1, 2023 and excludes properties that were either disposed of prior to, held for sale to a third party or in development or redevelopment as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the same store pool consisted of 243 buildings aggregating approximately 14.6 million square feet representing approximately 79.8 of our total square feet owned and 44 improved land parcels containing approximately 145.3 acres representing approximately 95.3 of our total acreage owned. We believe that presenting NOI, same store NOI and cash-basis same store NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the operating performance of our properties because NOI excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties, such as depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs and interest expense. By presenting same store NOI and cash-basis same store NOI, the operating results on a same store basis are directly comparable from period to period.

 3 Includes straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. 
 
 Cash-basis same store NOI increased by approximately 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to increased rental revenue on new and renewed leases and contractual rent increases on pre-existing leases. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total contractual rent abatements of approximately 0.4 million and 0.6 million, respectively, were given to certain tenants in the same store pool and approximately 10,000 and 0.1 million, respectively, in lease termination income was received from certain tenants in the same store pool. In addition, approximately 0.9 million of the increase in cash-basis same store NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to properties that were acquired vacant or with near term expirations in 2022. The increase in cash-basis same store NOI was partially offset by a decrease in same store occupancy for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year. Additionally, total cash-basis same store NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was partially offset by approximately 0.1 million and 25,100, respectively, of bad debt write-offs in the same store pool. 
 Cash-basis same store NOI increased by approximately 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year primarily due to increased rental revenue on new and renewed leases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total contractual rent abatements of approximately 1.1 million and 4.1 million, respectively, were given to certain tenants in the same-store pool and approximately 0.5 million and 0.2 million, respectively, in lease termination income was received from certain tenants in the same store pool. In addition, approximately

 2.6 million of the increase in cash-basis same store NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to properties that were acquired vacant or with near term expirations in 2022. The increase in cash-basis same store NOI was partially offset by a decrease in same store occupancy for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period from the prior year. Additionally, total cash-basis same store NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was partially offset by approximately 0.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively, of bad debt write-offs in the same store pool. 
 We compute net debt as total debt, less deferred financing costs and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that presenting net debt provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to repay our outstanding consolidated indebtedness. See Debt Sources of Liquidity in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of net debt from total debt. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business strategies, the primary market risk which we are exposed to is interest rate risk. We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to maintain liquidity, fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfolio and operations. We seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. As described below, some of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates, and we expect that some of our future outstanding debt will have variable interest rates. We may use interest rate caps and/or swap agreements to manage our interest rate risks relating to our variable rate debt. We expect to replace variable rate debt on a regular basis with fixed rate, long-term debt to finance our assets and operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our Amended Facility, none of which were subject to interest rate caps. Amounts borrowed under our Amended Facility bear interest at a variable rate based on SOFR plus an applicable SOFR margin. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our Amended Facility was 6.3 as of September 30, 2024. If the SOFR rate were to fluctuate by 0.25 , interest expense would increase or decrease, depending on rate movement, future earnings and cash flows by approximately 0.5 million annually on the total of the outstanding balances on our Amended Facility as of September 30, 2024.
