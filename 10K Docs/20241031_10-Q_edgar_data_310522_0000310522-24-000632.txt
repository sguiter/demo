 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report and the more detailed information in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ). You can find a Glossary of Terms Used in This Report in MD A in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 This report includes forward-looking statements based on management s current expectations that are subject to significant uncertainties. Future events and our results may differ materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report and in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 About Fannie Mae 
 
 Fannie Mae is a leading source of financing for residential mortgages in the United States. We provided 273.9 billion in liquidity to the mortgage market in the first nine months of 2024, which enabled the financing of approximately 993,000 home purchases, refinancings, and rental units. 
 We are a government-sponsored, stockholder-owned corporation, chartered by Congress to provide liquidity and stability to the U.S. housing market and to promote access to mortgage credit. We primarily do this by buying residential mortgage loans that are originated by lenders. We place these loans into trusts and issue guaranteed mortgage-backed securities MBS or Fannie Mae MBS that global investors buy from us. We do not originate mortgage loans or lend money directly to borrowers. 
 We support both single-family and multifamily housing. Our Single-Family business provides financing for properties that have four or fewer residential units. Our Multifamily business provides financing for residential buildings with five or more units. As of June 30, 2024 (the latest date for which information is available), Fannie Mae owned or guaranteed an estimated 26 of single-family mortgage debt outstanding and an estimated 21 of multifamily mortgage debt outstanding in the United States. 
 We provide a guaranty on the MBS that we issue. If a borrower fails to make a payment on a mortgage loan that is included in a Fannie Mae MBS, we pay the shortfall amount to the MBS investor. In exchange for providing this guaranty, we receive a guaranty fee. Guaranty fees are the primary source of our revenues. 
 Because we assume the credit risk for mortgage loans in our MBS, our earnings are affected by the credit performance of these loans. Credit risk management is therefore key to our business and financial results. To help manage our mortgage credit risk exposure, and in response to capital and other requirements, we transfer some of our credit risk exposure to third parties through credit risk transfer transactions and mortgage insurance. For a discussion of how we manage credit risk, see MD A Single-Family Business Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management and MD A Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management in this report and in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We are in conservatorship, with the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA as our conservator. During conservatorship, our Board has no fiduciary duties to the company or its stockholders, as they owe their fiduciary duties of care and loyalty solely to FHFA as conservator. Conservatorship and our agreements with the U.S. Department of the Treasury Treasury significantly restrict our business activities and stockholder rights. For more information about the impact of conservatorship and these agreements on our business, stockholders, and our uncertain future, see Business Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements and Risk Factors GSE and Conservatorship Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K.

MD A | Executive Summary 

 Executive Summary 
 
 Please read this summary together with our MD A, our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and the accompanying notes. 
 
 Overview of Financial Results 
 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 Quarterly Results 
 Net revenues were relatively flat in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net income decreased 655 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in fair value gains and a decrease in benefit for credit losses. 
 Year-to-Date Results 
 Net revenues increased 522 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, driven by an increase in net interest income. 
 Net income decreased 617 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in benefit for credit losses and a decrease in fair value gains. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. 
 Net worth increased to 90.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 77.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 For more information on the drivers of our financial results, see Consolidated Results of Operations. 
 
 Legislation and Regulation 
 
 The information in this section updates and supplements information regarding legislative, regulatory, conservatorship and other matters affecting our business set forth in Business Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements and Business Legislation and Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K, as well as in MD A Legislation and Regulation in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 First Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q ). Also see Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K for discussions of risks relating to legislative and regulatory matters. 
 Proposed 2025-2027 Housing Goals 
 We are subject to housing goals, which require that a specified amount of the mortgage loans we acquire meet requirements relating to affordability or location. Our housing goals are set by FHFA in accordance with the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended (the GSE Act ). In August 2024, FHFA published a proposed rule that would establish single-family and multifamily housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 2 

MD A | Legislation and Regulation 

 Mac for 2025 through 2027. Comments on the proposed rule were due in October 2024. See Risk Factors GSE and Conservatorship Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of how pursuing our housing goals may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Proposed Single-Family Housing Goals 
 Under FHFA s proposed rule, FHFA would continue to evaluate our performance against the single-family housing goals using a two-part approach that compares the goals-qualifying share of our single-family mortgage acquisitions against both a benchmark level and a market level. To meet a single-family housing goal or subgoal, the percentage of our mortgage acquisitions that meet each goal or subgoal must equal or exceed either the benchmark level set in advance by FHFA or the market level for that year. The market level is determined retrospectively each year based on actual goals-qualifying originations in the overall market as measured by Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for that year. Typically, this data is made available by the third quarter of the following year. 
 The table below sets forth the single-family housing goal benchmarks applicable to Fannie Mae for 2024, as compared with FHFA s proposed single-family housing goal benchmarks for 2025 through 2027. 
 Current and Proposed Single-Family Housing Goals 2024 Benchmark Level (1) 
 Proposed Benchmark Level 2025-2027 (1) 
 Low-income home purchase goal (2) 
 28 25 Very low-income home purchase goal (3) 
 7 6 Minority census tracts home purchase subgoal (4) 
 10 12 Low-income census tracts home purchase subgoal (5) 
 4 4 Low-income refinance goal (6) 
 26 26 
 (1) The FHFA benchmarks are expressed as a percentage of the total number of goal-eligible single-family mortgages acquired during the year. 
 (2) Home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties to borrowers with incomes no greater than 80 of area median income. 
 (3) Home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties to borrowers with incomes no greater than 50 of area median income. 
 (4) Home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties to borrowers with incomes no greater than 100 of area median income in minority census tracts. Minority census tracts are those that have a minority population of at least 30 and a median income of less than 100 of area median income. 
 (5) (i) Home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties to borrowers (regardless of income) in low-income census tracts that are not minority census tracts, and (ii) home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties to borrowers with incomes greater than 100 of area median income in low-income census tracts that are also minority census tracts. Low income census tracts are those where the median income is no greater than 80 of area median income. 
 (6) Refinance mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties to borrowers with incomes no greater than 80 of area median income. 
 The low-income areas housing goal benchmark level was not included in the proposed rule. Under the existing regulation, the benchmark level for the low-income areas home purchase goal will be the sum of the benchmark levels for the minority census tracts subgoal and the low-income census tracts subgoal established above, plus an additional amount that will be determined separately by FHFA by notice that takes into account families in disaster areas with incomes no greater than 100 of area median income. 
 The proposed rule would establish new criteria for assessing whether a housing plan would be required for failing to meet certain single-family housing goals. By statute, if FHFA determines that we did not meet a feasible housing goal, FHFA may require that we submit a housing plan describing the steps that we will take to improve our performance. Under the proposed rule, FHFA generally would not require that we submit a housing plan if our performance meets or exceeds the market level for the goal minus a specified enforcement factor. FHFA stated that the proposed enforcement factors address, in part, the uncertainty in forecasting the market several years in advance, as well as the time lag in determining the actual market level retrospectively. 
 Proposed Multifamily Housing Goals 
 Under FHFA s proposed rule, FHFA would continue to evaluate our multifamily housing goals performance against the benchmark levels only. Both the multifamily housing goal benchmarks for 2024 and FHFA s proposed multifamily housing goal benchmarks for 2025 through 2027 are based on the percentage share of the goal-eligible units in our annual multifamily loan acquisitions that are affordable to each income category. 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 3 

MD A | Legislation and Regulation 

 The table below sets forth the multifamily housing goal benchmarks applicable to Fannie Mae for 2024, as compared with FHFA s proposed multifamily housing goal benchmarks for 2025 through 2027. 
 Current and Proposed Multifamily Housing Goals 2024 Benchmark Level Proposed Benchmark Level 2025-2027 Low-income goal (1) 
 61 61 Very low-income goal (2) 
 12 14 Small multifamily low-income subgoal (3) 
 2.5 2 
 (1) Affordable to low-income families, defined as families with incomes no greater than 80 of area median income. 
 (2) Affordable to very low-income families, defined as families with incomes no greater than 50 of area median income. The current regulation refers to the very low-income housing benchmark level as a subgoal. The proposed rule would refer to it as a goal. 
 (3) Units in small multifamily properties (defined as properties with 5 to 50 units) affordable to low-income families. 
 2023 Housing Goals Performance 
 In October 2024, FHFA notified us that it had determined that we met four of our six 2023 single-family housing goals and subgoals, and all of our 2023 multifamily housing goals and subgoals. FHFA determined that we missed the single-family low-income home purchase goal and the single-family very low-income home purchase goal. FHFA also determined that we are not required to submit a housing plan as a result of the two missed single-family goals because those goals were not feasible for us to achieve for 2023. See Business Legislation and Regulation Housing Goals in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information regarding our 2023 housing goals requirements.

MD A | Key Market Economic Indicators 

 Key Market Economic Indicators 
 
 In MD A Key Market Economic Indicators in our 2023 Form 10-K, we discuss how varying macroeconomic conditions can influence our financial results across different business and economic environments, and we provide forecasts and expectations with respect to some of these macroeconomic conditions. Below we provide an update to these forecasts and expectations, as well as updates to certain macroeconomic information. Our forecasts and expectations are based on many assumptions, subject to many uncertainties and may change, perhaps substantially, from our current forecasts and expectations. See Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K and in this report for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current forecasts and expectations. 
 Interest Rates 
 Selected Benchmark Interest Rates 
 
 (1) Refers to the U.S. weekly average fixed-rate mortgage rate according to Freddie Mac s Primary Mortgage Market Survey . These rates are reported using the latest available data for a given period. 
 (2) According to Bloomberg. 
 (3) Refers to the daily rate per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate at the end of the third quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the end of the second quarter of 2024 and the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Home Prices 
 
 Single-Family Quarterly Home Price Growth (Decline) Rate (1) 

(1) Calculated internally using property data on loans purchased by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other third-party home sales data. Fannie Mae s home price index is a weighted repeat-transactions index, measuring average price changes in repeat sales on the same properties. Fannie Mae s home price index excludes prices on properties sold in foreclosure. Fannie Mae s home price growth rates represent estimates based on non-seasonally adjusted preliminary data and are subject to change as additional data becomes available. 
 Home prices on a national basis grew by an estimated 5.9 in the first nine months of 2024. Based on our expectation of a slight decrease in home prices in the fourth quarter of 2024, we forecast national home price growth of 5.8 for the full year of 2024. We expect regional variation in the timing and rate of home price changes. 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 5 

MD A | Key Market Economic Indicators 

 Housing Activity 
 New Housing Starts (1) 
 
 (1) According to the U.S. Census Bureau and subject to revision. 
 Single-family housing starts decreased modestly in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. We expect single-family housing starts will be higher in 2024 overall compared to 2023 due to elevated demand for new single-family housing. 
 We expect a decline in multifamily housing starts in 2024 overall compared to 2023, due to the large amount of new rental units expected to be completed in 2024. 
 For further discussion on housing activity, see Single-Family Business Single-Family Mortgage Market and Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Market. 
 Economic Activity 
 GDP and Unemployment Rate 
 
 (1) Real GDP growth (decline) is based on the quarterly series calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and is subject to revision. 
 (2) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and subject to revision. 
 U.S. gross domestic product GDP increased in the first nine months of 2024. The unemployment rate increased in the first nine months of 2024, and we expect it to continue to increase modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 See Risk Factors Market and Industry Risk and Risk Factors Credit Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of risks to our business and financial results associated with interest rates, home prices, housing activity, and economic conditions.

 Net Interest Income 
 Overview 
 Our primary source of net interest income is guaranty fees we receive for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties in our guaranty book of business. We also recognize net interest income on the difference between interest income earned on the assets in our retained mortgage portfolio and our corporate liquidity portfolio (collectively, our portfolios and the interest expense associated with our funding debt. In addition, income or expense from hedge accounting is a component of our net interest income. See MD A Consolidated Results of Operations Net Interest Income in our 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the components of our single-family and multifamily guaranty fees and the components of our net interest income from our guaranty book of business, portfolios, and hedge accounting.

 (5) For more information about our hedge accounting program, see Note 9, Derivative Instruments. 
 Net interest income remained relatively flat in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. Higher income from base guaranty fees and lower expense from hedge accounting was substantially offset by lower net deferred guaranty fee income. 
 Higher base guaranty fee income . Higher average remitted guaranty fees on new acquisitions in our single-family guaranty book of business was the primary driver of the increase in base guaranty fee income in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. 
 Lower expense from hedge accounting . We had lower expense from hedge accounting in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by lower interest expense on derivatives in hedging relationships in the third quarter of 2024 than in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Lower net deferred guaranty fee income. Net amortization income decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a lower balance of net unamortized deferred guaranty fees. See Analysis of Unamortized Deferred Guaranty Fees below for additional information. 
 Net interest income increased in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily as a result of higher base guaranty fee income and higher net interest income from portfolios, partially offset by lower net deferred guaranty fee income. 
 Higher base guaranty fee income . Higher average remitted guaranty fees on new acquisitions in our single-family guaranty book of business was the primary driver of the increase in base guaranty fee income in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023. 
 Higher net interest income from portfolios. Higher net interest income from portfolios in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by higher interest rates in the first nine months of 2024 than in the first nine months of 2023 on securities in our corporate liquidity portfolio, primarily securities purchased under agreements to resell. 
 Lower net deferred guaranty fee income. Net amortization income decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to a lower balance of unamortized deferred guaranty fees.

 Analysis of Unamortized Deferred Guaranty Fees 
 The following charts present information about the interest rates of the loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business as well as information about our deferred guaranty fees. 
 As shown in the chart below (on the left), most of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business as of September 30, 2024 had an interest rate lower than the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate. Per Freddie Mac s Primary Mortgage Market Survey , as of September 26, 2024, the U.S. weekly average interest rate for a single-family 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.08 . Accordingly, even if interest rates decline meaningfully, most of the borrowers whose mortgage loans are in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business still would not be incentivized to refinance. 
 The other chart below (on the right) presents guaranty fees that will be amortized into deferred guaranty fee income in future periods, which we refer to as unamortized deferred guaranty fees, as described in MD A Consolidated Results of Operations Net Interest Income Analysis of Unamortized Deferred Guaranty Fees in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Interest Rates of Single-Family Conventional Guaranty Book of Business Compared with Average 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage Rate 
 Unamortized Deferred Guaranty Fees (1) 
 As of September 30, 2024 (Dollars in billions) 
 
 Represents the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate as of September 26, 2024, according to Freddie Mac s Primary Mortgage Market Survey , the last published rate for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. 
 (1) Represents the net unamortized cost basis adjustments (consisting of premiums and discounts on single-family and multifamily mortgage loans and debt of consolidated trusts) that will be recognized through deferred guaranty fee income over the remaining contractual life of the mortgage loans or debt. Although we are in a net premium position for both mortgage loans and debt of consolidated trusts, we have a greater amount of premiums with respect to debt of consolidated trusts. Primarily as a result of the upfront fees we charge, the net amortization of these cost basis adjustments will result in income. Represents the percentage of single-family conventional guaranty book of business by select interest rate band based on the current interest rate of the mortgage loans. 
 
 The amount of deferred guaranty fee income we record can vary and is primarily impacted by: (1) the amount of upfront fees we charge on single-family mortgage loans, and (2) changes in interest rates, which affect the premiums and discounts we record on newly acquired mortgage loans and newly created debt of consolidated trusts. The balance of our unamortized deferred guaranty fees decreased as of September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, largely as a result of amortization of existing premiums on debt of consolidated trusts. In addition, interest-rate-driven pricing changes have increased the premiums on newly acquired loans, which further reduced the balance of unamortized deferred guaranty fees.

 Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net 
 The estimated fair value of our derivatives, trading securities and other financial instruments carried at fair value may fluctuate substantially from period to period because of changes in interest rates, the yield curve, mortgage and credit spreads and implied volatility, as well as activity related to these financial instruments. 
 The table below displays the components of our fair value gains and losses.

 (3) Consists primarily of fair value gains and losses on mortgage loans held at fair value. 
 Fair value gains, net in the third quarter of 2024 were driven by gains on fixed-rate trading securities, which were substantially offset by losses on mortgage commitment derivatives, long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value, and risk management derivatives, all of which were primarily due to declining interest rates in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Fair value gains, net in the first nine months of 2024 were driven by: 
 gains on fixed-rate trading securities and risk management derivatives, partially offset by 
 losses on long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value and mortgage commitment derivatives. 
 Declining interest rates during the third quarter of 2024 drove gains on fixed-rate trading securities, losses on long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value, and losses on mortgage commitment derivatives. Rising rates in the first half of 2024 drove gains on risk management derivatives, which were partially offset by losses in the third quarter of 2024 as rates declined. 
 Fair value gains, net in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 were primarily driven by gains on mortgage commitment derivatives, risk management derivatives, and long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value, primarily due to rising interest rates. 
 These gains were partially offset by the impact of declining prices of fixed-rate trading securities, primarily driven by rising interest rates.

 Single-Family Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses 
 Our single-family benefit for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a benefit from forecasted home price growth and a benefit from actual and projected interest rates, partially offset by a provision from changes in loan activity, as described below. Additionally, our allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2024 considers the potential impact of Hurricane Helene. 
 Benefit from forecasted home price growth. During the third quarter of 2024, our forecast of future home prices improved. Higher home prices decrease the likelihood that loans will default and reduce the amount of losses on loans that do default, which impacts our estimate of losses and ultimately reduces our loss reserves and provision for credit losses. See Key Market Economic Indicators in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information about how home prices affect our credit loss estimates. See Key Market Economic Indicators in this report for a discussion of home price growth and our home price forecast. Also see Critical Accounting Estimates in this report for more information about our home price forecast. 
 Benefit from actual and projected interest rates. Actual and projected interest rates decreased in the third quarter of 2024, which reduced the probability of default, resulting in a benefit for credit losses. 
 Provision from changes in loan activity. This includes provision on newly acquired loans and was primarily driven by the credit risk profile of our single-family acquisitions for the third quarter of 2024, which primarily consisted of purchase loans. Purchase loans generally have higher origination loan-to-value LTV ratios than refinance loans; therefore, purchase loans have a higher estimated risk of default and loss severity in the allowance than refinance loans and a correspondingly higher credit loss provision at the time of acquisition. 
 Our single-family benefit for credit losses in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by a benefit from actual and forecasted home price growth, partially offset by a provision from changes in loan activity. 
 Benefit from actual and forecasted home price growth. During the first nine months of 2024, actual home prices appreciated more than originally projected and our forecast of future home prices also improved. 
 Provision from changes in loan activity. This includes provision on newly acquired loans and was primarily driven by the credit risk profile of our single-family acquisitions for the first nine months of 2024, which primarily consisted of purchase loans. 
 Our single-family benefit for credit losses in the third quarter of 2023 and first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by a benefit from actual and forecasted home price growth, partially offset by a provision relating to the redesignation of loans from HFI to HFS and a provision from changes in loan activity, as described below: 
 Benefit from actual and forecasted home price growth. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we observed stronger than expected actual and forecasted home price appreciation. 
 Provision from redesignation of loans from HFI to HFS. We redesignated certain nonperforming and reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS, as we no longer intended to hold them for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Upon redesignation of these loans, we recorded the loans at the lower of cost or fair value with a write-off against the allowance for loan losses. During the third quarter of 2023, we redesignated loans with an amortized cost of 3.1 billion with an associated write-off against the allowance for loan losses of 638 million. Interest rates on the redesignated loans were below current market interest rates, and as a result, we recorded additional provision for credit losses to the extent that the carrying value of the loans exceeded their fair value at the time of redesignation. 
 Provision from changes in loan activity. This includes provision on newly acquired loans and was primarily driven by an increase of the portion of our single-family acquisitions consisting of purchase loans. 
 Multifamily Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses 
 Our multifamily provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was largely driven by certain adjustable-rate conventional loans that were written down to the net recoverable amount during the period. We also recognized provision for credit losses because, compared to our previous forecast, our current period forecast expects further slight decreases in projected multifamily property values and a longer period of time for projected multifamily property values to improve. 
 Our multifamily allowance and estimate for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 also considers uncertainty. This includes uncertainty relating to multifamily property values, as well as uncertainty due to the ongoing investigation of multifamily lending transactions with suspected fraud, which may increase the risk of default. See Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management Multifamily Guaranty Book Diversification and Monitoring for additional information about multifamily lending transactions in which fraud may have occurred. 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 14 

MD A | Consolidated Results of Operations 

 Our multifamily provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by loan delinquencies in our multifamily guaranty book of business, including provision attributable to adjustable-rate conventional loans that became seriously delinquent and were written down to the net recoverable amount, declines in estimated actual and projected multifamily property values, and provision for uncertainty described above. Provision related to uncertainty is included in Other in the table above and provision attributable to multifamily property values, including changes to the timing of recoveries, is included in Actual and projected economic data in the table above. 
 The largest driver of our multifamily provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2023 was a provision for actual and projected interest rates. Rising interest rates increase the likelihood that loans with balloon balances due at maturity will be unable to refinance, due to higher refinancing rates. In addition, rising interest rates increase costs for loans with adjustable-rates, which increases the expected impairment and the provision for credit losses on these loans. 
 The impact of this factor was offset by a benefit from actual and projected economic data in the third quarter of 2023. The benefit from actual and projected economic data was primarily driven by the impact of a change in our long-term economic forecast assumptions, which was partially offset by continued declines in multifamily property values. 
 Our multifamily provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by actual and projected interest rates as described above. 
 
 Other Expenses, Net 
 Other expenses, net consists of debt extinguishment gains and losses, expenses associated with legal claims, foreclosed property income (expense), gains and losses from partnership investments, housing trust fund expenses, loan subservicing costs, and servicer fees paid in connection with certain loss mitigation activities. During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized 491 million of expense attributable to a jury verdict and an award of prejudgment interest for Fannie Mae preferred shareholders in two cases consolidated for trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

 Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in prepayments of loans held in consolidated trusts, resulting in higher cash balances held in trust at period-end. 
 Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Investments in Securities, at Fair Value 
 The primary driver of the increase in investments in securities, at fair value, as well as the decrease in securities purchased under agreements to resell, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, was a shift to investing the proceeds of funding debt issued during the third quarter of 2024 in longer-term U.S. Treasury securities, rather than investing those funds in securities purchased under agreements to resell. See Liquidity and Capital Management Liquidity Management Corporate Liquidity Portfolio for additional information. 
 
 Mortgage Loans, Net of Allowance 
 The mortgage loans reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets are classified as either HFS or HFI and include loans owned by Fannie Mae and loans held in consolidated trusts. 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 16 

MD A | Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis 

 Mortgage loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, driven primarily by acquisitions outpacing loan paydowns, liquidations and sales during the first nine months of 2024, as well as a decline in our allowance for loan losses. 
 For additional information on our mortgage loans, see Note 4, Mortgage Loans, and for additional information on changes in our allowance for loan losses, see Note 5, Allowance for Loan Losses. 
 Debt 
 The decrease in debt of Fannie Mae from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was due to redemptions outpacing new issuances. The decrease in debt of consolidated trusts from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by liquidations of Fannie Mae MBS outpacing issuances. See Liquidity and Capital Management Liquidity Management Debt Funding for a summary of activity in debt of Fannie Mae and information on our outstanding short-term and long-term debt. Also see Note 8, Short-Term and Long-Term Debt for additional information on our total outstanding debt. 
 Stockholders Equity 
 Our stockholders equity (also referred to as our net worth) increased to 90.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared with 77.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, due to the 12.8 billion in comprehensive income recognized during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Retained Mortgage Portfolio 
 
 We use our retained mortgage portfolio primarily to provide liquidity to the mortgage market through portfolio securitization transactions and to support our loss mitigation activities. 
 Our retained mortgage portfolio consists of mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities that we own, including Fannie Mae MBS and non-Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities. Assets held by consolidated MBS trusts that back mortgage-related securities owned by third parties are not included in our retained mortgage portfolio. 
 We separate the instruments within our retained mortgage portfolio into three categories based on each instrument s use: 
 Lender liquidity , which includes balances related to our portfolio securitization activity, supports our efforts to provide liquidity to the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets. 
 Loss mitigation supports our loss mitigation efforts through the purchase of delinquent loans from our MBS trusts. 
 Other represents assets that we previously purchased for investment purposes.

 (1) Consists of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae mortgage-related securities, including Freddie Mac securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae. Excludes Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae reverse mortgage securities and Fannie Mae-wrapped private-label securities. 
 (2) Includes single-family loans on nonaccrual status of 9.8 billion and 8.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Also includes multifamily loans on nonaccrual status of 2.9 billion and 2.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (3) Includes Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae reverse mortgage securities. We stopped acquiring newly originated reverse mortgage loans in 2010. 
 (4) Other mortgage loans primarily includes multifamily loans on accrual status and single-family loans that are not included in the loss mitigation or lender liquidity categories. Other mortgage securities primarily includes private-label securities and mortgage revenue bonds. 
 The amount of mortgage assets that we may own is capped at 225 billion under the terms of our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury. In addition, we are currently required to cap our mortgage assets at 202.5 billion per instructions from FHFA. We include 10 of the notional value of the interest-only securities we hold in calculating the size of the retained mortgage portfolio for the purpose of determining compliance with the senior preferred stock purchase agreement mortgage assets cap and associated FHFA instructions. As of September 30, 2024, 10 of the notional value of our interest-only securities was 1.6 billion, which is not included in the table above. 
 
 Under the terms of our MBS trust documents, we have the option or, in some instances, the obligation, to purchase mortgage loans that meet specific criteria from an MBS trust. The purchase price for these loans is the unpaid principal balance of the loans plus accrued interest. If a delinquent loan remains in a single-family MBS trust, the servicer is responsible for advancing the borrower s missed scheduled principal and interest payments to the MBS holders for up to four months, after which time we must make these missed payments. In addition, we must reimburse servicers for advanced principal and interest payments. 
 In support of our loss mitigation strategies, we purchased 9.6 billion of loans from our single-family MBS trusts in the first nine months of 2024, the substantial majority of which were delinquent, compared with 6.9 billion of loans purchased from single-family MBS trusts in the first nine months of 2023.

MD A | Guaranty Book of Business 

 Guaranty Book of Business 
 
 Our guaranty book of business consists of: 
 Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, excluding the portions of any structured securities we issue that are backed by Freddie Mac securities; 
 mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio; and 
 other credit enhancements that we provide on mortgage assets. 
 Total Fannie Mae guarantees consists of: 
 our guaranty book of business; and 
 the portions of any structured securities we issue that are backed by Freddie Mac securities. 
 We and Freddie Mac issue single-family uniform mortgage-backed securities, or UMBS. We use the term Fannie Mae MBS or our MBS to refer to any type of mortgage-backed security that we issue, including UMBS , Supers , Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit securities REMICs and other types of single-family or multifamily mortgage-backed securities. 
 Some Fannie Mae MBS that we issue are backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities. When we resecuritize Freddie Mac securities into Fannie Mae-issued structured securities, such as Supers and REMICs, our guaranty of principal and interest extends to the underlying Freddie Mac securities. However, Freddie Mac continues to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have resecuritized. References to our single-family guaranty book of business exclude Freddie Mac-acquired mortgage loans underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have resecuritized. 
 Our issuance of structured securities backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities creates additional off-balance sheet exposure. Our guaranty extends to the underlying Freddie Mac security included in the structured security, but we do not have control over the Freddie Mac mortgage loan securitizations. Because we do not have the power to direct matters (primarily the servicing of mortgage loans) that impact the credit risk to which we are exposed, which constitute control of these securitization trusts, we do not consolidate these trusts in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, giving rise to off-balance sheet exposure. See Liquidity and Capital Management Liquidity Management Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Note 7, Financial Guarantees for information regarding our maximum exposure to loss on unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS and Freddie Mac securities.

 New Business and Affordable Housing Allocations 
 The GSE Act requires us to set aside each year an amount equal to 4.2 basis points of the unpaid principal balance of our new business purchases and to pay this amount to specified U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD and Treasury funds in support of affordable housing. In March 2024, we paid 155 million to the funds based on 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 19 

MD A | Guaranty Book of Business 

 our new business purchases in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, we recognized an expense of 115 million related to this obligation based on 273.9 billion in new business purchases during the period. We expect to pay this amount to the funds in 2025, plus additional amounts to be accrued based on our new business purchases in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Business Segments 
 
 We have two reportable business segments: Single-Family and Multifamily. The chart below displays net revenues and net income for each of our business segments for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023.

 Single-Family Mortgage Market 
 Total housing activity decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the second quarter of 2024. Existing home sales averaged 3.89 million units annualized in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 4.05 million units in the second quarter of 2024, according to data from the National Association of REALTORS . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, new single-family home sales averaged an annualized rate of approximately 724,000 units in the third quarter of 2024, compared with approximately 693,000 units in the second quarter of 2024. 
 The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.08 as of September 26, 2024, compared with 6.86 as of June 27, 2024, and averaged 6.51 in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 7.00 in the second quarter of 2024, according to Freddie Mac s Primary Mortgage Market Survey . 
 Single-family mortgage market originations increased modestly from an estimated 411 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to an estimated 443 billion in the third quarter of 2024. According to the October forecast from our Economic and Strategic Research Group, total originations in the U.S. single-family mortgage market in 2024 are forecasted to increase from 2023 levels by approximately 11 , from an estimated 1.50 trillion in 2023 to 1.67 trillion in 2024, and the amount of refinance originations in the U.S. single-family mortgage market are forecasted to increase from an estimated 221 billion in 2023 to 368 billion in 2024. Our Economic and Strategic Research Group s October forecast is based on data available as of October 11, 2024. See Key Market Economic Indicators in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion of how housing activity can affect our financial results and the uncertainties that may affect our forecasts and expectations.

 Single-Family Mortgage-Related Securities Issuances Share 
 Our single-family Fannie Mae MBS issuances were 92.3 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 87.6 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Based on the latest data available, the charts below display our estimated share of single-family mortgage-related securities issuances as compared with that of our primary competitors for the issuance of single-family mortgage-related securities for the periods indicated. 
 Single-Family Mortgage-Related Securities Issuances Share 

Ginnie Mae Private-label securities Fannie Mae Freddie Mac 
 For several quarters, we have faced increased competition for the acquisition of single-family mortgage assets, which has impacted our share of single-family loan acquisitions and, in turn, our share of single-family mortgage-related securities issuances. 
 Our market share is impacted by different variables such as our pricing of single-family loans and the competitive market environment. Decisions regarding the pricing and acquisition of single-family loans incorporate different, and sometimes competing, factors, as discussed in MD A Single-Family Business Single-Family Mortgage-Related Securities Issuances Share in our First Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. For a discussion of factors that affect or could affect our business, our competitive environment, demand for our MBS, or the liquidity and market value of our MBS, as well as the risks associated with our conservatorship, our capital requirements relative to that of our primary competitor, our housing goals, the UMBS market and the performance of our MBS, see Business Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements, Business Legislation and Regulation, Risk Factors and MD A Single-Family Business Single-Family Competition in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Single-family conventional acquisitions 
 (1) For information reported in this Single-Family Business section, our single-family conventional guaranty book of business is measured using the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. By contrast, the single-family conventional guaranty book of business presented in the Composition of Fannie Mae Guaranty Book of Business table in the Guaranty Book of Business section is based on the unpaid principal balance of the Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, rather than the unpaid principal balance of the underlying mortgage loans. These amounts differ primarily as a result of payments we receive on underlying loans that have not yet been paid to the MBS holders or instances where we have advanced missed borrower payments on mortgage loans to make required distributions to related MBS holders. As measured for purposes of the information reported in this section, our single-family conventional guaranty book of business was 3,627.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 3,636.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 (2) Excludes the impact of a 10 basis point guaranty fee increase implemented pursuant to the TCCA, the incremental revenue from which is paid to Treasury and not retained by us. 
 (3) Our single-family conventional guaranty book of business primarily consists of single-family conventional mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. It also includes single-family conventional mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio, and other credit enhancements that we provide on single-family conventional mortgage assets. Our single-family conventional guaranty book of business does not include: (a) mortgage loans guaranteed or insured, in whole or in part, by the U.S. government; (b) Freddie Mac-acquired mortgage loans underlying Freddie Mac-issued UMBS that we have resecuritized; or (c) non-Fannie Mae single-family mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio for which we do not provide a guaranty. Our average single-family conventional guaranty book of business is based on the average of quarter-end balances. 
 Our single-family conventional loan acquisition volumes remained at low levels in the third quarter of 2024. While interest rates decreased in the third quarter of 2024, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate during the quarter still remained higher than the interest rates of most outstanding single-family loans, resulting in low refinance volumes. In addition, housing affordability constraints and limited supply continued to put downward pressure on the volume of purchase loans we acquired. 
 Average charged guaranty fee on newly acquired conventional single-family loans is a metric management uses to measure the amount we earn as compensation for the credit risk we manage and to assess our return. Average charged guaranty fee represents, on an annualized basis, the average of the base guaranty fees charged during the period for our single-family conventional guaranty arrangements, which we receive monthly over the life of the loan, plus the recognition of any upfront cash payments, including loan-level price adjustments, based on an estimated average life at the time of acquisition. Our average charged guaranty fee on newly acquired conventional single-family loans, net of TCCA fees remained relatively flat in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023.

 (2) Reflects the impact of a 10 basis point guaranty fee increase implemented pursuant to the TCCA, the incremental revenue from which is paid to Treasury. The resulting revenue is included in Net interest income and the expense is recognized as TCCA fees. 
 (3) Includes estimated changes in benefits, as well as any realized amounts, from our single-family freestanding credit enhancements, which primarily relate to our CAS and CIRT programs. 
 (4) Includes debt extinguishment gains and losses, expenses associated with legal claims, foreclosed property income (expense), gains and losses from partnership investments, housing trust fund expenses, loan subservicing costs, and servicer fees paid in connection with certain loss mitigation activities. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Single-family net interest income remained relatively flat for the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. Higher income from base guaranty fees and lower expense from hedge accounting was substantially offset by lower net deferred guaranty fee income. 
 The increase in single-family net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023 was primarily as a result of higher base guaranty fee income and higher net interest income from portfolios, partially offset by lower net deferred guaranty fee income. 
 The drivers of net interest income for the Single-Family segment are consistent with the drivers of net interest income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. See Consolidated Results of Operations Net Interest Income for more information on the factors that impact our single-family net interest income. 
 Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net 
 Fair value losses, net in the third quarter of 2024 were primarily driven by losses on mortgage commitment derivatives, long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value and risk management derivatives, all of which were primarily due to falling interest rates during the third quarter of 2024 . These fair value losses were substantially offset by fair value gains on fixed-rate trading securities during the third quarter of 2024 , which were also primarily due to falling interest rates during the third quarter of 2024 . 
 Fair value gains, net in the first nine months of 2024 were driven by gains on fixed-rate trading securities and risk man agement derivatives, partially offset by losses on long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value and mortgage commitment derivatives. 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 23 

MD A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Business Financial Results 

 Fair value gains, net in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 were primarily driven by gains on mortgage commitment derivatives, risk management derivatives, and long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value, primarily due to rising interest rates. These gains were partially offset by the impact of declining prices of fixed-rate trading securities, primarily driven by rising interest rates. 
 The drivers of fair value gains and losses for the Single-Family segment are generally consistent with the drivers of fair value gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, which we discuss in Consolidated Results of Operations Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net. 
 Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses 
 See Consolidated Results of Operations Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses for a discussion of our single-family benefit for credit losses. 
 Other Expenses, Net 
 During the third quarter of 2023, other expenses, net included litigation expense attributable to a jury verdict and an award of prejudgment interest for Fannie Mae preferred shareholders, of which 437 million was allocated to the Single-Family business segment. 
 
 Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management

For additional information on our single-family acquisition and servicing policies, underwriting and servicing standards, quality control process, repurchase requests, and representation and warranty framework, see MD A Single-Family Business Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Single-Family Acquisition and Servicing Policies and Underwriting and Servicing Standards 
 Desktop Underwriter Update 
 As part of our comprehensive risk management approach, we periodically update our proprietary automated underwriting system, Desktop Underwriter DU ), to reflect changes to our underwriting and eligibility guidelines. In March 2024, we implemented updates to DU to allow lenders to use a single 12-month asset verification report in the DU validation service to identify recurring deposits in the applicant s digital bank statement data to automatically validate income and employment, as well as assets, in one step. The same report also can be used to identify and consider the applicant s positive rent payment and cash flow history. We believe this update may help lenders improve operational efficiency and lower costs, as well as potentially increase the number of borrowers that receive an approve/eligible recommendation in DU by assessing eligibility through rent payment identification and cash flow assessment. We will continue to closely monitor loan acquisitions and market conditions and, as appropriate, make changes to DU, including its eligibility criteria, so that the loans we acquire are consistent with our risk appetite and mission. 
 New Credit Score Models and Credit Report Requirements 
 Fannie Mae uses credit scores to establish a minimum credit threshold for mortgage lending, provide a foundation for risk-based pricing, and support disclosures to investors. We currently use the classic FICO Score from Fair Isaac Corporation as our credit score model, which FHFA has approved. 
 In October 2022, FHFA announced the validation and approval of two new credit score models for use by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: the FICO Score 10 T credit score model and the VantageScore 4.0 credit score model. Once implemented, lenders will be required to deliver both FICO Score 10 T and VantageScore 4.0 credit scores with each loan sold to us when available, replacing the classic FICO Score model. FHFA also announced in October 2022 that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will work toward changing the requirement that lenders provide credit reports from all three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. Instead, we will require lenders to provide credit reports from at least two of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (referred to as the new bi-merge credit reporting requirements). 
 In February 2024, FHFA announced updates regarding the implementation of the new credit score requirements for loans acquired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as the new bi-merge credit reporting requirements. FHFA announced that the implementation dates for both new requirements would be aligned and expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2025. FHFA also announced that, to better support market participants with this transition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would accelerate the publication of VantageScore 4.0 historical data to early in the third quarter of 2024, and in July 2024 this historical data was made available. The FHFA Director stated that synchronizing bi-merge

 credit reporting with the implementation of the new credit score model requirements will reduce complexity for market participants.

In this section of our 2023 Form 10-K, we also provide more information on the credit characteristics of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, including high-balance loans and adjustable-rate mortgages. 
 
 Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk 
 Our charter generally requires credit enhancement on any single-family conventional mortgage loan that we purchase or securitize if it has an LTV ratio over 80 at the time of purchase. We generally achieve this through primary mortgage insurance. We also enter into various other types of transactions in which we transfer mortgage credit risk to third parties. 
 Our approved monoline mortgage insurers financial ability and willingness to pay claims is an important determinant of our overall credit risk exposure. For a discussion of our exposure to and management of the counterparty credit risk associated with the providers of these credit enhancements, see MD A Risk Management Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management and Note 14, Concentrations of Credit Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 11, Concentrations of Credit Risk in this report. Also see Risk Factors Credit Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The table below displays information about loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business covered by one or more forms of credit enhancement, including mortgage insurance or a credit risk transfer transaction.

 Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk 
 In addition to primary mortgage insurance, our Single-Family business has developed other risk-sharing capabilities to transfer portions of our single-family mortgage credit risk to the private market. Our credit risk transfer transactions are generally designed to transfer a portion of the losses we expect would be incurred in an economic downturn or a stressed credit environment. Generally, loss reimbursement payments are received after the underlying property has been liquidated and all applicable proceeds, including private mortgage insurance benefits, have been applied to reduce the loss. As described in MD A Single-Family Business Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk Credit Risk Transfer Transactions in our 2023 Form 10-K, our two primary single-family credit risk transfer programs are Connecticut Avenue Securities CAS and Credit Insurance Risk Transfer CIRT ). 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we transferred a portion of the mortgage credit risk on single-family mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of 178.4 billion at the time of the transactions. When engaging in credit risk transfer transactions, we consider their cost, the resulting capital relief, and the overall credit risk transfer capacity of the market. The cost of our credit risk transfer transactions is impacted by macroeconomic and housing market sentiment, as well as the demand and capacity of the investors and reinsurers that support these transactions. Capacity considers both the total aggregate amount of outstanding coverage as well as the volume of new issuances available in the market. In response to these factors, we may choose to adjust the amount of first loss retained by Fannie Mae as a way to manage costs or market capacity when structuring our credit risk transfer transactions. 
 The table below displays the aggregate mortgage credit risk transferred to third parties and retained by Fannie Mae pursuant to our single-family credit risk transfer transactions. The table does not include the credit risk transferred on single-family transactions that were cancelled or terminated through September 30, 2024. The following table also excludes coverage obtained through primary mortgage insurance.

(1) Credit risk retained by Fannie Mae in CAS, CIRT and lender risk-sharing transactions. Also includes credit risk retained in CAS Credit Linked-Note transactions, which are similar to CAS REMICs except they allow us to obtain credit protection on reference pools containing seasoned loans such as Refi Plus TM loans. Tranche sizes vary across programs. 
 (2) Credit risk transferred to third parties. Tranche sizes vary across programs. 
 (3) For CAS transactions, senior includes the A-H tranche balances, which we retain, while mezzanine includes the A-1, M-1 and M-2 tranche balances, portions of which we sell. In May 2024, we created and began selling a portion of the A-1 tranches, which are senior to the M-1, M-2 and B tranches and subordinate to the A-H tranches for the allocation of losses. 
 (4) Represents customized lender-risk sharing transactions. In most transactions, lenders invest directly in a portion of the credit risk on mortgage loans they originate and/or service . 
 (5) For CIRT and some lender risk-sharing transactions, Reference Pool reflects a pool of covered loans. For CAS and some lender risk-sharing transactions, represents outstanding reference pools, not the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans. The outstanding unpaid principal balance for all loans covered by credit risk transfer programs, including all loans on which risk has been transferred in lender risk-sharing transactions, was 1,346 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 (6) For CAS transactions, First Loss represents all B tranche balances. In recent deals we have retained certain subordinated class B tranche(s) that absorb losses before the remaining class B tranches.

 The risk in force of these transactions, which refers to the maximum amount of losses that could be absorbed by credit risk transfer investors, was approximately 44 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared with approximately 42 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 The table below displays information about the credit enhancement recovery receivables we have recognized within Other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in our single-family freestanding credit enhancement receivables as of September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of a decrease in our estimate of credit losses in the first nine months of 2024. As our estimate of credit losses decreases, so does the benefit we expect to receive from our freestanding credit enhancements.

Also includes loans that were previously included in a credit risk transfer transaction but subsequently had the coverage canceled. 
 
 Single-Family Problem Loan Management 
 Our problem loan management strategies focus primarily on reducing defaults to avoid losses that would otherwise occur and pursuing foreclosure alternatives to mitigate the severity of the losses we incur. See MD A Single-Family Business Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management Single-Family Problem Loan Management in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of delinquency statistics on our problem loans, efforts undertaken to manage our problem loans, metrics regarding our loan workout activities, real estate owned REO management and other single-family credit-related information. The discussion below updates some of that information. We also provide ongoing credit performance information on loans underlying single-family Fannie Mae MBS and loans covered by single-family credit risk transfer transactions. For loans backing Fannie Mae MBS, see the Forbearance and Delinquency Dashboard available in the MBS section of our Data Dynamics tool, which is available at www.fanniemae.com/datadynamics. For loans covered by credit risk transfer transactions, see the Deal Performance Data report available in the CAS and CIRT sections of the tool. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report. Information in Data Dynamics may differ from similar measures presented in our financial statements and other public disclosures for a variety of reasons, including as a result of variations in the loan population covered, timing differences in reporting and other factors.

 Delinquency 
 The tables below display the delinquency status of loans and changes in the volume of seriously delinquent loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business based on the number of loans. Single-family seriously delinquent loans are loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the foreclosure process. Our single-family serious delinquency rate is expressed as a percentage of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business based on loan count. Management monitors the single-family serious delinquency rate as an indicator of potential future credit losses and loss mitigation activities. Serious delinquency rates are reflective of our performance in assessing and managing credit risk associated with single-family loans in our guaranty book of business. Typically, higher serious delinquency rates result in a higher allowance for loan losses. 
 Delinquency Status and Activity of Single-Family Conventional Loans 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Delinquency status: 30 to 59 days delinquent 1.02 1.06 0.95 60 to 89 days delinquent 0.26 0.26 0.23 Seriously delinquent SDQ ): 0.52 0.55 0.54 Percentage of SDQ loans that have been delinquent for more than 180 days

 Our single-family serious delinquency rate as of September 30, 2024 remained near historically low levels. We anticipate that the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton will result in an increase in our single-family serious delinquency rate in the short term. In addition, given our expectation of slower economic growth, we expect the credit performance of the loans in our single-family guaranty book of business may decline compared to recent performance, which could lead to higher delinquencies or an increase in our single-family serious delinquency rate. For information about factors that affect our single-family serious delinquency rate, see MD A Single-Family Business Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management Single-Family Problem Loan Management in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 As of September 30, 2024, the unpaid principal balance of single-family loans in forbearance was 6.3 billion, or 0.2 of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, compared with 6.9 billion, or 0.2 of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, as of December 31, 2023. We expect the balance of single-family loans in forbearance may increase as a result of the impact of recent hurricanes on borrowers. 
 The chart below displays the unpaid principal balance of our completed single-family loan workouts by type, as well as the number of loan workouts, for the first nine months of 2023 compared with the first nine months of 2024.

 (4) Calculated as the amount of sale proceeds received on disposition of REO properties during the respective periods, excluding those subject to repurchase requests made to our sellers or servicers, divided by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the related loans at the time of foreclosure. Net sales price represents the contract sales price less selling costs for the property and other charges paid by the seller at closing, and excludes the costs associated with any property repairs. 
 (5) Calculated as the amount of sale proceeds received on disposition of REO properties during the respective periods, excluding those subject to repurchase requests made to our sellers or servicers, divided by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the related loans at the time of foreclosure and costs to repair the property. Net sales price represents the contract sales price less selling costs for the property and other charges paid by the seller at closing. 
 (6) Calculated as the amount of sale proceeds received on properties sold in short sale transactions during the respective periods divided by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the related loans. Net sales price includes borrower relocation incentive payments and subordinate lien(s) negotiated payoffs. 
 Our REO net sales price to unpaid principal balance and costs to repair decreased to 91 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 97 for the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by increased costs we have incurred to repair the condition of properties. 
 
 Single-Family Credit Loss Performance Metrics and Loan Sale Performance 
 The single-family credit loss performance metrics and loan sale performance measures below present information about losses or gains we realized on our single-family loans during the periods presented. For the purposes of our single-family credit loss performance metrics, credit losses or gains represent write-offs net of recoveries and foreclosed property income or expense. The amount of these losses or gains in a given period is driven by foreclosures, pre-foreclosure sales, post-foreclosure REO activity, mortgage loan redesignations, and other events that trigger write-offs and recoveries. The single-family credit loss metrics we present are not defined terms and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses these measures to evaluate the effectiveness of our single-family credit risk management strategies in conjunction with leading indicators such as 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 35 

MD A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management 

 serious delinquency and forbearance rates, which are potential indicators of future realized single-family credit losses. We believe these measures provide useful information about our single-family credit performance and the factors that impact it. 
 The table below displays the components of our single-family credit loss performance metrics. Because sales of nonperforming and reperforming loans are a part of our credit loss mitigation strategy, we also provide information in the table below on our loan sale performance through the Gains (losses) on sales and other valuation adjustments line item.

 (4) Calculated based on the annualized amount of Net credit gains (losses), write-offs on redesignations and gains (losses) on sales and other valuation adjustments divided by the average single-family conventional guaranty book of business during the period. 
 The primary drivers of our net credit gains (losses), write-offs on redesignations and gains (losses) on sales and other valuation adjustments in the first nine months of 2024 were write-offs on loans for which collectability was no longer reasonably assured as well as foreclosed property expense due to increased repairs on the REO properties we acquired. 
 The primary driver of our net credit gains (losses), write-offs on redesignations and gains (losses) on sales and other valuation adjustments in the first nine months of 2023 was the resumption of our nonperforming and reperforming loan sales program, which resulted in an increase in write-offs on the redesignation of mortgage loans from HFI to HFS during the periods. Interest rates on loans redesignated in the third quarter of 2023 were below current market interest rates resulting in write-offs upon the redesignation.

 This section supplements and updates information regarding our Multifamily business segment in our 2023 Form 10-K. See MD A Multifamily Business in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the primary business activities, lenders, investors and competition of our Multifamily business. 
 
 Multifamily Mortgage Market 
 Multifamily market fundamentals, which include factors such as vacancy rates and rent growth, remained stable during the third quarter of 2024, due to ongoing demand and despite elevated levels of new supply entering various markets across the country. Although the national vacancy rate is estimated to have remained steady, rents increased. 
 Vacancy rates . Based on preliminary third-party data, we estimate that the national multifamily vacancy rate for institutional investment-type apartment properties remained steady at 6.0 as of September 30, 2024, the same as of June 30, 2024, but up from 5.8 as of September 30, 2023. The estimated average national multifamily vacancy rate over the last 15 years is approximately 5.8 . 
 Rents . Based on preliminary third-party data, we estimate that effective rents increased approximately 0.2 during the third quarter of 2024, compared to an increase of 1.0 during the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of 0.5 during the third quarter of 2023. 
 Vacancy rates and rents are important to loan performance because multifamily loans are generally repaid from the cash flows generated by the underlying property. Several years of low vacancy rates and rising rents helped to increase property values in most metropolitan areas, but that trend reversed starting in early 2023. Based on preliminary multifamily property sales data, transaction volumes for the first nine months of 2024 remained well below average levels. Available data suggests that multifamily property capitalization rates, the indicated rate of return on investment of a commercial property, are estimated to have declined slightly to 5.6 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 5.7 in the second quarter of 2024, and increased compared with 5.3 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Multifamily construction remains elevated. There were more than 1 million rental units underway as of September 30, 2024. Based on recent historical trends, we expect between 550,000 and 575,000 units will be completed in 2024. 
 We believe vacancy levels could rise to 6.25 later this year or in early 2025, due to elevated new construction completions. We believe that this new supply will also keep rent growth subdued in the fourth quarter of 2024, and 2024 rent growth at below-average levels, in the 1.0 to 1.5 range, especially as many renters are also dealing with higher levels of consumer debt. 
 During the last several quarters, higher interest rates and investor yield requirements have reduced multifamily property sales transactions and placed downward pressure on multifamily property valuations. According to data from the MSCI Real Assets Commercial Property Price Index, multifamily property values declined 19.5 from the peak in the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2024. We believe that, despite recent interest rate cuts, multifamily sales activity may be subdued in the near term due to elevated new supply completions, sluggish rent growth, and higher-than-average vacancy rates. Over the longer term, however, we expect sales and valuations will improve due to expected improvements in multifamily housing market fundamentals stemming from positive demographic trends and ongoing job growth.

 Multifamily New Business Volume 
 (Dollars in billions) 

(1) Reflects unpaid principal balance of multifamily Fannie Mae MBS issued, multifamily loans purchased, and credit enhancements provided on multifamily mortgage assets during the period. 
 (2) Reflects new units financed by first liens; excludes second liens on units for which we had financed the first lien, as well as manufactured housing rentals. Second liens and manufactured housing rentals are included in unpaid principal balance. 
 Multifamily business volumes declined in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, reflecting increased competition. For 2024, FHFA has capped our multifamily loan purchases at 70 billion. FHFA requires that a minimum of 50 of our 2024 multifamily loan purchases must be mission-driven, focused on specified affordable and underserved market segments. For 2024, FHFA has exempted from the volume cap loans financing workforce housing properties meeting specified criteria that preserve long-term affordability for the properties.

 Multifamily Guaranty Book of Business and Average Charged Guaranty Fee 
 The chart below displays the unpaid principal balance and average charged guaranty fee related to our multifamily guaranty book of business. 
 Multifamily Guaranty Book of Business and Charged Fee (1 
 (Dollars in billions) 
 
 (1) For information reported in this Multifamily Business section, our multifamily guaranty book of business is measured using the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS. By contrast, the multifamily guaranty book of business presented in the Composition of Fannie Mae Guaranty Book of Business table in the Guaranty Book of Business section is based on the unpaid principal balance of Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. These amounts differ primarily as a result of payments we receive on underlying loans that have not yet been paid to the MBS holders. 
 (2) Our multifamily guaranty book of business primarily consists of multifamily mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, multifamily mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio, and other credit enhancements that we provide on multifamily mortgage assets. It does not include non-Fannie Mae multifamily mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio for which we do not provide a guaranty. 
 Our multifamily guaranty book of business grew to 485.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, a 4.5 increase from September 30, 2023, driven by our acquisitions combined with low prepayment volumes due to the high interest rate environment. 
 Our average charged guaranty fee represents the return we earn as compensation for the credit risk we assume on our multifamily guaranty book of business. The average charged guaranty fee on our multifamily guaranty book of business decreased as of September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023 due to lower average charged fees on our acquisitions for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 as compared with the existing loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business. Our guaranty fee i s impacted by the rate at which loans in our book of business turn over as well as the guaranty fees we charge on new business volumes, which are set at the time we acquire the loans. Our multifamily guaranty fee pricing is based on the individual credit risk characteristics of the loans we acquire and the overall composition of our multifamily guaranty book of business. Our multifamily guaranty fee pricing is also influenced by external forces, such as the availability and cost of other sources of liquidity, our mission-related goals, the FHFA volume cap, interest rates, and MBS spreads.

 (4) Includes investment gains or losses, expenses associated with legal claims, foreclosed property income (expense), gains or losses from partnership investments, debt extinguishment gains or losses, and other income or expenses. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income was relatively flat in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared with the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Higher guaranty fee income as a result of an increase in the size of our multifamily guaranty book of business was offset by lower average charged guaranty fees and lower yield maintenance income from fewer prepayments. 
 Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses 
 See Consolidated Results of Operations Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses for a discussion of our multifamily provision for credit losses. 
 Change in Expected Credit Enhancement Recoveries 
 Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by a provision for credit losses. As a result of our risk-sharing arrangements, the increase in our multifamily provision for credit losses increased our multifamily credit enhancement receivable. 
 Other Expenses, Net 
 Other expenses, net decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared with the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized litigation expense attributable to a jury verdict and an award of prejudgment interest for Fannie Mae preferred shareholders, of which 54 million was allocated to the Multifamily business segment.

 This section supplements and updates our discussion of multifamily mortgage credit risk management in our 2023 Form 10-K in MD A Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management. For additional information on the primary components of our strategy for managing multifamily credit risk, the factors that influence the credit risk profile of our multifamily guaranty book of business, our multifamily acquisition policy and underwriting standards, our 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 40 

MD A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management 

 multifamily guaranty book diversification and monitoring, and our front-end credit risk sharing, see MD A Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We typically obtain our multifamily credit information from the lenders or servicers of the mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business and receive representations and warranties from them as to the accuracy of the information. While we perform various quality assurance checks by sampling loans to assess compliance with our underwriting and eligibility criteria, we do not independently verify most reported information, and we rely on lender representations and warranties regarding the accuracy of the characteristics of loans in our guaranty book of business. 
 
 Multifamily Guaranty Book Diversification and Monitoring 
 As part of our ongoing credit risk management process, we and our lenders monitor the performance and risk characteristics of our multifamily loans and the underlying properties on an ongoing basis throughout the loan term at the asset and portfolio level. We generally require lenders to provide quarterly and/or annual financial updates for multifamily loans. We closely monitor loans that are higher risk, including loans with an estimated current debt service coverage ratio DSCR below 1.0, as that is an indicator of heightened default risk. 
 The physical condition of the properties that serve as collateral for our multifamily loans is an important credit risk characteristic. Accordingly, we also monitor property condition, through physical site inspections at loan origination, ongoing review of servicer-submitted property inspection reports through the life of the loan, and additional third-party inspection requirements for some higher risk transactions. Some borrowers may not invest in needed property repairs and maintenance, or in capital replacements, particularly in times of economic stress when they may not have sufficient resources. When concerns about property condition of underlying collateral arise, we have a dedicated team that actively engages with our lenders and borrowers to seek remediation of the identified issues. Failure to perform repairs may result in a default under the loan documents. 
 We have discovered instances of multifamily lending transactions in which one or more of the parties involved engaged in mortgage fraud or possible mortgage fraud, and we continue to investigate additional multifamily lending transactions in which we suspect fraud may have occurred. As described in Risk Factors in this report, certain gaps have been identified in our processes for managing multifamily loan origination fraud risk and for overseeing our multifamily seller/servicer counterparties. As a result, we have implemented changes to reinforce and clarify our requirements for multifamily sellers and servicers. We also continue to work to improve our processes to further reduce the risk we face from fraudulent practices, including implementing updates to our DUS Guide and expanding resources dedicated to overseeing multifamily sellers and servicers. In addition, we continue to pursue contractual remedies against multifamily lenders where we find breaches of the selling representations that lenders are required to provide on loans they sell to us, as well as against multifamily borrowers and sponsors. 
 We manage our exposure to interest-rate risk and monitor changes in interest rates, which can impact multiple aspects of our multifamily loans. Although interest rates have declined in the third quarter of 2024, interest rates in the first nine months of 2024 remained higher than the average for the prior ten-year period, during which period we acquired more than 80 of our multifamily guaranty book of business. High interest rates may reduce the ability of multifamily borrowers to refinance their loans, which often have balloon balances at maturity. We provide information on the maturity schedule of our multifamily loans in MD A Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management Multifamily Maturity Information in our 2023 Form 10-K and in quarterly financial supplements, which we furnish to the SEC with current reports on Form 8-K and make available on our website. 
 Additionally, in a high interest-rate environment, multifamily borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages will have higher monthly payments, which may lower their DSCRs. We generally require multifamily borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages to purchase and maintain interest rate caps for the life of the loan to protect against large movements in rates as well as maintain escrows at our servicers to reserve for the cost of replacing these caps. Purchasing or replacing required interest rate caps, especially those with longer terms and/or lower capped interest rates, becomes more expensive as interest rates rise. These costs, which have been elevated since mid-2022, combined with the higher monthly payments, have added pressure to borrowers ability to make payments and contributed to our elevated multifamily serious delinquency rate and criticized loan population. In the recent high interest rate environment, most multifamily borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages have been receiving payments from their interest rate cap providers, which helps to defray the higher cost of debt service and escrow payments. We actively monitor these interest-rate related risks as part of our risk management process. For more information on our criticized loan population, see Multifamily Problem Loan Management Credit Performance Statistics on Multifamily Problem Loans in this report. 
 We also monitor for risks manifesting within specific property types. A property type we continue to monitor closely is seniors housing, which in Fannie Mae s book of business is primarily comprised of independent living and assisted living facilities, some of which may have a limited capacity devoted to memory care. Although seniors housing loans 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 41 

MD A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management 

 constituted only 3 of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of September 30, 2024, based on unpaid principal balance, they constituted approximately one-third of our seriously delinquent multifamily loan population, as described below in Multifamily Problem Loan Management. Approximately 29 of our seniors housing loans were adjustable-rate mortgages as of September 30, 2024. We continue to monitor seniors housing loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business closely and actively manage loans that may be at risk of further deterioration or default. 
 The following table displays our multifamily business volumes and our multifamily guaranty book of business, based on certain key risk characteristics that we use to evaluate the risk profile and credit quality of our multifamily loans. For information on our multifamily acquisition policy and underwriting standards, see MD A Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management Multifamily Acquisition Policy and Underwriting Standards in our 2023 Form 10-K.

West consists of AK, CA, GU, HI, ID, MT, NV, OR, WA and WY. 
 
 Multifamily Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk 
 Front-End Credit Risk Sharing 
 We primarily transfer credit risk on the multifamily loans we guarantee through our Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS program, which delegates to DUS lenders the ability to underwrite and service multifamily loans, in accordance with our standards and requirements. See MD A Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K for a description of our DUS program. 
 Loans serviced by DUS lenders and their affiliates represented substantially all of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our DUS model typically results in our lenders assuming approximately one-third of the credit risk on our multifamily loans, either on a pro-rated or tiered basis. In certain situations, lenders assume less than one-third of the credit risk. We establish lender-specific loss-sharing limits for individual transactions based on loan size, lender financial performance, and lender creditworthiness, among other factors. When loss sharing is reduced on a loan, the servicing fee paid to the lender is reduced and our guaranty fee is increased to reflect the lower credit risk retained by the lender. 
 Non-DUS lenders, which represent a small portion of our multifamily guaranty book of business, typically share or absorb losses based on a negotiated percentage of the loan or the pool balance. 
 Back-End Credit Risk Sharing 
 Our back-end MCAS and MCIRT credit risk transfer programs transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a reference pool of multifamily mortgage loans to insurers, reinsurers, or investors. During the first nine months of 2024, we entered into three new multifamily credit risk transfer transactions, transferring multifamily mortgage credit risk through our MCIRT and MCAS programs. When engaging in credit risk transfer transactions, we consider their cost, the resulting capital relief, and the overall credit risk appetite of the market. The cost of our credit risk transfer transactions is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and housing market sentiment, as well as the demand and capacity of the investors and reinsurers that support these transactions. 
 The table below displays the total unpaid principal balance of multifamily loans and the percentage of our multifamily guaranty book of business, based on unpaid principal balance, that is covered by a back-end credit risk transfer transaction. The table does not reflect front-end lender risk-sharing arrangements, as only a small portion of our multifamily guaranty book of business is not covered by these arrangements.

 Multifamily Problem Loan Management 
 
 Credit Performance Statistics on Multifamily Problem Loans 
 The percentage of criticized loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business slightly decreased as of September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023, due to improving financial performance reflected in their latest operating statements and active management of the criticized loan population, both primarily related to seniors housing loans. However, our criticized loan population remains elevated, largely driven by properties financed with adjustable-rate mortgages. The criticized loans category substantially consists of loans classified as Substandard and also includes loans classified as Special Mention or Doubtful. Substandard loans are loans that have a well-defined weakness that could impact their timely full repayment. While the majority of the substandard loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business are currently making timely payments, we continue to monitor the performance of our substandard loan population. For more information on our credit quality indicators, including our population of substandard loans, see Note 4, Mortgage Loans. 
 Our multifamily serious delinquency rate increased to 0.56 as of September 30, 2024, compared with 0.46 as of December 31, 2023, due to a portfolio of approximately 600 million of adjustable-rate conventional loans that became seriously delinquent in the third quarter of 2024. Approximately one-third of our seriously delinquent multifamily loan population as of September 30, 2024 was comprised of seniors housing loans. Our multifamily serious delinquency rate consists of multifamily loans that were 60 days or more past due based on unpaid principal balance, expressed as a percentage of our multifamily guaranty book of business. 
 Management monitors the multifamily serious delinquency rate as an indicator of potential future credit losses and loss mitigation activities. Serious delinquency rates are reflective of our performance in assessing and managing credit risk associated with multifamily loans in our guaranty book of business. Typically, higher serious delinquency rates result in a higher allowance for loan losses. The percentage of loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business that were 180 days or more delinquent was 0.34 as of September 30, 2024, compared with 0.29 as of December 31, 2023. 
 In addition to the credit performance information on our multifamily loans provided in this report, we provide additional information about the performance of our multifamily loans that back MBS and whole loan REMICs in the Data Collections section of our DUS Disclose tool, available at www.fanniemae.com/dusdisclose. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report. Information in Data Collections may differ from similar measures presented in our financial statements and other public disclosures for a variety of reasons, including as a result of variations in the loan population covered, timing differences in reporting and other factors. 
 
 Multifamily REO Management 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 128 multifamily REO properties with a carrying value of 690 million, compared with 61 properties with a carrying value of 378 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in foreclosure activity was primarily driven by properties included in a specific seniors housing portfolio that had write-offs during 2023. A majority of properties in this portfolio have completed the foreclosure or sale process as of September 30, 2024; however, we expect the foreclosure process to take longer for properties in the portfolio that are located in certain judicial foreclosure states with historically long foreclosure timelines. 
 
 Multifamily Credit Loss Performance Metrics 
 The amount of multifamily credit losses or gains we realize in a given period is driven by foreclosures, pre-foreclosure sales, post-foreclosure REO activity and other events that trigger write-offs and recoveries. Our multifamily credit loss performance metrics are not defined terms and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For the purposes of our multifamily credit loss performance metrics, credit losses or gains

 represent write-offs net of recoveries and foreclosed property income or expense. We believe our multifamily credit losses, and our multifamily credit losses net of freestanding loss-sharing arrangements, provide useful information about our multifamily credit performance because they display our multifamily credit losses in the context of our multifamily guaranty book of business, including changes to the benefit we expect to receive from loss-sharing arrangements. Management views multifamily credit losses, net of freestanding loss-sharing arrangements, as a key metric related to our multifamily business model and our strategy to share multifamily credit risk.

 (1) Represents write-offs when a loan is determined to be uncollectible prior to a liquidation event, which includes foreclosure, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or a short-sale (collectively a liquidation event ), as well as write-offs at liquidation. Write-offs associated with non-REO sales are net of loss sharing. 
 (2) Represents changes to the benefit we expect to receive only from write-offs as a result of certain freestanding loss-sharing arrangements, primarily multifamily DUS lender risk-sharing transactions. Changes to the expected benefits we will receive are recorded in Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 (3) Calculated based on the annualized amount of Credit gains (losses) and Credit gains (losses), net of freestanding loss-sharing arrangements, divided by the average multifamily guaranty book of business during the period. 
 (4) Rate is calculated as the initial write-off amount divided by the average defaulted unpaid principal balance. 
 (5) Based on write-offs associated with a liquidation event. The rate excludes any costs, gains or losses associated with REO after initial acquisition through final disposition. The rate also excludes write-offs when a loan is determined to be uncollectible prior to a liquidation event. Write-offs are net of lender loss-sharing agreements. 
 (6) Represents the number of loans that experienced write-offs associated with a liquidation event during the period. 
 Our multifamily credit losses in the first nine months of 2024 were largely driven by write-offs of adjustable-rate conventional loans that became seriously delinquent during the third quarter of 2024. Our multifamily credit losses in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily driven by write-offs on a seniors housing portfolio during the first quarter of 2023.

the prior consent of Treasury if it would result in our aggregate indebtedness exceeding our outstanding debt limit, currently set to 270 billion. The calculation of our indebtedness for purposes of complying with our debt limit reflects the unpaid principal balance and excludes debt basis adjustments and debt of consolidated trusts. 
 Outstanding Debt 
 Total outstanding debt of Fannie Mae includes short-term and long-term debt and excludes debt of consolidated trusts. Short-term debt of Fannie Mae consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and, therefore, does not include the current portion of long-term debt. Long-term debt of Fannie Mae consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year.

Corporate Liquidity Portfolio 
 The chart below displays information on the composition of our corporate liquidity portfolio. The balance and composition of our corporate liquidity portfolio fluctuates as a result of changes in our cash flows, liquidity in the fixed-income markets, and our liquidity risk management framework and practices. 
 
 U.S. Treasury securities Securities purchased under agreements to resell Cash and cash equivalents (1) 
 
 (1) Cash equivalents are composed of overnight reverse repurchase agreements and U.S. Treasuries, if any, that have a maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We enter into certain business arrangements to facilitate our statutory purpose of providing liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Some of these arrangements are not recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction, depending on the nature or structure of, and the accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements are commonly referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements and expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our off-balance sheet arrangements result primarily from the following: 
 our guaranty of mortgage loan securitization and resecuritization transactions over which we have no control, which are reflected in our unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS net of any beneficial ownership interest we retain, and other financial guarantees that we do not control; 
 liquidity support transactions; and 
 partnership interests. 
 The total amount of our off-balance sheet exposure related to unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS net of any beneficial interest that we retain, and other financial guarantees was 215.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 227.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. The majority of the other financial guarantees consists of Freddie Mac securities backing Fannie Mae structured securities. See Guaranty Book of Business and Note 7, Financial Guarantees for more information regarding our maximum exposure to loss on unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS and Freddie Mac securities. 
 Our total outstanding liquidity commitments to advance funds for securities backed by multifamily housing revenue bonds totaled 4.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 4.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. These commitments require us to advance funds to third parties that enable them to repurchase tendered bonds or securities that are unable to be remarketed. 
 We have investments in various limited partnerships and similar legal entities, which consist of LIHTC investments, community investments and investments in other entities. When we do not have a controlling financial interest in those entities, our condensed consolidated balance sheets reflect only our investment rather than the full amount of the partnership s assets and liabilities. See Note 3, Consolidations and Transfers of Financial Assets Unconsolidated VIEs for information regarding our investments in limited partnerships and similar legal entities.

 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 . Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents increased from 68.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 76.8 billion as of September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by cash inflows from (1) proceeds from repayments of loans, (2) the sale of Fannie Mae MBS to third parties, and (3) investments in securities purchased under agreements to resell. 
 Partially offsetting these cash inflows were cash outflows from (1) payments on outstanding debt of consolidated trusts, (2) purchases of loans held for investment, and (3) advances to lenders. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 . Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents decreased from 87.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 to 81.8 billion as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by cash outflows from (1) payments on outstanding debt of consolidated trusts, (2) purchases of loans held for investment, and (3) advances to lenders. 
 Partially offsetting these cash outflows were cash inflows from (1) proceeds from repayments of loans and (2) the sale of Fannie Mae MBS to third parties.

 Capital Management 
 Capital Requirements 
 FHFA published a final rule in November 2023 amending several provisions of the enterprise regulatory capital framework, with most of the amendments becoming effective in April 2024. For a description of our capital requirements under the enterprise regulatory capital framework, including the amended provisions, see Business Legislation and Regulation Capital Requirements in our 2023 Form 10-K. Although the enterprise regulatory capital framework went into effect in February 2021, we are not required to hold capital according to the framework s requirements until the date of termination of our conservatorship, or such later date as may be ordered by FHFA. 
 The table below sets forth information about our capital requirements under the standardized approach of the enterprise regulatory capital framework. Available capital under the enterprise regulatory capital framework excludes the stated value of the senior preferred stock of 120.8 billion and other specified amounts. As a result of these exclusions, we had a deficit in available capital as of September 30, 2024, despite having a positive net worth under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 
 We had a 228 billion shortfall of our available capital deficit of 41 billion to the adjusted total capital requirement (including buffers) of 187 billion under the standardized approach of the enterprise regulatory capital framework as of September 30, 2024. This capital shortfall (including buffers) declined by 15 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the increase in our retained earnings during the first nine months of 2024 and the impact of the amendments to the enterprise regulatory capital framework that became effective in April 2024. We had a 147 billion shortfall of our available capital deficit of 41 billion to the minimum adjusted total capital requirement (excluding buffers) of 106 billion as of September 30, 2024. This capital shortfall (excluding buffers) declined by 17 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024.

 Capital Activity 
 Under the terms governing the senior preferred stock, no dividends were payable to Treasury for the third quarter of 2024 and none are payable for the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Under the terms governing the senior preferred stock, through and including the capital reserve end date, any increase in our net worth during a fiscal quarter results in an increase of the same amount in the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock in the following quarter. The capital reserve end date is defined as the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter during which we have had and maintained capital equal to, or in excess of, all of the capital requirements and buffers under the enterprise regulatory capital framework. 
 As a result of these terms governing the senior preferred stock, the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock increased to 208.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 203.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, due to the 4.5 billion increase in our net worth in the second quarter of 2024. The aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock will further increase to 212.0 billion as of December 31, 2024, due to the 4.0 billion increase in our net worth in the third quarter of 2024. See Business Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements Treasury Agreements in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on the terms of our senior preferred stock, including how the aggregate liquidation preference is determined. 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 54 

MD A | Liquidity and Capital Management 

 Increases in our net worth improve our capital position and our ability to absorb losses; however, increases in our net worth also increase the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock by the same amount until the capital reserve end date as discussed above. 
 
 Treasury Funding Commitment 
 Treasury made a commitment under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement to provide funding to us under certain circumstances if we have a net worth deficit. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount of Treasury s funding commitment to us was 113.9 billion. See Note 2, Conservatorship, Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and Related Matters in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on Treasury s funding commitment under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. 
 
 Risk Management 
 
 Our business activities expose us to the following major categories of risk: credit risk (including mortgage credit risk and institutional counterparty credit risk), market risk (including interest-rate risk), liquidity and funding risk, operational risk (including cyber/information security risk and third-party risk) and model risk, as well as strategic risk, compliance risk and reputational risk. We are also exposed to climate risk, which we view as a cross-cutting risk that can impact a variety of our existing risk categories, particularly credit risk. See MD A Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of our management of these risks. This section supplements and updates that discussion but does not address all of the risk management categories described in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management 
 Mortgage Insurers 
 In August 2024, FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are issuing updates to the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements PMIERs ), which are the financial and operational standards that private mortgage insurance companies must meet to provide insurance on the mortgage loans that we and Freddie Mac acquire. The updated standards primarily are designed to address the risk management associated with the quality of a mortgage insurer s investment portfolio and the potential for that portfolio to lose value. FHFA stated that the updated standards will improve Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac s counterparty risk management and better prepare them to withstand a future stress situation while fulfilling their mission to serve as a reliable source of liquidity for equitable and sustainable housing finance throughout the economic cycle. The updated standards will be implemented through a 24-month phased-in approach, with a fully effective date of September 30, 2026. 
 
 Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management 
 We are subject to market risk, which includes interest-rate risk and spread risk. These risks arise primarily from our mortgage asset investments. Interest-rate risk is the risk that movements in interest rates will adversely affect the value of our assets or liabilities or our future earnings or capital. Spread risk is the risk from changes in an instrument s value that relate to factors other than changes in interest rates. We do not currently actively manage or hedge, on an economic basis, our spread risk, or the interest-rate risk arising from cost basis adjustments and float income associated with mortgage assets held by our consolidated MBS trusts. See MD A Risk Management Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management and Risk Factors Market and Industry Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information, including our sources of interest-rate risk exposure, business risks posed by changes in interest rates, and our strategy for managing interest-rate risk.

 Measurement of Interest-Rate Risk 
 The table below displays the pre-tax market value sensitivity of our net portfolio to changes in the level of interest rates and the slope of the applicable yield curve as measured on the last day of each period presented. We collectively define our net portfolio as: our retained mortgage portfolio assets; our corporate liquidity portfolio; outstanding debt of Fannie Mae used to fund the retained mortgage portfolio assets and corporate liquidity portfolio; mortgage commitments; and risk management derivatives. The table below also provides the daily average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation values for duration gap and for the most adverse market value impact on the net portfolio to changes in the level of interest rates and the slope of the applicable yield curve for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our practice is to allow interest rates to go below zero in the downward shock models unless otherwise prevented through contractual floors. 
 For information on how we measure our interest-rate risk, see MD A Risk Management Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 (1) Computed based on changes in SOFR interest-rates swap curve. Changes in the level of interest rates assume a parallel shift in all maturities of the SOFR interest-rate swap curve. Changes in the slope of the yield curve assume a constant 7-year rate, a shift of 16.7 basis points for the 1-year rate (and shorter tenors) and an opposite shift of 8.3 basis points for the 30-year rate. Rate shocks for remaining maturity points are interpolated. 
 (2) Measured on the last business day of each period presented. 
 (3) Computed based on daily values during the period presented. 
 The market value sensitivity of our net portfolio varies across a range of interest-rate shocks depending upon the duration and convexity profile of our net portfolio. The market value sensitivity of the net portfolio is measured by quantifying the change in the present value of the cash flows of our financial assets and liabilities that would result from an instantaneous shock to interest rates, assuming spreads are held constant.

 We use derivatives to help manage the residual interest-rate risk exposure between the assets and liabilities in our net portfolio. Derivatives have enabled us to keep our economic interest-rate risk exposure at consistently low levels in a wide range of interest-rate environments. The table below displays an example of how derivatives impacted the net market value exposure for a 50 basis point parallel interest-rate shock. For additional information on our derivative positions, see Note 9, Derivative Instruments in our 2023 Form 10-K and in this report.

 Earnings Exposure to Interest-Rate Risk 
 While we manage the interest-rate risk of our net portfolio with the objective of remaining neutral to movements in interest rates and volatility on an economic basis, our earnings can experience volatility due to interest-rate changes and differing accounting treatments that apply to certain financial instruments on our balance sheet. Specifically, we have exposure to earnings volatility that is driven by changes in interest rates in two primary areas: our net portfolio and our consolidated MBS trusts. The exposure in the net portfolio is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of risk management derivatives, mortgage commitments, and certain assets, primarily securities, that are carried at fair value. The exposure related to our consolidated MBS trusts relates to changes in our credit loss reserves and to the amortization of cost basis adjustments resulting from changes in interest rates. 
 We apply fair value hedge accounting to address some of the exposure to interest rates, particularly the earnings volatility related to changes in benchmark interest rates. Our hedge accounting program is specifically designed to address the volatility of our financial results associated with changes in fair value related to changes in these benchmark interest rates. As such, earnings variability driven by other factors, such as spreads or changes in cost basis amortization recognized in net interest income, remains. In addition, our ability to effectively reduce earnings volatility is dependent upon the volume and type of interest-rate swaps available for hedging, which is driven by our interest-rate risk management strategy discussed above and in our 2023 Form 10-K. As our range of available interest-rate swaps varies over time, our ability to reduce earnings volatility through hedge accounting may vary as well. When the shape of the yield curve shifts significantly from period to period, hedge accounting may be less effective. In our current program, we establish new hedging relationships each business day to provide flexibility in our overall risk management strategy. 
 See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 9, Derivative Instruments in this report for additional information on our fair value hedge accounting policy and related disclosures. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this report and in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. Management has discussed any significant changes in judgments and assumptions in applying our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. See Risk Factors General Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with the need for management to make judgments and estimates in applying our accounting policies and methods. We have identified one of our accounting estimates, allowance for loan losses, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 57 

MD A | Critical Accounting Estimates 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of single-family and multifamily HFI loan receivables that we expect will not be collected related to loans held by Fannie Mae or by consolidated Fannie Mae MBS trusts. The expected credit losses are deducted from the amortized cost basis of HFI loans to present the net amount expected to be received. 
 The allowance for loan losses involves substantial judgment on a number of matters including the development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, the reversion period applied, the assessment of similar risk characteristics, which determines the historic loss experience used to derive probability of loan default, the valuation of collateral, which includes judgments about the property condition at the time of foreclosure, and the determination of a loan s remaining expected life. Our most significant judgments involved in estimating our allowance for loan losses relate to the modeled macroeconomic data used to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts for key economic drivers, which are subject to significant inherent uncertainty. Most notably, for single-family, the model uses forecasted single-family home prices as well as a range of possible future interest rate environments. For multifamily, the model uses forecasted rental income and property valuations over the remaining life of each mortgage loan. In developing a reasonable and supportable forecast, the model simulates multiple paths of interest rates, rental income and property values based on current market conditions. 
 Quantitative Component 
 We use a discounted cash flow method to measure expected credit losses on our single-family mortgage loans and an undiscounted loss method to measure expected credit losses on our multifamily mortgage loans. 
 Our modeled loan performance is based on our historical experience of loans with similar risk characteristics adjusted to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our historical loss experience and our loan loss estimates capture the possibility of a multitude of events, including remote events that could result in credit losses on loans that are considered low risk. Our credit loss models, including the macroeconomic forecast data used as key inputs, are subject to our model oversight and review processes as well as other established governance and controls. 
 Qualitative Component 
 Our process for measuring expected credit losses is complex and involves significant management judgment, including a reliance on historical loss information and current economic forecasts that may not be representative of credit losses we ultimately realize. Management adjustments may be necessary to take into consideration external factors and current macroeconomic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the data used to derive the model outputs. Qualitative factors and events not previously observed by the models through historical loss experience may also be considered, as well as the uncertainty of their impact on credit loss estimates. Qualitative factors considered in the third quarter of 2024 evaluation of multifamily credit losses included uncertainty relating to multifamily property values and the ongoing investigation of multifamily lending transactions involving suspected fraud. For single-family, qualitative factors considered included the potential impact of Hurricane Helene. See Consolidated Results of Operations Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses for additional information about these factors. 
 Macroeconomic Variables and Sensitivities 
 Our benefit or provision for credit losses can vary substantially from period to period based on forecasted macroeconomic drivers; primarily home prices and interest rates related to our single-family book of business, which for the purposes of macroeconomic model inputs, we have determined are the most significant judgments used in our estimation of credit losses. We develop regional forecasts for single-family home prices using a multi-path simulation that captures home price projections over a five-year period, which is the period for which we can develop reasonable and supportable forecasts. After the five-year period, the home price forecast reverts to a historical long-term growth rate. Additionally, our model projects the range of possible interest rate scenarios over the life of the loan. This process captures multiple possible outcomes of what could be more or less favorable economic environments for the borrower, and therefore will increase or decrease the likelihood of default or prepayment depending on the environment in each path of the simulation.

The table below provides information about our most significant key macroeconomic inputs used in determining our single-family allowance for loan losses: forecasted home price growth rates and interest rates. Although the model consumes a wide range of possible regional home price forecasts and interest rate scenarios that take into account inherent uncertainty, the forecasts below represent the mean path of those simulations used in determining the allowance for each quarter through the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and for each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2023, and how those forecasts have changed between periods of estimate. Below we present our home price growth and interest rate estimates used in our estimate of expected credit losses. Our forecasts include estimates for periods beyond 2026 that are not presented in the table below.

 (1) These forecasts are provided here solely for the purpose of providing insight into our credit loss model. Forecasts for future periods are subject to significant uncertainty, which increases for periods that are further in the future. We provide our most recent forecasts for certain macroeconomic and housing market conditions in Key Market Economic Indicators. In addition, each month our Economic Strategic Research group provides its forecast of economic and housing market conditions, which are available in the About Us/Research and Insights section of our website, www.fanniemae.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report. 
 (2) These estimates are based on our national home price index, which is calculated differently from the S P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index and therefore results in different percentages for comparable growth. We periodically update our home price growth estimates and forecasts as new data become available. As a result, the forecast data in this table may also differ from the forecasted home price growth rate presented in Key Market Economic Indicators, because that section reflects our most recent forecast as of the filing date of this report, while this table reflects the quantitative forecast data we used in our model to estimate credit losses for the periods shown. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic updates to our inputs in our credit loss model from the time they are 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q

MD A | Critical Accounting Estimates 

approved as part of our established governance process to ensure the reasonableness of the inputs used to calculate estimated credit losses. The forecast data excludes the impact of any qualitative adjustments. 
 (3) Forecasted 30-year interest rates represent the mean of possible future interest rate environments that are simulated by our interest rate model and used in the estimation of credit losses. Forecasts through the end of December 31, 2024 and 2023 represent the average forecasted rate from the quarter-end through the calendar year end of December 31st. The fourth quarter of 2023 interest rate represents the 30-year interest rate as of December 31, 2023. This table reflects the forecasted interest rate data we used in estimating credit losses for the periods shown and does not reflect changes in interest rates that occurred after the forecast date. 
 It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall credit loss estimates, because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for loan losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or loan types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. Changes in our assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect our estimate of expected credit losses and lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. 
 As noted above, our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in home prices and interest rate changes. To consider the impact of a hypothetical change in home prices, assuming a positive one-percentage point change in the home price growth rate for the first twelve months of the forecast, on a normalized basis, with all other factors held constant, the single-family allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2024 would decrease by approximately 3 . Conversely, assuming a negative one-percentage point change in the home price growth rate for the first twelve months of the forecast, on a normalized basis, the single-family allowance for loan losses would increase by approximately 3 . 
 To consider the impact of a hypothetical change in 30-year interest rates, assuming a 50-basis point increase in estimated 30-year interest rates, with all other factors held constant, the single-family allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2024 would increase by approximately 4 . Conversely, assuming a 50-basis point decrease in 30-year interest rates, the single-family allowance for loan losses would decrease by approximately 5 . 
 These sensitivity analyses are hypothetical and are provided solely for the purpose of providing insight into our credit loss model inputs. In addition, sensitivities for home price and interest rate changes are non-linear. As a result, changes in these estimates are not incrementally proportional. The purpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact of home price appreciation and 30-year interest rates on the estimate of the allowance for credit losses. For example, it is not intended to imply management s expectation of future changes in our forecasts or any other variables that may change as a result. 
 We provide more detailed information on our accounting for the allowance for loan losses in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 5, Allowance for Loan Losses for additional information about our current period benefit for loan losses. 
 See Key Market Economic Indicators in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information about how home prices can affect our credit loss estimates. See Key Market Economic Indicators in this report for a discussion of home price growth rates and our home price forecast. Also see Consolidated Results of Operations Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses in this report for information on how our home price forecast impacted our single-family benefit for credit losses.

Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement 
 FHFA, as conservator, entered into a senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury on our behalf in September 2008. In connection with that agreement, we issued Treasury shares of Variable Liquidation Preference Senior Preferred Stock, Series 2008-2, which we refer to as the senior preferred stock, and a warrant to purchase shares equal to of our common stock, on a fully diluted basis, for a nominal price. This agreement also provides funding to us under certain circumstances if we have a net worth deficit. Pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, we have received a total of billion from Treasury as of September 30, 2024, and the amount of remaining funding available to us under the agreement is billion. We have not received any funding from Treasury under this commitment since the first quarter of 2018. We had a positive net worth of billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 The dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock permit us to retain increases in our net worth until our net worth exceeds the amount of adjusted total capital necessary for us to meet the capital requirements and buffers under the enterprise regulatory capital framework established by FHFA. As a result of our conservatorship status and the terms of the senior preferred stock, no amounts would be available to distribute as dividends to common or preferred stockholders (other than to Treasury as the holder of the senior preferred stock). 
 The aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock increased to billion as of September 30, 2024 from billion as of June 30, 2024, due to the billion increase in our net worth in the second quarter of 2024. The aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock will further increase to billion as of December 31, 2024, due to the billion increase in our net worth in the third quarter of 2024.

of the total number of shares of Fannie Mae common stock, we and Treasury are deemed related parties. As of September 30, 2024, Treasury held an investment in our senior preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of billion. 
 FHFA s control of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has caused Fannie Mae, FHFA and Freddie Mac to be deemed related parties. Additionally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac jointly own Common Securitization Solutions, LLC CSS ), a limited liability company created to operate a common securitization platform; as a result, CSS is deemed a related party. CSS operates as a separate company from us and Freddie Mac, with all funding and limited administrative support services and other resources provided to it by us and Freddie Mac. 
 In the ordinary course of business, Fannie Mae may purchase and sell securities issued by Treasury and Freddie Mac in the capital markets. Some of the structured securities we issue are backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each have agreed to indemnify the other party for losses caused by: its failure to meet its payment or other specified obligations under the trust agreements pursuant to which the underlying resecuritized securities were issued; its failure to meet its obligations under the customer services agreement; its violations of laws; or with respect to material misstatements or omissions in offering documents, ongoing disclosures and materials relating to the underlying resecuritized securities. We also make regular income tax payments to and receive tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service IRS ), a bureau of Treasury. 
 We contributed million and million to CSS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We contributed million and million to CSS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Our maximum exposure to loss generally represents the greater of our carrying amount related to our involvement with unconsolidated securitization and resecuritization trusts or the unpaid principal balance of the assets covered by our guaranty. Our involvement in unconsolidated resecuritization trusts may give rise to additional exposure to loss depending on the type of resecuritization trust. Fannie Mae resecuritization trusts that are backed entirely by Fannie Mae MBS are not consolidated and do not give rise to any additional exposure to loss as we already consolidate the underlying collateral. In contrast, Fannie Mae resecuritization trusts that are backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities may increase our exposure to loss to the extent that we are providing a guaranty for the timely payment and interest on the underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have not previously guaranteed. Our maximum exposure to loss for these unconsolidated trusts is measured by the amount of Freddie Mac securities that are held in these resecuritization trusts. 
 Our maximum exposure to loss related to unconsolidated securitization and resecuritization trusts, which includes but is not limited to our exposure to these Freddie Mac securities, was approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The total assets of our unconsolidated securitization and resecuritization trusts were approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The maximum exposure to loss for our unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar legal entities, which consist of low income housing tax credit LIHTC investments, community investments and investments in other entities, was million and the related net carrying value was million as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum exposure to loss was million and the related net carrying value was million. The total assets of these limited partnership investments were billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The maximum exposure to loss related to our involvement with unconsolidated SPVs that transfer credit risk represents the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest payable of obligations issued by our Connecticut Avenue Securities CAS and Multifamily Connecticut Avenue Securities MCAS TM SPVs.

 Our single-family benefit for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a benefit from forecasted home price growth and a benefit from actual and projected interest rates, partially offset by a provision from changes in loan activity, as described below. 
 Benefit from forecasted home price growth. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our forecast of future home prices improved. Higher home prices decrease the likelihood that loans will default and reduce the amount of losses on loans that do default, which impacts our estimate of losses and ultimately reduces our loss reserves and provision for loan losses.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Allowance for Loan Losses 

 billion with an associated write-off against the allowance for loan losses of million. Interest rates on the redesignated loans were below current market interest rates, and as a result, we recorded additional provision for loan losses to the extent that the carrying value of the loans exceeded their fair value at the time of redesignation. 
 Provision from changes in loan activity. This includes provision on newly acquired loans and was primarily driven by an increase of the portion of our single-family acquisitions consisting of purchase loans in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our multifamily provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was largely driven by certain adjustable-rate conventional loans that were written down to the net recoverable amount during the period. We also recognized provision for loan losses because, compared to our previous forecast, our current period forecast expects further slight decreases in projected multifamily property values and a longer period of time for projected multifamily property values to improve. 
 Our multifamily allowance and estimate for loan losses as of September 30, 2024 also considers uncertainty. This includes uncertainty relating to multifamily property values, as well as uncertainty due to the ongoing investigation of multifamily lending transactions with suspected fraud, which may increase the risk of default. 
 Our multifamily provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by loan delinquencies in our multifamily guaranty book of business, including provision attributable to adjustable-rate conventional loans that became seriously delinquent and were written down to the net recoverable amount, declines in estimated actual and projected multifamily property values, and provision for uncertainty described above. 
 The largest driver of our multifamily provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was a provision for actual and projected interest rates. Rising interest rates increase the likelihood that loans with balloon balances due at maturity will be unable to refinance, due to higher refinancing rates. In addition, rising interest rates increase costs for loans with adjustable-rates, which increases the expected impairment and the provision for loan losses on these loans. 
 The impact of this factor was offset by a benefit from actual and projected economic data for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The benefit from actual and projected economic data was primarily driven by the impact of a change in our long-term economic forecast assumptions, which was partially offset by continued declines in multifamily property values.

We believe that the guaranty provided by the issuing agency, the support provided to the agencies by the U.S. government, the importance of the agencies to the liquidity and stability in the secondary mortgage market, and the long history of zero credit losses on agency mortgage-related securities are all indicators that there are currently no credit losses on these securities, even if the security is in an unrealized loss position. In addition, we generally hold these securities that are in an unrealized loss position to recovery. As a result, unless we intend to sell the security, we do not recognize an allowance for credit losses on agency mortgage-related securities. ) ) ) 
 There were no sales of AFS securities in the first nine months of 2024 or the first nine months of 2023. As a result, gross realized gains (losses) or proceeds from sales were recognized in either period.

 The maximum remaining contractual term of our guarantees is years; however, the actual term of each guaranty may be significantly less than the contractual term based on the prepayment characteristics of the related mortgage loans. 
 As the guarantor of structured securities backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac-issued securities, we extend our guaranty to the underlying Freddie Mac securities in our resecuritization trusts. However, Freddie Mac continues to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have resecuritized. When we began issuing UMBS, we entered into an indemnification agreement under which Freddie Mac agreed to indemnify us for losses caused by its failure to meet its payment or other specified obligations under the trust agreements pursuant to which the underlying resecuritized securities were issued. As a result, and due to the funding commitment available to Freddie Mac through its senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury, we have concluded that the associated credit risk is negligible. Accordingly, we exclude from the following table Freddie Mac securities backing unconsolidated Fannie Mae-issued structured securities of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Pool mortgage insurance Total mortgage insurance risk in force 
 Mortgage insurance only covers losses that are realized after the borrower defaults and title to the property is subsequently transferred, such as after a foreclosure, short-sale, or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Also, mortgage insurance does not protect us from all losses on covered loans. For example, mortgage insurance is not intended to cover property damage from hazards, including natural disasters; and the mortgage insurance policy permits the exclusion of any material loss directly related to property damage. 
 In general, we require single-family and multifamily borrowers to obtain and maintain property insurance to cover the risk of damage to their homes or properties resulting from hazards such as fire, wind and, for properties located in Federal Emergency Management Agency-designated Special Flood Hazard Areas, flooding. Since we generally require borrowers to select and obtain hazard insurance policies, our requirements for hazard insurance coverage are verified by the lender or servicer, as applicable. For single-family loans, we require a minimum financial strength rating for non-governmental hazard insurers that must be provided by S P Global, Demotech, AM Best or KBRA. For multifamily loans, we require a minimum financial strength rating for non-governmental hazard insurers that must be provided by Demotech or AM Best. We do not independently verify the financial condition of these hazard insurers and rely on these rating agencies for their assessment of the financial condition of these insurers.

 Represents less than of the risk in force mortgage insurance coverage. 
 (1) Insurance coverage amounts provided for each counterparty may include coverage provided by affiliates and subsidiaries of the counterparty. 
 We have counterparty credit risk relating to the potential insolvency of, or non-performance by, monoline mortgage insurers that insure single-family loans we purchase or guarantee. There is risk that these counterparties may fail to fulfill their obligations to pay our claims under insurance policies. On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our mortgage insurer counterparties respective abilities to fulfill their obligations to us. Our assessment includes financial reviews and analyses of the insurers portfolios and capital adequacy. If we determine that it is probable that we will not collect all of our claims from one or more of our mortgage insurer counterparties, it could increase our loss reserves, which could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and net worth. 
 When we estimate the credit losses that are inherent in our mortgage loans and under the terms of our guaranty obligations, we also consider the recoveries that we expect to receive from primary mortgage insurance, as mortgage insurance recoveries reduce the severity of the loss associated with defaulted loans if the borrower defaults and title to the property is subsequently transferred. Mortgage insurance does not cover credit losses that result from a reduction in mortgage interest paid by the borrower in connection with a loan modification, forbearance of principal, or forbearance of scheduled loan payments. We evaluate the financial condition of our mortgage insurer counterparties and adjust the contractually due recovery amounts to ensure that expected credit losses as of the balance sheet date are included in our loss reserve estimate. As a result, if our assessment of one or more of our mortgage insurer counterparties ability to fulfill their respective obligations to us worsens, it could increase our loss reserves. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our estimated benefit from mortgage insurance, which is based on estimated credit losses as of period end, reduced our loss reserves by million and billion, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding receivables of million and million, respectively, recorded in Other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets related to amounts claimed on insured, defaulted loans excluding government-insured loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we assessed these outstanding receivables for collectability, and established a valuation allowance of million and million, respectively. 
 Mortgage Servicers and Sellers. Mortgage servicers collect mortgage and escrow payments from borrowers, pay taxes and insurance costs from escrow accounts, monitor and report delinquencies, and perform other required activities, including loss mitigation, on our behalf. Our mortgage servicers and sellers may also be obligated to repurchase loans or foreclosed properties, reimburse us for losses or provide other remedies under certain circumstances, such as if it is determined that the mortgage loan did not meet our underwriting or eligibility requirements, if certain loan representations and warranties are violated or if mortgage insurers rescind coverage. Our representation and warranty framework does not require repurchase for loans that have breaches of certain selling representations and warranties if they have met specified criteria for relief.

 We are often unable to estimate the possible losses or ranges of losses, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development, where plaintiffs seek indeterminate or unspecified damages, where there may be novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings, or where settlement negotiations have not occurred or progressed. Given the uncertainties involved in any action or proceeding, regardless of whether we have established an accrual, the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our net income or loss for that period. 
 In addition to the matters specifically described below, we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business that we do not expect will have a material impact on our business or financial condition.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Information about market risk is set forth in MD A Risk Management Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Overview 
 We are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. As a result of management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, or as of the date of filing this report. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, or as of the date of filing this report because they did not adequately ensure the accumulation and communication to management of information known to FHFA that is needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws. As a result, we were not able to rely upon the disclosure controls and procedures that were in place as of September 30, 2024, or as of the date of this filing, and we continue to have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness is described in more detail below under Description of Material Weakness. Based on discussions with FHFA and the structural nature of this material weakness, we do not expect to remediate this material weakness while we are under conservatorship. 
 Description of Material Weakness 
 The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s Auditing Standard 2201 defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management has determined that we continued to have the following material weakness as of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of filing this report: 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We have been under the conservatorship of FHFA since September 2008. Under the GSE Act, FHFA is an independent agency that currently functions as both our conservator and our regulator with respect to our safety, soundness, and mission. Because of the nature of the conservatorship under the GSE Act, which places us under the control of FHFA (as that term is defined by securities laws), some of the information that we may need to meet our disclosure obligations may be solely within the knowledge of FHFA. As our conservator, FHFA has the power to take actions without our knowledge that could be material to our stockholders and other stakeholders, and could significantly affect our financial performance or our continued existence as an ongoing business. Although we and FHFA attempted to design and implement 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 119 

Controls and Procedures 

disclosure policies and procedures that would account for the conservatorship and accomplish the same objectives as a disclosure controls and procedures policy of a typical reporting company, there are inherent structural limitations on our ability to design, implement, operate, and test effective disclosure controls and procedures. As both our regulator and our conservator under the GSE Act, FHFA is limited in its ability to design and implement a complete set of disclosure controls and procedures relating to Fannie Mae, particularly with respect to current reporting pursuant to Form 8-K. Similarly, as a regulated entity, we are limited in our ability to design, implement, operate, and test the controls and procedures for which FHFA is responsible. 
 Due to these circumstances, we have not been able to update our disclosure controls and procedures in a manner that adequately ensures the accumulation and communication to management of information known to FHFA that is needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws, including disclosures affecting our condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result, we did not maintain effective controls and procedures designed to ensure complete and accurate disclosure as required by GAAP as of September 30, 2024, or as of the date of filing this report. Based on discussions with FHFA and the structural nature of this weakness, we do not expect to remediate this material weakness while we are under conservatorship. 
 Mitigating Actions Related to Material Weakness 
 We and FHFA have engaged in the following practices intended to permit accumulation and communication to management of information needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws: 
 FHFA has established the Division of Conservatorship Oversight and Readiness, which is intended to facilitate operation of the company with the oversight of the conservator. 
 We have provided drafts of our SEC filings to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to filing. We also have provided drafts of external press releases, statements, and speeches to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to release. 
 FHFA personnel, including senior officials, have reviewed our SEC filings prior to filing, including this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q ), and engaged in discussions regarding issues associated with the information contained in those filings. Prior to filing our Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q, FHFA provided Fannie Mae management with written acknowledgment that it had reviewed the Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q, and it was not aware of any material misstatements or omissions in the Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q and had no objection to our filing the Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. 
 Our senior management meets regularly with senior leadership at FHFA, including, but not limited to, the Director. 
 FHFA representatives attend meetings frequently with various groups within the company to enhance the flow of information and to provide oversight on a variety of matters, including accounting, credit and market risk management, external communications, and legal matters. 
 Senior officials within FHFA s Office of the Chief Accountant have met frequently with our senior finance executives regarding our accounting policies, practices, and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting from July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 that management believes have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes that we believe will improve these controls and increase efficiency, while continuing to ensure that we maintain effective internal controls. Changes may include implementing new, more efficient systems, automating manual processes, and updating existing systems.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The information in this item supplements and updates information regarding certain legal proceedings set forth in Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K, our First Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q and our Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. We also provide information regarding material legal proceedings in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition to the matters specifically described or incorporated by reference in this item, we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business that we do not expect will have a material impact on our business or financial condition. However, litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many factors and their outcome and effect on our business and financial condition generally cannot be predicted accurately. 
 We establish an accrual for legal claims only when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of such loss. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims. If certain of these matters are determined against us, FHFA or Treasury, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, including our net worth. 
 Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements Litigation 
 Since June 2013, preferred and common stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac filed lawsuits in multiple federal courts against one or more of the United States, Treasury and FHFA, challenging actions taken by the defendants relating to the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac senior preferred stock purchase agreements and the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Some of these lawsuits also contain claims against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The legal claims being advanced by one or more of these lawsuits include challenges to the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock that were implemented pursuant to August 2012 amendments to the agreements, the payment of dividends to Treasury under the net worth sweep dividend provisions, and FHFA s decision to require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draw funds from Treasury to pay dividends to Treasury prior to the August 2012 amendments. The plaintiffs seek various forms of equitable and injunctive relief as well as damages. The cases that remain pending after June 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 District of Columbia (In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Class Action Litigations and Fairholme Funds v. FHFA) . Fannie Mae is a defendant in two cases filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, including a consolidated class action. The cases were consolidated for trial, and on August 14, 2023, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs and awarded damages of 299.4 million to Fannie Mae preferred stockholders. On March 20, 2024, the court entered final judgment and set the amount of prejudgment interest owed by Fannie Mae at 199.7 million. On April 17, 2024, the defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, which has been fully briefed. The parties will have 30 days to appeal following the court s decision on the motion. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. 
 Western District of Michigan (Rop et al. v. FHFA et al.). On June 1, 2017, preferred and common stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against FHFA and Treasury in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. FHFA and Treasury moved to dismiss the case on September 8, 2017, and plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on October 6, 2017. On September 8, 2020, the court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted defendants motion to dismiss. On October 4, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the stockholders suffered compensable harm. On February 2, 2023, plaintiffs filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking review of the Sixth Circuit s decision, which the Supreme Court denied on June 12, 2023. On August 11, 2023, plaintiffs submitted a motion for leave to file an amended complaint in the district court. 
 Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Wazee Street Opportunities Fund IV L.P. et al. v. FHFA et al.) . On August 16, 2018, common stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against FHFA and Treasury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. FHFA and Treasury moved to dismiss the case on November 16, 2018, and plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on December 21, 2018. On July 1, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint. 
 U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Fisher et al. v. United States of America). On December 2, 2013, common stockholders of Fannie Mae filed a lawsuit against the United States that listed Fannie Mae as a nominal defendant. The plaintiffs alleged that the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock that were implemented pursuant to the August 2012 amendment constituted a taking of Fannie Mae s property without just compensation in violation of the U.S. Constitution. On February 15, 2023, the court issued an order for plaintiffs to show cause why their claims should not be dismissed, as claims similar to theirs brought by other Fannie Mae stockholders in other cases against the United 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 121 

Other Information 

States had been dismissed by the court. On September 1, 2023, the court dismissed the case with prejudice. On October 30, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the information in this report, you should carefully consider the risks relating to our business that we identify in Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. This section supplements and updates that discussion. Also refer to MD A Risk Management, MD A Single-Family Business and MD A Multifamily Business in our 2023 Form 10-K and in this report for more detailed descriptions of the primary risks to our business and how we seek to manage those risks. 
 The risks we face could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our past results or the results contemplated by any forward-looking statements we make. We believe the risks described in the sections of this report and our 2023 Form 10-K referenced above are the most significant we face; however, these are not the only risks we face. We face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial. 
 We have experienced financial losses due to mortgage fraud and could experience additional financial losses due to mortgage fraud. 
 We use a process of delegated underwriting in which lenders make specific representations and warranties about the characteristics of the mortgage loans we purchase and securitize. As a result, we do not independently verify most borrower information that is provided to us. This exposes us to the risk that one or more of the parties involved in a transaction (such as the borrower, borrower s attorney, sponsor, seller, broker, appraiser, property inspector, title agent, lender or servicer) will engage in fraud by misrepresenting facts about a mortgage loan. Similarly, we rely on delegated servicing of loans and use of a variety of external resources to assist in asset management functions, including managing our REO inventory. We have experienced financial losses resulting from mortgage fraud, including institutional fraud perpetrated by counterparties. In the future, we may experience additional financial losses as a result of mortgage fraud. 
 We have discovered instances of multifamily lending transactions in which one or more of the parties involved engaged in mortgage fraud or possible mortgage fraud, and we continue to investigate additional multifamily lending transactions in which we suspect fraud may have occurred. Certain gaps have been identified in our processes for managing multifamily loan origination fraud risk and for overseeing our multifamily seller/servicer counterparties. See MD A Multifamily Business Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management Multifamily Guaranty Book Diversification and Monitoring for a discussion of actions we are taking to improve our processes that are intended to reduce the risk we face from fraudulent practices. Until we complete our work to improve our processes for managing multifamily loan origination fraud risk and oversight of multifamily seller/servicer counterparties, we may face a higher risk that we will be unable to detect or prevent fraudulent multifamily lending transactions, which could negatively affect our financial results and condition. Moreover, even when we have completed these process improvements, our mortgage fraud risk mitigation measures will not eliminate our exposure to this risk and we may still experience additional financial losses as a result of mortgage fraud. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Common Stock 
 Our common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market and quoted on the OTCQB, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., under the ticker symbol FNMA. 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 Under the terms of our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury, we are prohibited from selling or issuing our equity interests without the prior written consent of Treasury except under limited circumstances, which are described in Business Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements Treasury Agreements Covenants in our 2023 Form 10-K. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any equity securities. 
 Information about Certain Securities Issuances by Fannie Mae 
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, public companies are required to disclose certain information when they incur a material direct financial obligation or become directly or contingently liable for a material obligation under an off-balance sheet arrangement. The disclosure must be made in a current report on Form 8-K under Item 2.03 or, if the obligation is 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 122 

Other Information 

incurred in connection with certain types of securities offerings, in prospectuses for that offering that are filed with the SEC. 
 Because the securities we issue are exempted securities under the Securities Act of 1933, we do not file registration statements or prospectuses with the SEC with respect to our securities offerings. To comply with the disclosure requirements of Form 8-K relating to the incurrence of material financial obligations, in accordance with a no-action letter we received from the SEC staff in 2004, we report our incurrence of these types of obligations in offering circulars or prospectuses (or supplements thereto) that we post on our website within the same time period that a prospectus for a non-exempt securities offering would be required to be filed with the SEC. To the extent we incur a material financial obligation that is not disclosed in this manner, we would file a Form 8-K if required to do so under applicable Form 8-K requirements. 
 The website address for disclosure about our debt securities is www.fanniemae.com/debtsearch. From this address, investors can access the offering circular and related supplements for debt securities offerings under Fannie Mae s universal debt facility, including pricing supplements for individual issuances of debt securities. 
 Disclosure about our obligations pursuant to the MBS we issue, some of which may be off-balance sheet obligations, can be found at www.fanniemae.com/mbsdisclosure. From this address, investors can access information and documents about our MBS, including prospectuses and related prospectus supplements. 
 We are providing our website address solely for your information. Information appearing on our website is not incorporated into this report. 
 Our Purchases of Equity Securities 
 We did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 Our payment of dividends is subject to the following restrictions: 
 Restrictions Relating to Conservatorship. Our conservator announced on September 7, 2008 that we would not pay any dividends on the common stock or on any series of preferred stock, other than the senior preferred stock. In addition, FHFA s regulations relating to conservatorship and receivership operations prohibit us from paying any dividends while in conservatorship unless authorized by the Director of FHFA. The Director of FHFA has directed us to make dividend payments on the senior preferred stock on a quarterly basis for every dividend period for which dividends were payable. 
 Restrictions Under Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and Senior Preferred Stock. The senior preferred stock purchase agreement prohibits us from declaring or paying any dividends on Fannie Mae equity securities (other than the senior preferred stock) without the prior written consent of Treasury. In addition, the provisions of the senior preferred stock provide for dividends each quarter through and including the capital reserve end date in the amount, if any, by which our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds an applicable capital reserve amount. The applicable capital reserve amount is the amount of adjusted total capital necessary for us to meet the capital requirements and buffers set forth in the enterprise regulatory capital framework. The capital reserve end date is defined as the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter during which we have had and maintained capital equal to, or in excess of, all of the capital requirements and buffers under the enterprise regulatory capital framework. After the capital reserve end date, the amount of quarterly dividends to Treasury will be equal to the lesser of any quarterly increase in our net worth and a 10 annual rate on the then-current liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock. As a result, our ability to retain earnings in excess of the capital requirements and buffers set forth in the enterprise regulatory capital framework will be limited. For more information on the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and senior preferred stock, see Business Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Additional Restrictions Relating to Preferred Stock. Payment of dividends on our common stock is also subject to the prior payment of dividends on our preferred stock and our senior preferred stock. Payment of dividends on all outstanding preferred stock, other than the senior preferred stock, is also subject to the prior payment of dividends on the senior preferred stock. 
 Statutory Restrictions. Under the GSE Act, we are not permitted to make a capital distribution (including the payment of dividends) if, after making the distribution, we would be undercapitalized. The Director of FHFA, however, may permit us to repurchase shares if the repurchase is made in connection with the issuance of additional shares or obligations in at least an equivalent amount and will reduce our financial obligations or otherwise improve our financial condition. The GSE Act also provides that: (1) if we are classified as undercapitalized, we may not make a capital distribution that would result in our reclassification as significantly or critically undercapitalized; and (2) if we are classified as significantly undercapitalized, we may not make a capital distribution that would result in our reclassification as critically 
 Fannie Mae Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 123 

Other Information 

undercapitalized and we may not make any other capital distribution without the approval of the Director of FHFA. Our capital classifications have been suspended during conservatorship. In addition, under the Charter Act, we must obtain the prior written approval of FHFA to make a capital distribution that would decrease our total capital to an amount less than the risk-based capital level or that would decrease our core capital to an amount less than the minimum capital level. 
 While not currently applicable, our payment of dividends will be subject to the following restrictions under the enterprise regulatory capital framework effective on the date of termination of our conservatorship: 
 Restrictions Under Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework. During a calendar quarter, we will not be permitted to pay dividends or make any other capital distributions (or create an obligation to make such distributions) that, in the aggregate, exceed the amount equal to our eligible retained income for the quarter multiplied by our maximum payout ratio. The maximum payout ratio for a given quarter is the lowest of the payout ratios determined by our capital conservation buffer and our leverage buffer. We will not be subject to this limitation on distributions if we have a capital conservation buffer that is greater than our prescribed capital conservation buffer amount and a leverage buffer that is greater than our prescribed leverage buffer amount. Notwithstanding the above-described limitations, FHFA may permit us to make a distribution upon our request, if FHFA determines that the distribution would not be contrary to the purposes of this section of the enterprise regulatory capital framework or to our safety and soundness. We will not be permitted to make any distributions during a quarter if our eligible retained income is negative and either (a) our capital conservation buffer is less than our stress capital buffer or (b) our leverage buffer is less than our prescribed leverage buffer amount.
