As of September 30, 2024, the Company has provided for its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed and costs incurred, including liabilities associated with employment taxes, and has accrued approximately million. The amount to be indemnified by FOX of approximately million was recorded as a receivable in Other current assets on the Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. It is not possible to estimate the liability or corresponding receivable for any additional claims that may be filed given the information that is currently available to the Company. If more claims are filed and additional information becomes available, the Company will update the liability provision and corresponding receivable for such matters. 
 The Company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims. It is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof could damage its reputation, impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of million on pre-tax income of million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. 
 Management assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. Based on management s assessment of available evidence, it has been determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets may not be realized and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets. 
 The Company s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company s tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company is currently undergoing audits with certain U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. However, the Company may need to accrue additional income tax expense and its liability may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as these tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.

 Revenues Revenues increased 78 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 The revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by higher revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment primarily due to higher Australian residential revenues at REA Group, at the Book Publishing segment primarily due to higher digital book sales and improved returns in the U.S., at the Dow Jones segment driven by higher professional information business revenues and at the Subscription Video Services segment primarily due to higher streaming revenues and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower residential subscription revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues at the News Media segment driven by the transfer of third-party printing revenue contracts to News UK s joint venture with DMG Media in fiscal 2024 and lower advertising and circulation and subscription revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of 35 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period. 
 Operating expenses Operating expenses decreased 10 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 The decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by lower expenses at the News Media segment driven by cost savings from the combination of News UK s printing operations with those of DMG Media and other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher expenses at the Subscription Video Services segment driven by costs related to the Hubbl product, higher sports programming rights costs due to contractual increases and higher production costs. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense increase of 15 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative increased 37 million, or 4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 The increase in Selling, general and administrative for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher costs at the Digital Real Estate Services segment driven by REA Group, including 12 million of costs related to the withdrawn offer to acquire Rightmove and higher employee costs. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Selling, general and administrative increase of 12 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased 18 million, or 11 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, driven by higher depreciation of capitalized software costs, primarily at the Subscription Video Services and Digital Real Estate Services segments. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense increase of 2 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 Impairment and restructuring charges During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no impairment charges. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of 21 million at the News Media segment related to the write-down of fixed assets associated with the combination of News UK s printing operations with those of DMG Media. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded restructuring charges of 24 million and 17 million, respectively. 
 See Note 3 Impairment and Restructuring Charges in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Equity losses of affiliates Equity losses of affiliates increased by 1 million, or 50 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. See Note 4 Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense, net Interest expense, net decreased by 5 million, or 22 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, driven by higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates on cash balances. See Note 5 Borrowings and Note 7 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Other, net Other, net increased by 58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. See Note 12 Additional Financial Information in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Income tax expense For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of 60 million on pre-tax income of 204 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of 37 million on pre-tax income of 95 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. 
 See Note 10 Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net income Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 144 million compared to net income of 58 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. The increase of 86 million, or 148 , was driven by the factors discussed above. 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 3 million, or 11 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 Segment Analysis 
 Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the Company s businesses. Segment EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). 
 Total Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company s operations and other factors that affect the Company s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods.

Revenues at REA Group increased 57 million, or 22 , to 318 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 261 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher Australian residential revenues driven by price increases, increased depth penetration and growth in national listings, the 7 million, or 3 , positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and higher revenues from REA India. Revenues at Move decreased 2 million, or 1 , to 140 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 142 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, driven by the continued impact of the macroeconomic environment on the U.S. housing market. The challenging market conditions resulted in lower lead volumes, which decreased 1 , and lower transaction volumes. These factors adversely impacted revenues from both the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge product, and the core lead generation product. The decline was partially offset by revenue growth in seller, new homes and rentals, including the partnership with Zillow, and higher advertising revenues. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Segment EBITDA at the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 18 million, or 15 , as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. The increase in Segment EBITDA was primarily driven by the higher contribution from REA Group, mainly due to the revenue drivers discussed above and the 3 million, or 3 , positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by 12 million of costs related to the withdrawn offer to acquire Rightmove and higher employee costs. The increase was partially offset by the lower contribution from Move.

 Revenues at the News Media segment decreased 27 million, or 5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. Other revenues decreased 13 million, or 19 , primarily driven by the transfer of third-party printing revenue contracts to News UK s joint venture with DMG Media in fiscal 2024. Advertising revenues decreased 10 million, or 5 , as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, due to lower print advertising revenues, primarily at News Corp Australia, and lower digital advertising revenues at News UK, mainly due to a decline in traffic at some mastheads due to algorithm changes at certain platforms, partially offset by the 5 million, or 2 , positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 4 million, or 1 , as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, driven by print volume declines, partially offset by cover price increases and the 6 million, or 3 , positive impact of foreign currency fluctuation. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of 12 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. 
 Segment EBITDA at the News Media segment increased by 2 million, or 14 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024.

Other revenues decreased 14 million, or 56 , primarily driven by the transfer of third-party printing revenue contracts to its joint venture with DMG Media in fiscal 2024. Advertising revenues decreased 9 million, or 15 , driven by lower digital advertising revenues mainly due to algorithm changes at certain platforms and lower print advertising revenues. Circulation and subscription revenues increased 2 million, or 1 , due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as cover price increases and higher content licensing revenues were more than offset by print volume declines. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of 6 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Current Financial Condition 
 The Company s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents were 1.8 billion. The Company also has available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. The Company currently expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, including repayment of indebtedness. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for at least the next twelve months, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the financial and operational performance of the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) the Company s credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents, (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets and (v) the state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s consolidated assets included 859 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Of this amount, approximately 100 million is cash not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group s cash balance. 
 The principal uses of cash that affect the Company s liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs, paper purchases and programming costs; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; acquisitions; the repurchase of shares; dividends; and the repayment of debt and related interest. In addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the Company s securities or the assumption of indebtedness. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The Company s Board of Directors (the Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase program to purchase up to 1 billion in the aggregate of the Company s outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (the Repurchase Program ). The manner, timing, number and share price of any repurchases will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend upon such factors as the market price of the stock, general market conditions, applicable securities laws, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. The Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining authorized amount under the Repurchase Program was approximately 422 million. 
 Stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program commenced on November 9, 2021. The following table summarizes the shares repurchased and subsequently retired and the related consideration paid during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Dividends

The dividend was paid on October 9, 2024 to stockholders of record as of September 11, 2024. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the Company s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.

 Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow. 
 Free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company s consolidated Statements of Cash Flows prepared in accordance with GAAP, which incorporates all cash movements during the period. 
 The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company s liquidity and cash flow trends. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flow: 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 64 (55) Less: Capital expenditures (95) (124) Free cash flow (31) (179) 
 Free cash flow in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (31) million compared to (179) million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2024. Free cash flow improved primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities and lower capital expenditures.

Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable.

 23. Section 409A . 
 (a) This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and will be interpreted accordingly. References under this Agreement to the Executive s termination of employment shall be deemed to refer to the date upon which the Executive has experienced a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. 
 11 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if at the time of the Executive s separation from service with the Company, the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or other pronouncements thereunder) and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder or payable under any other compensatory arrangement between the Executive and the Company, or any of its affiliates as a result of such separation from service is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Executive) until the date that is six (6) months following the Executive s separation from service (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code), at which point all payments deferred pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum and (ii) if any other payments of money or other benefits due to the Executive hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax. Any payments deferred pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the applicable Federal rate for short-term instruments. 
 (c) To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to the Executive under this Agreement constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to the Executive in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). Additionally, to the extent that the Executive s receipt of any in-kind benefits from the Company or its affiliates must be delayed pursuant to this Section due to the Executive s status as a specified employee , the Executive may elect to instead purchase and receive such benefits during the period in which the provision of benefits would otherwise be delayed by paying the Company (or its affiliates) for the fair market value of such benefits (as determined by the Company in good faith) during such period. Any amounts paid by the Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reimbursed to the Executive (with interest thereon) as described above on the date that is six (6) months following the Executive s separation from service. 
 (d) Each payment made under this Agreement shall be designated as a separate payment within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. 
 (e) The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive shall notify the Company if the Executive believes that any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation, or benefits) would cause the Executive to incur any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code and, if the Company concurs with such belief after good faith review or the Company independently makes such determination, then the Company shall, after consulting with the Executive, use reasonable best efforts to reform such provision to comply with Section 409A of the Code through good faith modifications to the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with Section 409A of the Code. 
 (f) Any amount that the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed for any business-related expenses borne by the Executive under this Agreement will be reimbursed to the Executive as promptly as practicable and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the expenses are incurred. The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year. 
 12 

(g) Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. 
 (h) Unless this Agreement provides a specified and objectively determinable payment schedule to the contrary, to the extent that any payment of base salary or other compensation is to be paid for a specified continuing period of time beyond the Executive s termination of employment in accordance with the Company s payroll practices (or other similar term), the payments of such base salary or other compensation shall be made on a monthly basis. 
 (i) To the extent that severance payments or benefits pursuant to this Agreement are conditioned upon the execution and delivery by the Executive of a separation agreement and general release (and the expiration of any revocation rights provided therein) which could become effective in one of two (2) taxable years of the Executive depending on when the Executive executes and delivers such separation agreement and general release, any deferred compensation payment (which is subject to Section 409A of the Code) that is conditioned on execution of the separation agreement and general release shall be made within ten (10) days after the separation agreement and general release becomes effective and such revocation rights have lapsed, but not earlier than the first business day of the later of such taxable years. 
 24. Representations . The Company represents that the Company s execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder (a) has been authorized by all required corporate action on the part of the Company and (b) will not conflict with, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, any contract, agreement or arrangement to which the Company is a party.

22. Section 280G . 
 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that it shall be determined that any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the Payments ), would constitute an excess parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall reduce (but not below zero) the aggregate present value of the Payments under the Agreement to the Reduced Amount (as hereinafter defined), if reducing the Payments under this Agreement will provide the Executive with a greater net after- tax amount than would be the case if no such reduction was made. The Payments shall be reduced as described in the preceding sentence only if (I) the net amount of the Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income and payroll taxes on the reduced Payments), is greater than or equal to (2) the net amount of the Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income and payroll taxes on the Payments and the amount of Excise Tax (as hereinafter defined) to which the Executive would be subject with respect to the unreduced Payments). Any reduction shall be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. 
 (b) The Reduced Amount shall be an amount expressed in present value that maximizes the aggregate present value of Payments without causing any Payment under this Agreement to be subject to the Excise Tax, determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. The term Excise Tax means the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax. 
 (c) All determinations to be made under this Section 22 shall be made by an independent registered public accounting firm or consulting firm selected by the Company immediately prior to a change in control, which shall provide its determinations and any supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within ten I 0) days of the change in control. Any such determination by such firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. All fees and expenses of the accounting or consulting firm in performing the determinations referred to in this Section 22 shall be borne solely by the Company. 
 23. Section 409A . 
 (a) This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and will be interpreted accordingly. References under this Agreement to the Executive s termination of employment shall be deemed to refer to the date upon which the Executive has experienced a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. 
 11 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if at the time of the Executive s separation from service with the Company, the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or other pronouncements thereunder) and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder or payable under any other compensatory arrangement between the Executive and the Company, or any of its affiliates as a result of such separation from service is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Executive) until the date that is six (6) months following the Executive s separation from service (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code), at which point all payments deferred pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum and (ii) if any other payments of money or other benefits due to the Executive hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax. Any payments deferred pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the applicable Federal rate for short-term instruments. 
 (c) To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to the Executive under this Agreement constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to the Executive in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(l )(iv). Additionally, to the extent that the Executive s receipt of any in-kind benefits from the Company or its affiliates must be delayed pursuant to this Section due to the Executive s status as a specified employee , the Executive may elect to instead purchase and receive such benefits during the period in which the provision of benefits would otherwise be delayed by paying the Company (or its affiliates) for the fair market value of such benefits (as determined by the Company in good faith) during such period. Any amounts paid by the Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reimbursed to the Executive (with interest thereon) as described above on the date that is six (6) months following the Executive s separation from service. 
 (d) Each payment made under this Agreement shall be designated as a separate payment within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. 
 (e) The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive shall notify the Company if the Executive believes that any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation, or benefits) would cause the Executive to incur any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code and, if the Company concurs with such belief after good faith review or the Company independently makes such determination, then the Company shall, after consulting with the Executive, use reasonable best efforts to reform such provision to comply with Section 409A of the Code through good faith modifications to the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with Section 409A of the Code. 
 (f) Any amount that the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed for any business- related expenses borne by employee under this Agreement will be reimbursed to the Executive as promptly as practicable and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the expenses are incurred. Expenses eligible for reimbursement during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year. 
 12 

(g) Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. 
 (h) Unless this Agreement provides a specified and objectively determinable payment schedule to the contrary, to the extent that any payment of base salary or other compensation is to be paid for a specified continuing period of time beyond the Executive s termination of employment in accordance with the Company s payroll practices (or other similar term), the payments of such base salary or other compensation shall be made on a monthly basis. 
 (i) To the extent that severance payments or benefits pursuant to this Agreement are conditioned upon the execution and delivery by the Executive of a separation agreement and general release (and the expiration of any revocation rights provided therein) which could become effective in one of two (2) taxable years of the Executive depending on when the Executive executes and delivers such separation agreement and general release, any deferred compensation payment (which is subject to Section 409A of the Code) that is conditioned on execution of the separation agreement and general release shall be made within ten (10) days after the separation agreement and general release becomes effective and such revocation rights have lapsed, but not earlier than the first business day of the later of such taxable years. 
 24. Representations . The Company represents that the Company s execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder (a) has been authorized by all required corporate action on the part of the Company and (b) will not conflict with, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, any contract, agreement or arrangement to which the Company is a party. The Executive represents that the Executive s execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the Executive s obligations hereunder will not conflict with, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, any contract, agreement or arrangement to which the Executive is a party.
