NEXTTRIP,
INC. 

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 August
31, 2024 

Membership
Units of Group for Preferred Units of Group, with a value of per unit. Prior to the exchange for Preferred Units, Group had
a payable due to NextPlay of , representing cash advances and payment of expenses by NextPlay on behalf of Group, while NextPlay
had obligations to provide ongoing support to NextTrip. Such liability was settled by the issuance of the Preferred Units and the waiver
of all of NextPlay s ongoing support obligations except for a million advance remaining under a promissory note and as such
NextTrip recorded the payable as contributed capital. 

The
Company provides travel technology solutions with sales originating in the United States, with a primary emphasis on hotels, air, and
all-inclusive travel packages. Our proprietary booking engine, branded as NextTrip 2.0, provides travel distributors access to a sizeable
inventory. 

The
Company owns of Next Innovation LLC (Joint Venture) and this entity is in the process of a first structure plan. No activities nor
operations occurred in 2023 or 2024 for this entity, and NextTrip, Inc. does not have control of the company and therefore no minority
interest was recorded. 

Reverse
Acquisition 

On
October 12, 2023, Sigma entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (as amended, the Exchange Agreement with NextTrip, Group,
and William Kerby (the NextTrip Representative ). Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the parties agreed that Group
would sell and transfer to Sigma all of the issued and outstanding shares of NextTrip in exchange for restricted shares of Sigma
common stock (the Closing Shares ), issuable at closing, and the right to receive up to an additional restricted
shares of Sigma common stock upon satisfaction of certain milestones set forth in the Exchange Agreement (the Contingent Shares, 
and together with the Closing Shares, the Restricted Shares ), which Restricted Shares are issuable to the members of Group,
on a pro rata basis, under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, subject to certain closing conditions (the Acquisition ).
Upon the closing of the Acquisition on December 29, 2023, NextTrip became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sigma. 

The
Contingent Shares, together with the Closing Shares, will not exceed shares of Sigma common stock, or approximately of
the issued and outstanding shares of Sigma common stock immediately prior to the closing. The Acquisition will likely result in a change
of control, with the members of Group receiving an aggregate number of shares that exceeds the number of shares that held by the legacy
shareholders of Sigma. As a result, the Acquisition is accounted for as a reverse acquisition of NextTrip by Sigma, whereby Sigma is
treated as the legal acquirer and NextTrip is treated as the accounting acquirer. As a result, the historical financial information presented
is that of NextTrip. 

In
accordance with ASC 805 - 40 - 45 - 1, the consolidated financial statements prepared following a reverse acquisition
are issued under the name of the legal parent (NextTrip, Inc., f/k/a Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc.) but described in the notes to the
financial statements as a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (NextTrip), with one adjustment, which
is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That
adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent. Comparative information presented in the consolidated financial statements
also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent. 

Under
ASC 805 - 40 - 45 - 2, the consolidated financial statements represent the continuation of the legal subsidiary
except for the capital structure, as follows: 

(a) 
 The
 assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts; 

(b) 
 The
 assets and liabilities of the legal parent recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance in this topic applicable to business
 combinations (ASC 805); 

(c) 
 The
 retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary before the business combination; 

(d) 
 The
 amount required to be recognized as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued
 equity interest of the legal subsidiary outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent
 determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations. However, the equity structure reflects
 the equity structure of the legal parent, including the equity interests the legal parent issued to affect the combination. Accordingly,
 the equity structure of the legal subsidiary is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect
 the number of shares of the legal parent issued in the reverse acquisition. 

The
assets and liabilities of Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc. were recognized at fair value pursuant to ASC 805. 

Going
Concern The Company has sustained losses and had negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception. 

The
Company currently does not have sufficient cash and working capital to fund its operations and will require additional funding in the
public or private markets in the near-term to be able to continue operations. The Company currently has no understanding or agreement
to obtain such funding, and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding. If we fail to obtain sufficient
funding when needed, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate all or a portion of our commercialization efforts and operations.
As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

established as of February 29, 2024, as collectability of the entire receivable is uncertain. During the three and six months ended August
31, 2024, and 2023, there was bad debt expense recorded related to the allowance account, and the allowance is unchanged as of August
31, 2024. As of August 31, 2023, allowance for doubtful accounts was established.

The
Company leases approximately square feet of space for its principal executive offices at 3900 Paseo del Sol, Santa Fe, New Mexico
87507. The lease has a 6-month term which ends on December 31, 2024. The landlord can terminate the lease upon 30 days written notice
and NextTrip can terminate the lease upon 45 days written notice. Therefore, the Company has elected the short-term lease recognition

Preferred
Stock 

Under
our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended Articles ), our board of directors has the authority, without further action by
stockholders, to designate one or more series of preferred stock and to fix the voting powers, designations, preferences,
limitations, restrictions and relative rights granted to or imposed upon the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion
rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, liquidation preference and sinking fund terms, any or all of which may be
preferential to or greater than the rights of the common stock. 

Our
board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting
power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection
with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing
a change in our control and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders
of common stock. 

The
Company is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock, par value. An aggregate of and shares of preferred
stock were issued and outstanding at August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively. 

Series
E Convertible Preferred Stock

per annum will accrue and, on a monthly basis, shall be payable in kind by the increase of the Stated Value of the Series E
Preferred Stock by said amount. The holders of the Series E Preferred Shares have the right at any time to convert all or a portion
of the Series E Preferred Shares (including, without limitation, accrued and unpaid dividends and make-whole dividends through the
third anniversary of the closing date) into shares of the Company s common stock at an initial conversion rate determined by
dividing the Conversion Amount by the Conversion Price 
above the consolidated closing bid price for the trading day prior to the execution of the relates stock purchase agreement). The
Conversion Amount is the sum of the Stated Value of the Series E Preferred Shares then being converted plus any other unpaid amounts
payable with respect to the Series E Preferred Shares being converted, plus the Make Whole Amount (the amount of any
dividends that, but for the conversion, would have accrued at the dividend rate for the period through the third anniversary of the
initial issuance date). The Conversion Rate is also subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends recapitalizations and similar
events. 

At
August 31, 2024, shares of the issued Series E Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding, which if converted as of August 31,
2024, including the make-whole dividends, would have resulted in the issuance of shares of common stock.

Prior
to the Exchange Agreement, as described below, NextTrip Holdings, Inc. NextTrip was a wholly owned subsidiary of NextTrip
Group, LLC Group ), which in turn, was a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlay Technologies, Inc. NextPlay ).

operations occurred in 2024 or 2023 for this entity and NextTrip, Inc. does not have control of the company and therefore no minority
interest was recorded. 

Reverse
Acquisition 

On
October 12, 2023, Sigma entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (as amended, the Exchange Agreement with NextTrip, Group,
and William Kerby (the NextTrip Representative ). Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the parties agreed that Group
would sell and transfer to Sigma all of the issued and outstanding shares of NextTrip in exchange for 156,007 restricted shares of Sigma
common stock (the Closing Shares ), issuable at closing, and the right to receive up to an additional 5,843,993 restricted
shares of Sigma common stock upon satisfaction of certain milestones set forth in the Exchange Agreement (the Contingent Shares, 
and together with the Closing Shares, the Restricted Shares ), which Restricted Shares are issuable to the members of Group,
on a pro rata basis, under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, subject to certain closing conditions (the Acquisition ).
Upon the closing of the Acquisition on December 29, 2023, NextTrip became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sigma. 

The
Contingent Shares, together with the Closing Shares, will not exceed 6,000,000 shares of Sigma common stock, or approximately 90.2 of
the issued and outstanding shares of Sigma common stock immediately prior to the closing. The Acquisition will likely result in a change
of control, with the members of Group receiving an aggregate number of shares that exceeds the number of shares that held by the legacy
shareholders of Sigma. As a result, the Acquisition is accounted for as a reverse acquisition of NextTrip by Sigma, whereby Sigma is
treated as the legal acquirer and NextTrip is treated as the accounting acquirer. As a result, the historical financial information presented
is that of NextTrip. 

In
accordance with ASC 805 - 40 - 45 - 1, the consolidated financial statements prepared following a reverse acquisition
are issued under the name of the legal parent (NextTrip, Inc., f/k/a Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc.) but described in the notes to the
financial statements as a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (NextTrip), with one adjustment, which
is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That
adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent. Comparative information presented in the consolidated financial statements
also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent. 

Under
ASC 805 - 40 - 45 - 2, the consolidated financial statements represent the continuation of the legal subsidiary
except for the capital structure, as follows: 

(a) 
 The
 assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts; 

(b) 
 The
 assets and liabilities of the legal parent recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance in this topic applicable to business
 combinations (ASC 805); 

(c) 
 The
 retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary before the business combination; 

(d) 
 The
 amount required to be recognized as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued
 equity interest of the legal subsidiary outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent
 determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations. However, the equity structure reflects
 the equity structure of the legal parent, including the equity interests the legal parent issued to affect the combination. Accordingly,
 the equity structure of the legal subsidiary is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect
 the number of shares of the legal parent issued in the reverse acquisition. 

The
assets and liabilities of Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc. were recognized at fair value under ASC 805 as described in NOTE 4 Goodwill. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying
financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments, often employing
the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates
could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations. Significant accounting estimates that may materially change
in the near future are revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, values of stock compensation awards and stock equivalents
granted as offering costs, and allowance for bad debts and inventory obsolescence. Such critical accounting policies, including the assumptions
and judgments underlying them, are disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report. However,
we do not believe that there are any alternative methods of accounting for our operations that would have a material effect on our financial
statements.

identifying performance obligations in the contracts, determining transactions price, allocating transaction price to the performance
obligation and recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when the customer has purchased the product, the occurrence of the earlier of date of travel or the date of
cancellation has expired, as satisfaction of the performance obligation, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability
is reasonably assured. Revenue for customer travel packages purchased directly from the Company are recorded gross (the amount paid to
the Company by the customer is shown as revenue and the cost of providing the respective travel package is recorded to cost of revenues). 

The
Company generates revenues from sales directly to customers as well as through other distribution channels of tours and activities at
destinations throughout the world. 

The
Company controls the specified travel product before it is transferred to the customer and is therefore a principal, based on but not

Organizational
History 

Historical
Monaker Group Business 

NextTrip s
travel business was the principal business of NextPlay (then, Monaker Group, Inc. Monaker )) until June 30, 2020, when
Monaker entered into a share exchange transaction with HotPlay Enterprise Limited HotPlay ), resulting in HotPlay becoming
a wholly owned subsidiary of Monaker and HotPlay s business becoming the principal business of Monaker. Prior to this share exchange,
the primary focus of Monaker had been its travel business, which included the sale of vacation rentals, and in particular, ALRs, to consumers
through its proprietary booking engine. To support its travel offerings, Monaker introduced travelmagazine.com, featuring travel and
lifestyle content to appeal to travelers researching destinations and planning future vacations. In January 2023, NextPlay spun the NextTrip
business out to its founders to separate it from NextPlay s primary business. 

COVID-era
Transition and Technology Development 

The
spread of the COVID-19 virus globally beginning in January 2020 severely impacted our business. Beginning in March 2020, many U.S. states
and foreign countries began issuing stay-at-home orders and closed their borders to interstate and international travel.
Such restrictions on travel, together with other measures implemented by governments around the world, severely restricted the level
of economic activity around the world and had an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry. The public s ability to travel
was severely curtailed through border closures, mandated travel restrictions and limited operations of hotels, airlines, and additional
voluntary or mandated closures of travel-related businesses from December 2019 through the beginning of 2022 (and beyond in some jurisdictions).
Measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented levels of temporary and permanent business closures, cancellations
and limited new travel bookings, having a severe negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Due
to the significant decrease in demand for the travel related services provided by us during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted
our focus to developing and enhancing our program offerings. For example, we began to develop our online media platform -TravelMagazine.com
allowing consumers to research future travel options as well as enhancing the functionality of our booking engines, including developing
a booking engine platform that allows customers to book packaged vacations and wellness programs along with the development of a platform
to arrange and manage business travel. 

Acquisition
of Bookit.com Asset 

Following
NextTrip s separation from NextPlay, our team focused on the continued technological development of its booking platform. As
part of this development, we acquired a travel platform in June 2022 to help power our proprietary NXT 2.0 booking technology.
Previously, this technology powered the Bookit.com business, a well-established online leisure travel agent generating over 400
million in annual sales as recently as 2019 (pre-pandemic). As part of the acquisition of the assets of Bookit.com, we were not only
able to acquire a proven technology platform that could be integrated with our core travel sectors, but we were also able to secure
the Bookit.com database with millions of past travelers and opt-in consumers. 

Since
2022, and the acquisition of the Bookit.com business, we have been focused on the holistic development and integration of the NXT
2.0 technology platform, which serves as a base for current and future technology projects as well as proprietary system
enhancements. This integration includes re-engaging with and re-negotiating more than 250 contracts with hotel, airline, and cruise
suppliers, and securing unique product inventory of more than 3 million lodging, air and tour product suppliers at exceptional rates
to over 2,100 destinations in 200+ countries worldwide. 

Through
this strategic offering, we will focus on key areas of opportunity in the travel sector and drive enhanced booking conversion rates.
Our proprietary technology, when combined with media, product offerings and customer service, provides a unique lane to serve mid- to
luxury travelers. 

Recent
Developments 

Launch
of Compass.tv 

On
October 1, 2024, we announced the launch of our owned and operated Compass.tv travel discovery channel and app. The platform initially
features over a thousand hours of travel video content designed to seamlessly convert into commerce opportunities, allowing viewers to
book vacations directly through the channel using the NextTrip Booking Engine. In partnership with Dooya Media Group, the Company intends
to expand Compass.tv s offerings by collaborating with influencers who have millions of travel-focused followers, creating a unique
and comprehensive travel hub. 

24 

The
platform showcases authentic experiences through popular social media influencers, appealing to viewers who prefer real, relatable content
over polished productions. With influencer-promoted, destination-focused content, the Company believes that Compass.tv will serve as
a premier travel discovery tool, inspiring viewers to plan their next adventure. Its Content Creator Program incentivizes influencers
with a competitive revenue-sharing model, while integrating content-to-commerce funnels with targeted ads and affiliate travel offers.
As part of the NextTrip ecosystem, Compass.tv works in tandem with NextTrip s website, tools, and exclusive deals to drive bookings
and set a new standard for advertiser engagement with a dynamic, travel-driven audience. 

Launch
of Group Booking Technology Platform 

On
July 30, 2024, we announced the launch of a new Group Booking Platform Platform ), a proprietary technology for its direct-to-consumer
travel booking website offering travelers and facilitators a flexible and versatile solution for group travel. 

NextTrip s
Platform streamlines front-end booking flow for customers, empowering each traveler to book their own travel while still remaining part
of a group. This versatility allows travelers to book travel when it is most convenient for them. For group leaders, our Platform reduces
the workload by eliminating the need to follow up with travelers for details such as travel dates, flight information and room category.
Guests can also easily include pre- and post-stays and book activities. Access to the Platform can be sent in email invitations and implemented
on a variety of sites, such as conference and other customized websites. Future versions will include additional destination flexibility,
customization, and white label capabilities. 

Launch
of FlexPay Travel Payment Options 

On
July 11, 2024, we announced the launch of FlexPay, a proprietary technology for our direct-to-consumer travel booking website giving
customers new flexible payment options and exclusive deals. 

FlexPay
is a flexible form of short-term financing that allows customers to pay for accommodations over time through interest-free installments.
FlexPay differentiates itself from other travel booking sites with flexible payment and deposit options, exclusive deals, and does not
run credit checks or charge interest. Offered as a payment option at checkout, travelers can now book their vacation for as little as
 1.00 down at eligible properties. 

Acquisition
by Sigma; Name Change 

In
December 2023, we completed the Acquisition, which resulted in NextTrip becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company and the
principal business of the Company moving forward. To align the new business with NextTrip s travel-focused business model, the
Company recently changed its name to NextTrip, Inc. 

Our
Fully Integrated Travel Booking Platform 

We
have established a direct-to-consumer presence though a number of websites, powered by the NXT 2.0 booking platform. Today, the
primary leisure platform is hosted on nexttrip.com and the media platform is hosted on travelmagazine.com. 

NextTrip
sells travel services to leisure and corporate customers across these websites. Our primary focus is our current offerings of scheduling,
pricing and availability information for booking reservations for airlines, hotels, rental cars, as well as other travel products such
as transfers, sightseeing tours, shows and event tickets. NextTrip sells these travel services both individually and as components of
dynamically assembled packaged travel vacations and trips. In addition, we provide content that presents travelers with information about
travel destinations, maps and other travel details. 

Our
online travel publication, travelmagazine.com, provides travelers around the world with inspiration for future vacation destinations
and trips. The publication offers written articles, videos, and podcasts. The website is expected to be supported by advertising and
allow for research and booking of vacation products. 

25 

Travel
Products and Services 

We
are building an ecosystem with technology and product offerings that will include leisure travel, wellness travel, business travel, alternative
lodging, technology and media solutions. We engage with consumers and distributors throughout the travel planning journey from planning
through post-travel. Through direct relationships, we have established robust product offerings and preferred rates across the top destinations
world-wide. Our primary product offerings are as follows: 

NextTrip
 Leisure brings travel solutions and a proprietary booking engine that allows customers to book customized travel, including vacation
 packages, airline tickets, hotel reservations, tours and activities, curated journeys, cruises, wellness and group travel. 

NextTrip
 Solutions offers technology solutions for product and inventory management as well as white label offerings including NextTrip products
 under their brand, and technology solutions. We are also developing a travel agent portal to drive bookings and travel agent brand
 loyalty. 

NextTrip
 Media includes Travel Magazine and the Compass.tv experience, which is currently in development. These digital solutions engage consumers
 at the initial phases of travel planning, offering relevant content, destination information and immersive online experiences as
 well as solutions for travel suppliers. This ecosystem, once fully developed, is expected to allow users to create their own fully
 customized FAST channel featuring vacation journey opportunities that customers can explore prior to booking the actual vacation. 

Products
and Services for Travelers 

Search
Tools and Ability to Compare . Our online marketplace nexttrip.com provides travelers with the tools to search for and filter several
travel products including air, car, accommodations, and activities based on various criteria, such as destination, travel
dates, type of property, number of bedrooms, amenities, price, or keywords. 

Traveler
Login. Travelers are able to create accounts on our website(s) that give them access to their booking activity through the website.
Members will also have access to special rates and discounts on the NextTrip product. 

Travel
Blog. Travel guides, videos and pictures as well as travel articles can be accessed through travelmagazine.com. 

Security.
 We use a combination of technology and human review to evaluate the content of listings and to screen for inaccuracies or fraud with
the goal of providing only accurate and trustworthy information to travelers. NextTrip is Payment Card Industry compliant to ensure the
safety and security of its customer credit card data. 

Communication.
 Travelers who create an account on our websites will receive regular communications, including notices about places of interest,
special offers, new listings, and an email newsletter. The newsletter will be available to any traveler who agrees to receive it and
offers introductions to new destinations and properties, as well as tips and useful information when traveling. 

Since
the COVID-19 pandemic arose, we have primarily focused on developing our booking engine and establishing relationships with suppliers
to increase the size of our instantly bookable inventory. The booking engine has produced little revenue to date because of, among other
reasons, the efforts that have been taken to integrate the NextTrip travel platforms with the Bookit.com technology since its acquisition
in the summer of 2022. The new platform was launched in beta in May 2023 with a limited number of hotel properties in Mexico and the
Caribbean. We have expanded our distribution since launch to include over one million hotel properties worldwide and completed a
full launch of the leisure travel website in August 2024. 

Key
Revenue Drivers 

NextTrip s
fully integrated travel booking platform serves as the foundation of our revenue-generating business. The platform contains a robust
booking engine with merchandising capabilities that drive increased conversions and higher per revenue transactions. We plan to leverage
the bookit.com foundational travel database consisting of several million customers to further drive revenues. Those revenues consist
primarily of commissions and bookings but are expanding to include affiliate commerce, advertising and sponsored content (via Compass.tv
and Travel Magazine). 

26 

In
addition, as the booking platform expands, it establishes an opportunity for product expansion and revenue from technology licensing,
including white-labeling key technology. A monthly software-as-a-service SaaS model is being established around key technology
developments and innovative platforms, including turn-key booking solutions, product management and targeted audience offerings. 

Advancing
Travel: Future Research Development Driving Growth 

As
we expand the reach of our booking platforms, including to different underserved areas of the travel industry, we plan to focus on future
technologies to drive growth by investing in research and development. 

Compass.tv 

As
FAST gains momentum globally, we are in the process of developing Compass.tv, which was soft launched on October 1, 2024. Our innovative
travel channel is being developed in conjunction with our perpetual license with Promethean discussed above. With over 1,000 hours of
relevant travel content secured, Compass.tv intends to utilize artificial intelligence AI to personalize content, convert
blogs and articles to video, and empower users to create custom travel channels. Integration with the NextTrip Concierge desk will enable
seamless booking and assistance. 

NextTrip
recognizes the pivotal role of video in promoting travel sales and engagement, hence our focus on incorporating video across platforms.
To maximize effectiveness, NextTrip has entered into the license with Promethean enabling targeted advertising and transactional capabilities
without interrupting content. 

Travel
Magazine 

We
are transforming our Travel Magazine website into a social media platform catering to all things travel. The site was re-launched
mid-2024, and features enhanced media capabilities and targeted advertising using the Promethean solution. A private consumer
section called My Bucket List, is targeted for release in early 2025 and will feature connectivity to booking
engines, AI travel planner assist and AI-driven content creation. 

My
Bucket List 

With
My Bucket List, NextTrip is building a technology solution catered to travelers to build and share their own travel bucket list with
personalized suggestions, booking support and local insights.

services increased by 74,590, and Travel Magazine costs increased by 1,537. 

We
incurred technology costs of 325,691 during the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to 119,680 during the same period in
2023. The increase of 206,011, or 172 , was primarily attributable to an increase in dues and subscription services of 157,621 for external
travel services used in connection with our booking engine, and an increase cloud database and software expenses of 48,790 to host the
booking engine. 

Professional
service fees incurred in the six months ended August 31, 2024 were 895,900, as compared to 260,304 incurred during the same period
in 2023, an increase of 635,596, or 244 . This increase was a result of: (a) an increase in investor relations expenses of
 209,946; (b) an increase in legal expense of 163,495 due to the reverse acquisition and associated transactions; (c) an increase
in accounting fees of 110,510 for audit and related financial services; and (d) an increase in consultants contracted for services
of 151,645 for management and administrative services related to the company s media initiatives, special projects including
establishing travel related partnerships, 

Organizational
costs for the six months ended August 31, 2024, were 109,189, as compared to 0 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 109,189.
The increase resulted primarily from directors compensation, and shareholder services expenses including transfer agent fees, and filing
services. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 383,000, as compared to 667,889 for the same period in 2023,
a decrease of 284,889, or 43 . The decrease was primarily due to no new equipment purchases and an increase in fully amortized intangible
assets as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Other
operating expenses were 179,655 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to 17,731 for the same period in 2023. The 161,924
increase was primarily due to the additional cost for insurance of 124,079, an increase in merchant processing fees of 33,765, and
an increase in filing and other fees of 4,080. 

29 

In
the six months ended August 31, 2024, we realized net other expense of 99,452, as compared to net other expense of 139,151 in the same
period in 2023. The decrease in net other income of 39,699 was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense associated with convertible
loans due to their conversion in December 2023. 

Preferred
dividends for the six months ended August 31, 2024 were 21,376, as compared to 0 for the same period in 2023. The increase was due
to dividends associated with outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock assumed in the reverse acquisition of Sigma. 

In
the six months ended August 31, 2024, the net loss from continuing operations totaled 3,521,145, as compared to a net loss from continuing
operations of 2,256,134 for the same period in 2023. The operating loss component increased by 1,304,710 in 2024, partially offset
by a decrease in the other loss component of 39,699. 

The
net gain from discontinued operations of 7,778 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 consisted primarily of revenue of 14,731 from
legacy Sigma customers, and a gain of 6,011 from the settlement of a trade accounts payable at a discount, partially offset by expenses
of 12,964 consisting of legal expenses, termination of a subscription contract, and Sigma s legacy investor relations website. 

Our
net loss applicable to common stockholders for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 3,534,743, as compared to 2,256,134 for the
same period in 2023, an increase of 1,278,609, or 57 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating loss from
continued operations of 1,304,710 and an increase in preferred dividends of 21,376, partially offset by a gain from discontinued operations
of 7,778, and a decrease in other expense of 39,699. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Due
to uncertainties regarding our ability to meet our current and future operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report, 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had 102,006 in cash and a working capital deficit of 3,664,705, as compared with 323,805 in cash and a working
capital deficit of 262,005 as of February 29, 2024. Additionally, at August 31, 2024, the amount due under our notes payable to related
parties totaled 2,718,594. 

Between
September 1, 2024 and October 11, 2024, additional net related party advances totaled 80,060, and the aggregate outstanding principal
balance of related party advances as of October 11, 2024 was 2,802,654. 

On
September 13, 2024, the Company s board of directors approved the conversion of up to 100 of the outstanding principal balance
of the promissory notes held by Messrs. Kerby and Monaco into shares of a series of non-redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred
stock yet to be designated. Messrs. Kerby and Monaco have agreed to initially convert 1,500,000, or 56.3 of their total outstanding
principal balance of 2,666,790 into the new series of convertible preferred stock, and, at their discretion, may convert up to the remaining
principal balance, or any portion thereof, into additional shares of such convertible preferred stock at a future date. The conversion
remains subject to completion of final documentation for the transaction, including the filing of the certificate of designation for
the new series of convertible preferred stock with the Nevada Secretary of State. 

On
September 19, 2024 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Note Warrant SPA with Alumni
Capital LP Alumni Capital for the sale of a short-term promissory note (the Alumni Note and warrants Warrants to Alumni Capital for total consideration of 250,000. After deducting commissions, net proceeds to the
Company were 230,000. 

The
Alumni Note is in the principal amount of 300,000 with an original issue discount of 50,000 and guaranteed interest on the
principal amount of ten percent (10 per annum which shall be due and payable on December 19, 2024. In the event of a failure to
re-pay the Alumni Note on or before December 19, 2024, the interest rate will increase to the lesser of twenty-two percent (22 per
annum or the maximum amount permitted under law from the due date thereof until the same is paid. The Alumni Note is convertible
into common stock of the Company only upon an event of default. 

On
September 19, 2024, the Company also entered into a Common Stock Securities Purchase Agreement (the Common Stock SPA with
Alumni Capital. Pursuant to the Common Stock SPA, the Company has the right, but not the obligation to cause Alumni Capital to purchase
up to 10 million shares of common stock (the Commitment Amount at the Purchase Price (defined below) during the period
beginning on the execution date of the Common Stock SPA and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which Alumni Capital has purchased
 10 million shares of common stock pursuant to the Common Stock SPA or (ii) December 31, 2025. Pursuant
to the Common Stock SPA, the Purchase Price means the lowest traded price of Company common stock during the five (5) business
days prior a closing date multiplied by eighty nine percent (89 ). No Purchase Notice will be made without an effective registration
statement and no Purchase Notice will be in an amount greater than 500,000. 

On
October 1, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor for the sale of 66,225 shares of Series I
Convertible Preferred Stock at 3.02 per share, for total consideration of 200,000.

Our
major sources of funding have been proceeds from private offerings of our securities, advances from related parties, and issuance of
convertible and non-convertible debt. We will need to raise additional amounts to fund our operations, maintain compliance with the Nasdaq
continued listing requirements and implement our business plan. We currently have no arrangement to obtain any additional financing,
and there is no assurance as to the amount and availability of any required future financing or the terms thereof. Any such financing,
if in the form of equity, may be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders and may otherwise include onerous terms. If in the form
of debt, such financing may include covenants and repayment obligations which may be difficult to meet and that could adversely affect
our business and operations. To the extent that funds are not available to us, we may be required to delay, limit, or terminate our business
and operations and/or lose our Nasdaq listing. 

Our
existing cash on hand and anticipated revenues are not sufficient to fund our anticipated operating costs. We estimate that we will need
to raise a minimum of 5.5 million in net proceeds to continue operation for the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect, or extend such resources longer than we
expect. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research, development, and commercialization of our products, however, we
are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,
including without limitation: 

The
 cost of developing and maintaining our proprietary software and NXT 2.0 booking engine; 

The
 effect of competing technological and market developments; 

The
 revenue from the sales of our existing and future products; and 

The
 cost of operating as a public company. 

The
effects of a U.S. or global recession, while difficult to predict, could result in some customers delaying or cancelling planned travel. 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the six months ended August 31, 2024 totaled 1,960,326, as compared
to 1,393,118 during the same period in 2023, an increase of 567,208, or 41 . 

During
the six months ended August 31, 2024, the net cash used in operating activities was the result of a net loss of 3,521,145 before preferred
dividends, partially offset by changes in working capital of 1,147,584, and non-cash expenses of 413,235 related to depreciation and
amortization of 383,000 and stock-based compensation of 30,235. Changes in working capital were driven by a decrease in accounts receivable
of 22,881, a decrease in prepaid expenses of 96,051, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1,033,506, partially
offset by an increase in security deposits of 3,000 and a decrease in deferred revenue of 1,854. 

During
the six months ended August 31, 2023, the net cash used in operating activities was the result of a net loss of 2,256,134, partially
offset by changes inworking capital of 120,279, and non-cash expenses of 742,737 related to depreciation and amortization. Changes
in working capital were driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 110,959 and an increase in deferred revenue
of 57,156, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 5,000, an increase of 34,114 in prepaid expenses, and a decrease
in notes receivable of 8,722. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities during the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 389,568, which compares to 345,807 of cash used in
investing activities during the same period of 2023, an increase of 43,761, or 13 . The increase resulted from an increase in capitalized
software development costs during the period. 

31 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 2,120,317, as compared to 1,562,352 for the same
period in 2023. The increase of 557,965, or 36 , was due to an increase in advances from related parties of 1,597,817, the issuance
of promissory notes for 140,000 to investors, and the issuance of preferred shares to investors for 90,000, partially offset by a decrease
in the issuance of convertible notes of 1,269,852. 

Our
ability to continue to fund our working capital needs will be dependent upon the success of our efforts to generate revenues from
our operations, and by obtaining additional capital from the sale of securities or by borrowing funds from lenders to fulfill our
business plans. If we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. There is no assurance
that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding. The Company is unable to predict the effect a global recession or
geopolitical events, including the on-going conflicts in Ukraine and Israel/Palestine, may have on its access to the financing markets. If we fail to
obtain sufficient funding when needed, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate all or a portion of our commercialization
efforts and operations. 

Other
than the related party promissory notes as described in Notes 5, 6 and 9 to the financial statements included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, we have no lines of credit or other financing arrangements. 

Inflation,
changing prices and rising interest rates have had no material effect on our continuing operations over our two most recent fiscal years.
However, continued unfavorable trends may affect the prices we pay for materials and other goods and services necessary to our business,
thus increasing our use of cash. 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures and changes in internal controls over financial reporting. 

Rule
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), defines the term disclosure
controls and procedures as those controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Based
upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our management, with the participation
of our President and Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, as of the end of the period covered by this
quarterly report, management identified a material weakness in disclosure controls and procedures related to a lack of personnel with
sufficient expertise in generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Specifically, the Company did not have individuals
with extensive GAAP experience to adequately assess and apply GAAP requirements in the preparation and review of financial disclosures.
As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of August 31, 2024 the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. 

During
the six months ended August 31, 2024, management took steps to remediate the material weakness discussed above by hiring additional personnel
with GAAP expertise, in particular the Company s Controller, and engaging external consultants with subject matter expertise as
necessary. Management also began implementing several enhancements to its control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act), including, but not limited to, establishing a monthly financial closing process, implementing account reconciliations,
ensuring proper segregation of duties, and implementing new financial control software. These remediation efforts were completed by August
31, 2024. 

As
a result of these enhancements, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as of and
for the periods presented.

1A. RISK FACTORS. 

You
should consider the Risk Factors included under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29,
2024 filed with the SEC on September 4, 2024, as well as the following updated Risk Factor: 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had 102,006 in cash and a working capital deficit of 3,664,705. Our existing cash on hand and anticipated revenues
are not sufficient to fund our anticipated operating costs. We will need to raise additional financing to fund our operations, maintain
compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements and implement our business plan. There is no assurance as to the amount and
availability of any required future financing or the terms thereof. Such financing, if in the form of equity, may be highly dilutive
to our existing stockholders and may otherwise include onerous terms. If in the form of debt, such financing may include covenants and
repayment obligations which may be difficult to meet and that could adversely affect our business operations. We have no current understanding
or arrangement to obtain any additional financing. To the extent that funds are not available to us, we may be required to delay, limit,
or terminate our business operations and may lose our Nasdaq listing. 

In
light of the foregoing, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date of the
filing of this Quarterly Report, 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On
August 15, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor for the sale of 4,967 shares of Series I Convertible

1.
I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of NextTrip, Inc.;
