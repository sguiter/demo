 The Company monitors its investment securities available for sale for credit loss impairment on an individual security basis. No securities were determined to be credit loss impaired during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company did not have an intent to sell securities that were in significant unrealized loss positions, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. In making this determination, the Company considered its current and projected liquidity position including its ability to pledge securities to generate liquidity, its investment policy as to permissible holdings and concentration limits, regulatory requirements and other relevant factors. We have not sold, and do not anticipate the need to sell, securities in unrealized loss positions to generate liquidity. 
 At September 30, 2024, securities available for sale were in unrealized loss positions. The amount of impairment related to of these securities was considered insignificant both individually and in the aggregate, totaling approximately million and no further analysis with respect to these securities was considered necessary. 
 The basis for concluding that AFS securities were not credit loss impaired and no ACL was considered necessary at September 30, 2024, is further discussed below. 
 Unrealized losses were primarily attributable to a sustained higher interest rate environment and in some cases, wider spreads compared to levels at which securities were purchased. The investment securities AFS portfolio was in a net unrealized loss position of million at September 30, 2024, compared to million at December 31, 2023, improving by million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. While the majority of securities in the portfolio were floating rate at September 30, 2024, fixed rate securities accounted for the majority of unrealized losses. 
 U.S. Government, U.S. Government Agency and Government Sponsored Enterprise Securities 
 At September 30, 2024, U.S. treasury, U.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise residential MBS, U.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise commercial MBS, and SBA securities were in unrealized loss positions. The timely payment of principal and interest on these securities is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government. As such, there is an assumption of zero credit loss and the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of these securities.

private label residential MBS and CMOs were in unrealized loss positions. Our analysis of cash flows expected to be collected on these securities incorporated assumptions about collateral default rates, voluntary prepayment rates, loss severity, delinquencies and recovery lag. In developing those assumptions, we took into account collateral quality measures such as FICO, LTV, documentation, loan type, property type, agency availability criteria and performing status. We also regularly monitor sector data including home price appreciation, forbearance, delinquency, special servicing and prepay trends as well as other economic data that could be indicative of stress in the sector. Underlying delinquencies in this sector remain low. Our September 30, 2024 analysis projected weighted average collateral losses for impaired securities in this category of compared to weighted average credit support of . As of September 30, 2024, of impaired securities in this category, based on carrying value, were externally rated AAA and were rated AA. 
 Private label commercial MBS 
 At September 30, 2024, private label commercial MBS were in unrealized loss positions. Our analysis of cash flows expected to be collected on these securities incorporated assumptions about collateral default rates, voluntary prepayment rates, loss severity, delinquencies and recovery lag. In developing those assumptions, we took into account collateral quality and type, loan size, loan purpose and other qualitative factors. We also regularly monitor collateral concentrations, collateral watch lists, bankruptcy data, defeasance data, special servicing trends, delinquency and other economic data that could be indicative of stress in the sector. We consider collateral, deal, sector and tranche level performance as well as maturity and refinance risk. While we have observed some deterioration in collateral performance in this segment, particularly in the office sector, the high credit quality of these securities and adequacy of subordination to cover projected collateral losses supports the conclusion that there is no credit loss impairment. Our September 30, 2024 analysis projected weighted average collateral losses for impaired securities in this category of compared to weighted average credit support of . As of September 30, 2024, of impaired securities in this category, based on carrying value, were externally rated AAA, were rated AA and were rated A. There is no single-asset, single-borrower exposure. 
 Single family real estate-backed securities 
 At September 30, 2024, single family rental real estate-backed securities were in unrealized loss positions. Our analysis of cash flows expected to be collected on these securities incorporated assumptions about collateral default rates, loss severity, delinquencies and recovery lag. We regularly monitor sector data including home price appreciation, forbearance, delinquency and prepay trends as well as other economic data that could be indicative of stress in the sector. We consider collateral, deal, sector and tranche level performance as well as maturity and refinance risk.

collateralized loan obligations were in unrealized loss positions. Unrealized losses totaled less than 1 of total amortized cost of this segment at September 30, 2024. Our analysis of cash flows expected to be collected on these securities incorporated assumptions about collateral default rates, loss severity, and delinquencies, calibrated to take into account idiosyncratic risks associated with the underlying collateral. In developing those assumptions, we took into account each sector s performance pre-, during and post the 2008 financial crisis. We regularly engage with bond managers to monitor trends in underlying collateral including potential downgrades and subsequent cash flow diversions, liquidity, ratings migration, and any other relevant developments. While we have observed some deterioration in underlying collateral performance due in large part to rising costs, the high credit quality of these securities and adequacy of subordination to cover projected collateral losses supports the conclusion that there is no credit loss impairment. Our September 30, 2024 analysis projected weighted average collateral losses for impaired securities in this category of compared to weighted average credit support of . As of September 30, 2024, of the impaired securities in this category, based on carrying value, were externally rated AAA. 
 Non-mortgage asset-backed securities 
 At September 30, 2024, non-mortgage asset-backed securities were in unrealized loss positions. These securities are backed by student loan collateral. Our analysis of cash flows expected to be collected on these securities incorporated assumptions about collateral default rates, loss severity, delinquencies, voluntary prepayment rates and recovery lag. In developing assumptions, we took into account collateral type, delineated by whether collateral consisted of loans to borrowers in school, refinancing, or a mixture. Our September 30, 2024 analysis projected weighted average collateral losses for impaired securities in this category of compared to weighted average credit support of . As of September 30, 2024, of the impaired securities in this category, based on carrying value, were externally rated AAA, and were rated AA. 
 State and Municipal Obligations 
 state and municipal obligations were in unrealized loss positions. Our analysis of potential credit loss impairment for these securities incorporates a quantitative measure of the underlying obligor's credit worthiness provided by a third-party vendor as well as other relevant qualitative considerations. As of September 30, 2024, of the impaired securities in this category, based on carrying value, were externally rated AAA and were rated AA .

 The ACL increased by million, to of total loans at September 30, 2024 from of total loans at December 31, 2023. The more significant factors increasing the ACL for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were an increase in specific reserves and risk rating migration, an increase in qualitative reserves, and changes in portfolio composition and characteristics. These factors increasing the ACL were partially offset by an improved economic forecast and net charge-offs.

million to million, are re-evaluated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. The special mention rating is considered a transitional rating for loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that could result in deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date if not checked or corrected and that deserve management s close attention. These borrowers may exhibit declining cash flows or revenues or increasing leverage. Loans with well-defined credit weaknesses that may result in a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected are assigned a risk rating of substandard. These borrowers may exhibit payment defaults, inadequate cash flows from current operations, operating losses, increasing balance sheet leverage, project cost overruns, unreasonable construction delays, exhausted interest reserves, declining collateral values, frequent overdrafts or past due real estate taxes. Loans with weaknesses so severe that collection in full is highly questionable or improbable, but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors have not been charged off, are assigned an internal risk rating of doubtful.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to focus on significant matters impacting and changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes hereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and BKU's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K").

 Overview 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 61.5 million, or 0.81 per diluted share, compared to 47.0 million, or 0.63 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 163.2 million, or 2.17 per diluted share, compared to 157.9 million, or 2.11 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the annualized return on average stockholders' equity was 8.1 and the annualized return on average assets was 0.62 . 
 In evaluating our financial performance, we consider the level of and trends in net interest income, the net interest margin, the cost of deposits, trends in non-interest income and non-interest expense, performance ratios such as the return on average equity and return on average assets and asset quality ratios, including the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans, non-performing assets to total assets, trends in criticized and classified assets and portfolio delinquency and charge-off trends. We consider the composition of earning assets and the funding mix, the composition and level of available liquidity and our interest rate risk profile. We analyze these ratios and trends against our own historical performance, our expected performance, our risk appetite and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions. 
 We are focused on improving the Company's core profitability by emphasizing the following near-term strategic priorities: 
 Improve the Bank's funding profile by growing core deposits and paying down higher cost wholesale funding; 
 Improve the asset mix by re-positioning the balance sheet away from typically lower yielding transactional business such as residential mortgages and organically growing core commercial loans; 
 Improve the net interest margin, largely a function of more profitable balance sheet composition; 
 Maintain robust liquidity and capital; 
 Continue to manage credit; 
 Manage the rate of growth in operating expenses. 
 35 

To date, we have made notable progress executing on these near-team strategic priorities: 
 The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, expanded by 0.06 , to 2.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.72 for the immediately preceding three months ended June 30, 2024. The net interest margin was 2.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the net interest margin improved to 2.69 from 2.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The average cost of total deposits declined by 0.03 to 3.06 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.09 for the immediately preceding three months ended June 30, 2024. The spot APY of total deposits declined to 2.93 at September 30, 2024 from 3.09 at June 30, 2024 . The average cost of interest bearing deposits declined by 0.06 to 4.20 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.26 for the immediately preceding three months ended June 30, 2024 while the spot APY of interest bearing deposits declined to 4.01 at September 30, 2024 from 4.29 at June 30, 2024. 
 The Company's funding profile has improved significantly over the course of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, wholesale funding, including FHLB advances and brokered deposits, declined by 1.9 billion, while non-brokered deposits grew by 1.7 billion, including an increase of 800 million in NIDDA. 
 Average NIDDA remained relatively stable, declining by 64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with the prior three months ended June 30, 2024 at 27 of average total deposits. Total deposits grew by 93 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In part due to expected seasonal trends, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, NIDDA declined by 430 million and represented 27 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. 
 FHLB advances increased by 295 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024; this increase was related to intraday cash management activity and is also reflected in temporarily elevated cash balances. Brokered deposits grew by 303 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as we took advantage of favorable pricing in the brokered deposit market. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our CRE and C I loan portfolios grew by 286 million while residential loans declined by 422 million and franchise, equipment and municipal finance declined by a combined 238 million, all reflective of our balance sheet repositioning strategy. 
 Total loans declined by 230 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The commercial real estate segment grew by 34 million while the C I segment declined by 112 million, impacted by some unanticipated payoffs and strategic exits. Mortgage warehouse grew by 33 million. Consistent with our balance sheet strategy, the residential, franchise, equipment and municipal finance declined by a combined 185 million. 
 The loan to deposit ratio declined to 87.6 at September 30, 2024, from 88.7 at June 30, 2024 and 92.8 at December 31, 2023. 
 Net charge-offs remained low and were 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The annualized net charge-off ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.12 . The NPA ratio at September 30, 2024 was 0.64 , including 0.10 related to the guaranteed portion of non-performing SBA loans, compared to 0.50 , including 0.11 related to the guaranteed portion of non-performing SBA loans at June 30, 2024. 
 The ratio of the ACL to total loans increased to 0.94 at September 30, 2024; the ratio of the ACL to non-performing loans was 101.68 . The ACL to loans ratio for commercial portfolio sub-segments including C I, CRE, franchise finance and equipment finance was 1.41 at September 30, 2024 and the ACL to loans ratio for CRE office loans was 2.20 . 
 Commercial real estate exposure is modest totaling 25 of loans and 164 of the Bank's total risk-based capital at September 30, 2024. By comparison, based on call report data as of June 30, 2024 for banks with between 10 billion and 100 billion in assets, the median level of CRE to total loans was 35 and the median level of CRE to total risk based capital was 220 . 
 Total same day available liquidity was 15.0 billion, the available liquidity to uninsured, uncollateralized deposits ratio was 147 and an estimated 63 of our deposits were insured or collateralized at September 30, 2024. 
 36 

At September 30, 2024, CET1 was 11.8 and pro-forma CET1, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was 10.9 . The ratio of tangible common equity/tangible assets increased to 7.6 . 
 The net unrealized pre-tax loss on the AFS securities portfolio continued to improve, declining by 125 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing 4 of amortized cost. The duration of our AFS securities portfolio remained short at 1.73 at September 30, 2024. HTM securities were not significant. 
 Book value and tangible book value per common share grew to 37.56 and 36.52, respectively, at September 30, 2024, from 36.11 and 35.07, respectively, at June 30, 2024. 
 
 Hurricanes Helene and Milton 
 Hurricane Helene made landfall along Florida's "Big Bend" coast in September 2024, ultimately impacting parts of the Southeastern United States. The impact of Hurricane Helene on BankUnited's operations was not significant, and is not expected to be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida in October 2024, bringing heavy rain, hurricane or tropical storm force winds, storm surge and power outages to portions of the Florida peninsula. All of our branches and office locations have re-opened for business, and damage to our facilities from the storm was negligible. There were no significant impacts to banking operations. The Company had approximately 3.7 billion UPB, based on September 30, 2024 balances, of loans within a 34 county assessment area incorporating the direct path of Hurricane Milton and adjacent counties. Included in the 3.7 billion UPB of loans are approximately 200 million of residential loans, the substantial majority of which are government-insured and thus have zero expectation of credit losses. As of November 1, 2024, we have contacted the majority of borrowers with potential exposure in the commercial loan portfolio. No borrowers reported severe impact from the storm. In the commercial portfolio, borrowers representing approximately 122 million in UPB reported some impact on their properties or businesses. Of this, approximately 50 million reported mild or moderate impact, with the remaining 72 million reporting no damage. As of November 1, 2024, the Company had not received any requests for payment deferrals or other accommodations resulting from the storm. Although we are still in the process of finalizing our assessment, based on information collected to date, we do not expect the impact of the storm to be material to our financial condition, results of operations or to the ACL. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is the primary driver of core earnings. Net interest income is impacted by the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources, movements in market interest rates and monetary policy, the shape of the yield curve, levels of non-performing assets and pricing pressure from competitors. 
 The mix of interest earning assets is influenced by loan demand, market and competitive conditions in our primary lending markets, by management's continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of earning assets and liquidity considerations. The mix of funding sources is influenced by the Company's liquidity profile, management's assessment of the desire for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers, our ability to attract and retain core deposit relationships, competition for deposits in the Company's markets and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of taxable equivalent interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances presented in this table; however, interest income foregone on non-accrual loans is not included. Interest income, yields, spread and margin have been calculated on a tax-equivalent basis for loans and investment securities that are exempt from federal income taxes, at a federal tax rate of 21 (dollars in thousands):

 Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the immediately preceding three months ended June 30, 2024 
 Net interest income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 238.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 230.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 8.0 million. The increase in net interest income was comprised of increases in tax-equivalent interest income and expense of 9.0 million and 1.0 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.72 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 The average cost of total deposits declined to 3.06 from 3.09 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities declined to 4.24 from 4.28 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The yield on average interest earning assets increased to 5.79 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 5.77 for the prior quarter. 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 238.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 219.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 18.9 million. The increase was comprised of increases in tax-equivalent interest income and interest expense of 21.4 million and 2.5 million, respectively. 
 39 

Net interest income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 686.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 669.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 17.5 million. The increase was comprised of increases in tax-equivalent interest income and interest expense of 81.8 million and 64.3 million, respectively. 
 Increases in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflected rising yields on interest earning assets that more than offset the decline in average interest earning assets. Similarly, increases in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulted from increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities that more than offset the decline in average interest bearing liabilities. 
 The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 2.78 and 2.69 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 2.56 and 2.55 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of balance sheet repositioning, particularly an improved funding mix. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, average NIDDA increased by 447 million while average FHLB advances declined by 2.3 billion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, average NIDDA was stable while average FHLB advances declined by 2.6 billion. 
 Increased yields on average interest earning assets as well as increases in the cost of deposits reflected the impact of a sustained higher rate environment. 
 Further discussion of factors impacting the net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 follows: 
 The tax-equivalent yield on loans increased to 5.87 and 5.84 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.54 and 5.33 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . These increases reflected the origination of new loans at higher rates, coupon resets, paydowns of lower-rate loans and balance sheet repositioning. 
 The tax-equivalent yield on investment securities increased to 5.62 and 5.60 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.48 and 5.20 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases resulted primarily from the reset of coupon rates on variable rate securities, purchases of higher-yielding securities and paydowns and sales of lower-yielding securities. 
 The average cost of interest bearing deposits increased to 4.20 and 4.22 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.76 and 3.34 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases primarily reflected the ongoing impact of higher prevailing market interest rates. 
 The average rate paid on FHLB advances decreased to 4.27 and 4.24 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.57 and 4.48 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to repayment of higher rate advances, partially offset by maturities of some cash flow hedges . 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is a charge or credit to earnings required to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management s estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost at the balance sheet date. The amount of the provision is impacted by changes in current economic conditions as well as in management's reasonable and supportable economic forecast, loan originations and runoff, changes in portfolio mix, risk rating migration and portfolio seasoning, changes in specific reserves, changes in expected prepayment speeds and other assumptions. The provision for credit losses also includes amounts related to off-balance sheet credit exposures and may include amounts related to accrued interest receivable and AFS debt securities. 
 40 

The following table presents the components of the provision for (recovery of) credit losses for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount related to funded portion of loans 9,091 30,877 46,719 62,667 Amount related to off-balance sheet credit exposures 157 2,172 (2,648) 5,687 Total provision for credit losses 
 9,248 33,049 44,071 68,354 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in qualitative overlays, changes in portfolio composition and characteristics, and updates to certain assumptions had the effect of increasing the provision, while the impact of improvements in the economic forecast partially offset that increase. For the nine month period, risk rating migration and an increase in specific reserve also contributed to the increase in the provision. 
 The provision for credit losses may be volatile and the level of the ACL may change materially from current levels. Future levels of the ACL could be significantly impacted, in either direction, by changes in factors such as, but not limited to, economic conditions or the economic outlook, the composition of the loan portfolio, the financial condition of our borrowers and collateral values. 
 The determination of the amount of the ACL is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. See Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses below for more information about how we determine the appropriate level of the ACL and about factors that impacted the ACL and provision for credit losses. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 The following table presents a comparison of the categories of non-interest income for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Deposit service charges and fees 5,016 5,189 15,238 15,705 Gain (loss) on investment securities: Net realized gain on sale of securities AFS 
 9 215 331 1,814 Net gain (loss) on marketable equity securities recognized in earnings 
 118 672 992 (12,483) Gain (loss) on investment securities, net 127 887 1,323 (10,669) Lease financing 6,368 16,531 23,448 42,159 Other non-interest income 11,377 5,117 33,941 22,551 22,888 27,724 73,950 69,746 
 The losses on marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were attributable to losses related to certain preferred equity investments. 
 The decrease in lease financing revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to a lower level of rental income as we have opportunistically sold some operating lease equipment in a strategic effort to reduce the size of the operating lease equipment portfolio. Expense related to the depreciation of operating lease equipment reflected a corresponding decrease over these comparative periods. 
 The increase in other non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflected increases in BOLI income, particularly as related to the BOLI assets supporting our deferred compensation plan, higher gains on sale of loans, higher loan-related and syndication fees and particularly for the comparative nine month periods, increased revenue from our customer derivative and commercial card businesses.

Non-Interest Expense 
 The following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Employee compensation and benefits 81,781 68,825 233,289 207,290 Occupancy and equipment 12,242 10,890 33,784 32,735 Deposit insurance expense 7,421 7,790 29,481 23,294 Professional fees 4,953 2,696 11,960 9,132 Technology 21,094 19,193 61,976 61,356 Depreciation of operating lease equipment 
 4,666 11,217 21,775 33,970 Other non-interest expense 32,425 26,479 89,263 77,311 Total non-interest expense 164,582 147,090 481,528 445,088 
 The most significant factor impacting the increases in employee compensation and benefits was the fluctuation in variable compensation expense, which was driven by an increase in the Company's stock price, impacting the value of liability-classified share-based awards as well as increases in certain other variable compensation accruals. The nine months ended September 30, 2023, also included reversal of expenses in the prior year for awards that did not vest. 
 The year-over-year increase in deposit insurance expense was primarily attributable to an additional 5.2 million related to an FDIC special assessment recorded during the first quarter of 2024. 
 The decline in depreciation of operating lease equipment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributed to a smaller operating lease equipment portfolio, corresponding to the decline in lease financing revenue. 
 Included in other non-interest expense are costs related to certain deposit customer rebate and commissions programs, which increased by 4.9 million and 16.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about income taxes. 
 
 Analysis of Financial Condition 
 The funding mix improved o ver the course of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we executed on our balance sheet transformation strategy. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total deposits grew by 1.3 billion, non-brokered deposits grew by 1.7 billion, including growth of 800 million in NIDDA to 27 of total deposits, while wholesale funding, including FHLB advances and brokered deposits, declined by 1.9 billion . 
 On the asset side of the balance sheet, while total loans declined by 235 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a change in portfolio composition. C I and CRE loans grew by 286 million and MWL grew by 139 million, while lower yielding residential loans strategically declined by 422 million, and franchise, equipment, and municipal finance declined by a combined 238 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average non-interest bearing demand deposits remained relatively stable as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, declining by 64 million. FHLB advances increased by 295 million due to intraday cash management activities, which is reflected in the temporarily elevated cash balances. Total loans declined by 230 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024; the CRE portfolio grew by 34 million and the MWL portfolio grew 33 million, while the C I portfolio declined by 112 million due to strategic exits and the timing of some unanticipated payoffs. Franchise, equipment, and municipal finance portfolios declined by 128 million, in aggregate, and residential loans declined by 57 million consistent with our balance sheet strategy.

 Our investment strategy is focused on ensuring adequate liquidity, maintaining a suitable balance of high credit quality, diverse assets, managing interest rate risk, and generating acceptable returns given our established risk parameters. We have sought to maintain liquidity by investing a significant portion of the portfolio in high quality liquid securities including U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency and sponsored enterprise securities. We have also invested in highly-rated structured products, including private-label commercial and residential MBS, collateralized loan obligations, single family real estate-backed securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities that, while somewhat less liquid, are generally pledgeable at either the FHLB or the FRB and provide us with attractive yields. Investment grade municipal securities provide liquidity and attractive tax-equivalent yields. We remain committed to keeping the duration of our securities portfolio short; relatively short effective portfolio duration helps mitigate interest rate risk. T he estimated effective duration of the investment portfolio was 1.74 years and the estimated weighted average life of the portfolio was 5.4 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 The investment securities AFS portfolio was in a net unrealized loss position of 338.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to a net unrealized loss position of 534.8 million at December 31, 2023, improving by 196.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 included 19.2 million of gross unrealized gains and 357.2 million of gross unrealized losses. Investment securities available for sale in unrealized loss positions at September 30, 2024 had an aggregate fair value of 6.1 billion. The unrealized losses resulted primarily from a sustained period of higher interest rates, and in some cases, wider spreads compared to the levels at which securities were purchased. None of the unrealized losses were attributable to credit loss impairments. 
 43 

The external ratings distribution of our AFS securities portfolio at the dates indicated is depicted in the charts below: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 
 
 We evaluate the credit quality of individual securities in the portfolio quarterly to determine whether we expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the investments in unrealized loss positions. This evaluation considers, but is not necessarily limited to, the following factors, the relative significance of which varies depending on the circumstances pertinent to each individual security: 
 Whether we intend to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis; 
 Whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis; 
 The extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost; 
 Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, a sector, an industry or geographic area; 
 Changes in the financial condition of the issuer or underlying loan obligors; 
 The payment structure and remaining payment terms of the security, including levels of subordination or over-collateralization; 
 Failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments; 
 Changes in external credit ratings; 
 Relevant market data; and 
 Estimated prepayments, defaults, and the value and performance of underlying collateral at the individual security level. 
 We regularly engage with bond managers to monitor trends in underlying collateral, including potential downgrades and subsequent cash flow diversions, liquidity, ratings migration, and any other relevant developments. 
 We do not intend to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions at September 30, 2024. Based on an assessment of our liquidity position and internal and regulatory guidelines for permissible investments and concentrations, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions prior to recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. The substantial majority of our investment securities are eligible to be pledged at either the FHLB or FRB. We have not sold, and do not anticipate the need to sell, securities in unrealized loss positions to generate liquidity.

 While for some securities, we have seen an increase in stress scenario losses over the last year, the level of subordination continues to provide more than sufficient coverage of stress scenario collateral losses, further supporting our determination that none of our securities are credit loss impaired. The scenario used to project stress scenario losses is generally calibrated to the level of stress experienced in the Great Financial Crisis. For further discussion of our analysis of impaired investment securities AFS for credit loss impairment, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 We use third-party pricing services to assist us in estimating the fair value of investment securities. We perform a variety of procedures to ensure that we have a thorough understanding of the methodologies and assumptions used by the pricing services including obtaining and reviewing written documentation of the methods and assumptions employed, conducting interviews with valuation desk personnel, and reviewing model results and detailed assumptions used to value selected securities as considered necessary. Our classification of prices within the fair value hierarchy is based on an evaluation of the nature of the significant assumptions impacting the valuation of each type of security in the portfolio. Our primary pricing services utilize observable inputs when available, and employ unobservable inputs and proprietary models only when observable inputs are not available. As a matter of course, the services validate prices by comparison to recent trading activity whenever such activity exists. Quotes obtained from the pricing services are typically non-binding. 
 Quarterly, prices obtained from primary third-party pricing services are validated by obtaining prices from an additional external source for most securities in the portfolio. We have established a robust price challenge process that includes a review by our treasury front office of all prices provided on a quarterly basis. Prices evidencing unexpected quarter over quarter fluctuations, deviations from our expectations based on recent observed trading activity and other information available in the marketplace that would impact the value of the security or deviations of primary prices from those provided by secondary sources beyond established parameters are challenged. Responses to the price challenges, which generally include specific information about inputs and assumptions incorporated in the valuation and their sources, are reviewed in detail. If considered necessary to resolve any discrepancies, a price will be obtained from additional independent valuation sources. We do not typically adjust the prices provided, other than through this established challenge process. 
 The majority of our investment securities are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified within level 1 of the hierarchy. 
 For additional disclosure related to the fair values of investment securities, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

The New York tri-state market encompasses approximately 23 of the office segment, with 169 million of exposure in Manhattan. As of September 30, 2024, the Manhattan office portfolio was approximately 95 occupied with 10 rent rollover expected in the next twelve months. The Florida office portfolio is predominantly suburban. 
 Office loans not secured by properties in Florida or the New York tri-state area comprised 20 , or 354 million of the segment, and exhibited no particular geographic concentration. Estimated rent rollover of the total office portfolio in the next 12 months is approximately 11 . 
 The construction portfolio includes an additional 85 million in office related exposure, 83 million of which is in New York. 
 Non-performing loans included 52 million of office exposure, including office exposure of 32 million in the construction portfolio, at September 30, 2024. Also see the section entitled "Asset Quality" below. 
 Commercial and Industrial 
 Commercial and industrial loans are typically made to small, middle market and larger corporate businesses and not-for-profit entities and include equipment loans, secured and unsecured working capital facilities, formula-based loans, subscription finance lines of credit, trade finance, SBA product offerings, business acquisition finance credit facilities, credit facilities to institutional real estate entities such as REITs and commercial real estate investment funds, and a small amount of commercial credit cards. These loans may be structured as term loans, typically with maturities of five to seven years, or revolving lines of credit which may have multi-year maturities. In addition to financing provided by Pinnacle, the Bank provides financing to state and local governmental entities generally within our primary geographic markets. The Bank makes loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate that typically have risk profiles more closely aligned with that of commercial and industrial loans than with other types of commercial real estate loans.

Through its commercial lending subsidiaries, Pinnacle and Bridge, the Bank provides franchise and equipment financing on a national basis using both loan and lease structures. Pinnacle provides essential-use equipment financing to state and local governmental entities directly and through vendor programs and alliances. Pinnacle offers a full array of financing structures including equipment lease purchase agreements and direct (private placement) bond re-fundings and loan agreements. Bridge has two divisions. The franchise finance division portfolio includes franchise acquisition, expansion and equipment financing facilities, typically extended to experienced operators in well-established concepts. The franchise finance portfolio is made up primarily of quick service restaurant and fitness concepts comprising 48 and 47 of the portfolio, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The equipment finance division portfolio includes primarily transportation equipment finance facilities utilizing a variety of loan and lease structures. Franchise and equipment finance have been strategically de-emphasized due to their current risk/return profile, including the lack of significant deposit business with these customers. We do not currently expect significant new loan originations in these segments. 
 
 Residential mortgages 
 The following table shows the composition of residential loans at the dates indicated (in thousands):

 The 1-4 single family residential loan portfolio, excluding government insured residential loans, is primarily comprised of prime jumbo loans purchased through established correspondent channels. 1-4 single family residential mortgage loans are primarily closed-end, first lien jumbo mortgages for the purchase or re-finance of owner occupied property. The loans have terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 984 million or 15 were secured by investor-owned properties. 
 The Company acquires non-performing FHA and VA insured mortgages from third party servicers who have exercised their right to purchase these loans out of GNMA securitizations upon default (collectively, "government insured pool buyout loans" or "buyout loans"). Buyout loans that re-perform, either through modification or self-cure, may be eligible for re-securitization. The Company and the servicer share in the economics of the sale of these loans into new securitizations. The balance of buyout loans totaled 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024. The Company is not the servicer of these loans.

 Bridge had exposure to the energy industry of 128 million at September 30, 2024. The majority of the energy exposure was in the operating lease equipment portfolio where energy exposure totaled 122 million, consisting primarily of railcars serving the petroleum industry. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 Commercial Loans 
 We have a robust credit risk management framework, an experienced team to lead the workout and recovery process for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios and a dedicated internal credit review function. Loan performance is monitored by our credit administration, portfolio management and workout and recovery departments. Risk ratings are updated continuously; generally, commercial relationships with balances in excess of defined thresholds are re-evaluated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. The defined thresholds range from 2 million to 3 million. Homogenous groups of smaller balance commercial loans may be monitored collectively. 
 51 

The credit quality and risk rating of commercial loans as well as our underwriting and portfolio management practices are regularly reviewed by our internal independent credit review department. 
 We believe internal risk rating is the best indicator of the credit quality of commercial loans. The Company utilizes a 16-grade internal asset risk classification system as part of its efforts to monitor and maintain commercial asset quality. The special mention rating is considered a transitional rating for loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that could result in deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date if not checked or corrected and that deserve management s close attention. These borrowers may exhibit declining cash flows or revenues or increasing leverage. Loans with well-defined credit weaknesses that may result in a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected are assigned a risk rating of substandard. These borrowers may exhibit payment defaults, inadequate cash flows from current operations, operating losses, increasing balance sheet leverage, project cost overruns, unreasonable construction delays, exhausted interest reserves, declining collateral values, frequent overdrafts or past due real estate taxes. Loans with weaknesses so severe that collection in full is highly questionable or improbable, but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors have not been charged off, are assigned an internal risk rating of doubtful. 
 The following table summarizes the Company's commercial credit exposure, based on internal risk rating, at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

 Total criticized and classified commercial loans increased by 322 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The majority of this increase was in the CRE office category. Criticized and classified CRE loans increased by 301 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 282 million of which was office exposure (including office related construction loans). This trend has moderated over the most recent quarter, with an increase of 6 million of criticized/classified CRE office exposure for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As expected in the current environment, there has been some further risk rating migration within the criticized and classified population, primarily within the CRE office category. Rent abatement periods, delays in completing build-out of leased space and in some cases lower occupancy levels have contributed to risk rating migration in the office portfolio. When office space is leased to new tenants, landlords frequently provide initial rent abatement periods. During these rent abatement periods, we do not include pro-forma rental payments to be made in the future under the terms of new leases in operating cash flows for the purposes of determining risk ratings.

 Residential Loans 
 Excluding government insured loans, our residential portfolio consists largely of performing jumbo mortgage loans purchased through established correspondent channels with FICO scores above 700, full documentation, current LTVs of 80 or less and are primarily owner-occupied. Loans with LTVs higher than 80 may be extended to selected credit-worthy borrowers. We perform due diligence on the purchased loans for credit, compliance, counterparty, payment history and property valuation. 
 We have a dedicated residential credit risk management function, and the residential portfolio is monitored by our internal credit review function. Residential mortgage loans are not individually risk rated. Delinquency status is the primary measure we use to monitor the credit quality of these loans. We also consider original LTV and most recently available FICO score to be significant indicators of credit quality for the 1-4 single family residential portfolio, excluding government insured residential loans. 
 The following charts present information about the 1-4 single family residential portfolio, excluding government insured loans, by FICO distribution, LTV distribution and vintage at September 30, 2024:

The following graph presents delinquency trends for residential loans, excluding government insured residential loans, over the periods indicated (in millions): 
 Residential Delinquencies 

FICO scores are generally updated semi-annually and were most recently updated in the third quarter of 2024. LTVs are typically based on valuation at origination since we do not routinely update residential appraisals. 
 At September 30, 2024, the majority of the 1-4 single family residential loan portfolio, excluding government insured residential loans, was owner-occupied, with 80 primary residence, 5 second homes and 15 investment properties. 
 Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements presents additional information about key credit quality indicators and delinquency status of the loan portfolio. 
 
 Stress Testing Results 
 The majority of our commercial portfolio is subject to quarterly stress test analysis. We continually re-evaluate our stress testing framework and adapt it to evolving macro-economic conditions, as necessary. On an annual basis, we also run a rigorous stress test of our entire balance sheet incorporating the FRB's severely adverse CCAR scenario as well as additional idiosyncratic scenarios reflective of evolving macro-economic themes. The most recent stress test incorporating the FRB's CCAR severely adverse scenario was performed during the second quarter of 2024, based on the December 31, 2023 balance sheet.

 Operating Lease Equipment, net 
 There were no operating leases internally risk rated substandard or worse at September 30, 2024. On a quarterly basis, management performs an impairment analysis on assets with indicators of potential impairment. Potential impairment indicators include evidence of changes in residual value, macro-economic conditions, an extended period of time off-lease, criticized or classified status, or management's intention to sell the asset at an amount potentially below its carrying value. There were no impairment charges recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 (2) Annualized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the six months ended June 30, 2024. 
 The increase in non-accrual loans during the three months ended was primarily related to two commercial and industrial loans. Contractually delinquent government insured residential loans are typically GNMA early buyout loans and are excluded from non-performing loans as defined in the table above due to their government guarantee. The carrying value of such loans contractually delinquent by 90 days or more was 229 million, 225 million, and 277 million at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 The following graph presents the trend in non-performing loans by portfolio segment over the periods indicated (in millions): 
 
 Commercial loans are placed on non-accrual status when (i) management has determined that full repayment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt, or (ii) the loan is past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Residential loans, other than government insured pool buyout loans, are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are 60 days past due. Additionally, certain residential loans not contractually delinquent but in forbearance may be placed on non-accrual status at management's discretion. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income. Commercial loans are returned to accrual status only after all past due principal and interest has been collected and full repayment of remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured. Residential loans are generally returned to accrual status when less than 60 days past due. Past due status of loans is determined based on the contractual next payment due date. Loans less than 30 days past due are reported as current. 
 Loss Mitigation Strategies 
 Criticized or classified commercial loans in excess of certain thresholds are reviewed quarterly by the Criticized Asset Committee, which evaluates the appropriate strategy for collection to mitigate the amount of credit losses and considers the appropriate risk rating for these loans. Criticized asset reports for each relationship are presented by the assigned relationship manager and credit officer to the Criticized Asset Committee until such time as the relationships are returned to a satisfactory credit risk rating or otherwise resolved. The Criticized Asset Committee may require the transfer of a loan to our workout and recovery department, which is tasked to effectively manage the loan with the goal of minimizing losses and expenses associated with restructure, collection and/or liquidation of collateral. Commercial loans with a risk rating of substandard, loans on non-accrual status, and assets classified as OREO or repossessed assets are usually transferred to workout and recovery. Oversight of the workout and recovery department is provided by the Criticized Asset Committee. 
 Our servicers evaluate each residential loan in default to determine the most effective loss mitigation strategy, which may be modification, short sale, or foreclosure, and pursue the alternative most suitable to the consumer and to mitigate losses to the Bank.

Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL is management's estimate of the amount of expected credit losses over the life of the loan portfolio, or the amount of amortized cost basis not expected to be collected, at the balance sheet date. This estimate encompasses information about historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Determining the amount of the ACL is complex and requires extensive judgment by management about matters that are inherently uncertain. Given a level of continued uncertainty about the general economy, evolving dynamics in some segments of the commercial real estate market, particularly the office sector, the complexity of the ACL estimate and level of management judgment required, we believe it is possible that the ACL estimate could change, potentially materially, in future periods. If commercial real estate market dynamics in our primary markets worsen beyond our current expectations, the ACL and the provision for credit losses will increase in the future. Changes in the ACL may result from changes in current economic conditions including but not limited to unanticipated changes in interest rates or inflationary pressures, changes in our economic forecast, loan portfolio composition, commercial and residential real estate market dynamics and other circumstances not currently known to us that may impact the financial condition and operations of our borrowers, among other factors. 
 Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for groups of loans that share similar risk characteristics. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans such as collateral dependent loans, expected credit losses are estimated on an individual basis. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments, generally excluding expected extensions, renewals, and modifications. 
 For the substantial majority of portfolio segments and subsegments, including residential loans other than government insured loans, and most commercial and commercial real estate loans, expected losses are estimated using econometric models. The models employ a factor based methodology, leveraging data sets containing extensive historical loss and recovery information by industry, geography, product type, collateral type and obligor characteristics, to estimate PD and LGD. Measures of PD for commercial loans incorporate current conditions through market cycle or credit cycle adjustments. For residential loans, the models consider FICO and adjusted LTVs. PDs and LGDs are then conditioned on the reasonable and supportable economic forecast. Projected PDs and LGDs, determined based on pool level characteristics, are applied to estimated exposure at default, considering the contractual term and payment structure of loans, adjusted for expected prepayments, to generate estimates of expected loss. For criticized or classified loans, PDs are adjusted to benchmark PDs established for each risk rating. The ACL estimate incorporates a reasonable and supportable economic forecast through the use of externally developed macroeconomic scenarios applied in the models. 
 A single economic scenario or a probability weighted blend of economic scenarios may be used. The models ingest numerous national, regional and MSA level variables and data points. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we used a combination of weighted third-party provided economic scenarios in calculating the quantitative portion of the ACL. Each of these externally provided scenarios in fact represents the result of a probability weighting of thousands of individual scenario paths. 
 See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detailed information about our ACL methodology and related accounting policies.

 Factors contributing to the change in the ACL during the three months ended September 30, 2024, are depicted in the chart below (dollars in millions): 
 
 Changes in the ACL during the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 As depicted in the chart above, the most significant drivers of the increase in the ACL from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024, were (i) an increase in qualitative overlays; (ii) updates to certain assumptions; and (iii) changes in portfolio composition and characteristics; partially offset by (i) an improvement in the economic forecast and (ii) net charge-offs. At September 30, 2024, the ratio of the ACL to loans was 0.94 compared to 0.92 at June 30, 2024 and 0.82 at December 31, 2023. The ACL to loans ratio for commercial portfolio sub-segments including C I, CRE, and franchise and equipment finance was 1.41 and 1.42 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, up from 1.29 at December 31, 2023. The ACL to loans ratio for CRE office loans was 2.20 at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.47 and 1.18 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decline in the ACL to loans ratio for the CRE office category for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decline in the specific reserve for one office loan for which an updated 
 61 

appraisal reflected a more favorable valuation than our previous estimate. Further discussion of changes in the ACL for select portfolio sub-segments follows: 
 The ACL for the CRE portfolio sub-segment decreased by 8.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.17 to 1.02 of loans. The most significant reasons for the decrease in the ACL for this segment were decreases in specific reserves, and risk rating migrations, offset by an increase in the qualitative overlay. 
 The ACL for the commercial and industrial sub-segment, including owner-occupied commercial real estate, increased by 8.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.57 to 1.68 of loans. The most significant reasons for the increase in the ACL for this segment were (i) increases in specific reserves; and (ii) an increase in the qualitative overlay; partially offset by (i) an improvement in the economic forecast; and (ii) net charge-offs. 
 The ACL for the franchise and equipment finance sub-segment decreased by 2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.93 to 1.20 of loans. This decline is primarily due to a charge-off. 
 The ACL for the residential segment increased by 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, mainly attributable to updated modeling assumptions about minimum levels of loss given default. 
 The estimate of the ACL at September 30, 2024, was informed by forecasted economic scenarios published in September 2024, a wide variety of additional economic data, information about borrower financial condition and collateral values, and other relevant information. The quantitative portion of the ACL at September 30, 2024, was modeled using a weighting of baseline, downside and upside third-party economic scenarios, with the highest weighting ascribed to the baseline scenario and lower weightings ascribed equally to the downside and upside scenarios. 
 Some of the high level data points informing the baseline scenario, which was the scenario most heavily weighted, used in estimating the quantitative portion of the ACL at September 30, 2024, included: 
 Labor market assumptions, which reflected national unemployment peaking at 4.3 and 
 Annualized growth in national GDP troughing at 1.8 in the baseline. 
 The above unemployment and GDP growth assumptions are provided to give a high level overview of the nature and severity of the baseline economic forecast scenario used in estimating the ACL. Numerous additional variables and assumptions not explicitly stated, including but not limited to detailed commercial and residential property forecasts, projected stock market volatility indices and a variety of additional assumptions about market interest rates and spreads also contributed to the overall impact economic conditions and the economic forecast had on the ACL estimate. Furthermore, while the variables presented above are at the national level, many of the economic variables are regionalized at the market and submarket level in the models. 
 For additional information about the ACL, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Deposits 
 The Company has a diverse deposit book by industry sector. Approximately 64 of our total deposits were commercial or municipal deposits at September 30, 2024. 
 The following table presents information about the Company's insured and collateralized deposits as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Total deposits 27,856,225 Estimated amount of uninsured deposits

 The estimated amount of uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was 13.6 billion and 12.4 billion, respectively. Collateralized and affiliate deposits are included in these amounts. Time deposit accounts with balances of 250,000 or more totaled 880 million and 941 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table shows scheduled maturities of estimated uninsured time deposits as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

 For additional information about Deposits, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Borrowings 
 In addition to deposits, we utilize FHLB advances as a funding source; the advances provide us with additional flexibility in managing both term and cost of funding and in managing interest rate risk. FHLB advances are secured by qualifying residential first mortgage and commercial real estate loans and MBS. The following table presents information about the contractual balance and maturities of outstanding FHLB advances, as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Amount Weighted Average Rate Maturing in: 2024 - One month or less

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity involves our ability to generate adequate funds to support planned interest earning asset growth, meet deposit withdrawal and credit line usage requests in both normal operating and stressed environments, maintain reserve requirements, conduct routine operations, pay dividends, service outstanding debt and meet other contractual obligations. 
 BankUnited's ongoing liquidity needs have historically been met primarily by cash flows from operations, deposit growth, the investment portfolio, its amortizing loan portfolio and FHLB advances. FRB discount window capacity, repurchase agreement capacity and a letter of credit with the FHLB provide additional sources of contingent liquidity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 248 million and 594 million, respectively. The most significant contributor to the period over period decline in net cash provided by operating activities was a decline in cash proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale, due to less loan sale activity. 
 Same day available liquidity inc ludes cash, secured funding such as borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve, and unencumbered securities. Additional sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, wholesale deposits, cash flow from the Bank's amortizing securities and loan portfolios, and the sale of investment securities. Management also has the ability to exert substantial control over the rate and timing of loan production, and resultant requirements for liquidity to fund new loans. 
 
 64 

The following chart presents the components of same day available liquidity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions): 
 Same Day Available Liquidity 
 
 The increase in same day available liquidity as compared to December 31, 2023 reflected the decline in outstanding FHLB advances, increasing FHLB capacity. At September 30, 2024, the ratio of estimated insured and collateralized deposits to total deposits was 63 , compared to 66 at December 31, 2023, and the ratio of available liquidity to estimated uninsured, uncollateralized deposits was 147 compared to 152 at December 31, 2023. The decline in brokered deposits, which are generally insured, as a portion of total deposits contributed to the decline in these ratios. As a commercially focused bank, due to the inherent nature of commercial deposits, a significant portion of our deposits are uninsured. We continue to market and educate our customers about products that enable them to obtain FDIC insurance on certain deposits exceeding the standard single depositor insurance limit, have implemented single depositor concentration limits and reduced or eliminated exposure to sectors or depositors that evidenced higher volatility following the events of early 2023. 
 Our ALM policy establishes limits or operating risk thresholds for a number of measures of liquidity which are monitored at least monthly by the ALCO and quarterly by the Board of Directors. Some of the measures currently used to dimension liquidity risk and manage liquidity are the ratio of available liquidity to uninsured/non-collateralized deposits, the ratio of wholesale funding to total assets, the ratio of available operational liquidity (which excludes availability at the FRB) to volatile liabilities, a liquidity stress test coverage ratio, the loan to deposit ratio, a one-year liquidity ratio, a measure of available on-balance sheet liquidity, the ratio of FHLB advances to total assets, large depositor concentrations and the ratio of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits, which is reflective of the quality and cost, rather than the quantity, of available liquidity. We also have single depositor relationship limits.

 As a holding company, BankUnited, Inc. is a corporation separate and apart from its banking subsidiary, and therefore, provides for its own liquidity. BankUnited, Inc. s main sources of funds include management fees and dividends from the Bank, access to capital markets and, to a lesser extent, its own securities portfolio. There are regulatory limitations that may affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to BankUnited, Inc. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing near-term cash obligations. 
 
 Capital 
 Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations setting forth a five-tier system for measuring the capital adequacy of the financial institutions they supervise. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank had capital levels that exceeded both the regulatory well-capitalized guidelines and all internal capital ratio targets. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company elected the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. 
 We have an active shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that allows the Company to periodically offer and sell in one or more offerings, individually or in any combination, our common stock, preferred stock and other non-equity securities. The shelf registration provides us with flexibility in issuing capital instruments and enables us to more readily access the capital markets as needed to pursue future growth opportunities and to ensure continued compliance with regulatory capital requirements. Our ability to issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration is subject to market conditions.

Interest Rate Risk 
 A principal component of the Company s risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, or market risk, is interest rate risk, including the risk that assets and liabilities with similar re-pricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree. A primary objective of the Company s asset/liability management activities is to maximize net interest income, while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk. The ALCO is responsible for establishing policies to manage exposure to interest rate risk, and to ensure procedures are established to monitor compliance with these policies. The policies established by the ALCO are approved at least annually by the Board of Directors or its Risk Committee. 
 Management believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides the most meaningful measure of interest rate risk. Income simulation analysis is designed to capture not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice, but also the probability that they will do so. Income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items, and projects their behavior over an extended period of time. Finally, income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates, but also of proposed strategies for responding to them. Simulation of changes in EVE in various interest rate environments is also a meaningful measure of interest rate risk. 
 Net Interest Income Simulation 
 The income simulation model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income over twelve and twenty-four month periods in a most likely rate scenario based on a consensus forward curve versus net interest income in alternative rate scenarios. Management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to changes in the interest rate environment, the economic climate and observed customer behavior. Currently, our interest rate risk management policy framework is based on modeling instantaneous rate shocks to a static balance sheet, assuming that maturing instruments are replaced with like instruments at forward rates, of plus and minus 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point parallel shifts. In lower interest rate environments, we may not model more extreme declining rate scenarios and in certain macro-environments, we may model shocks of more than 400 basis points. Our ALM policy has established limits for the plus and minus 100 and 200 basis points shock scenarios. We also model a variety of dynamic balance sheet scenarios, various yield curve slopes, non-parallel shifts and alternative depositor behavior, beta and decay assumptions. We continually evaluate the scenarios being modeled with a view toward adapting them to changing economic conditions, expectations and trends. 
 The following table presents the impact on forecasted net interest income compared to a "most likely" scenario, based on the consensus forward curve, in static balance sheet, parallel rate shock scenarios of plus and minus 100 and 200 basis points at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Down 200 Down 100 Plus 100 Plus 200 Policy Limits: 
 In year 1 (12) (8) (8) (12) In year 2 (15) (11) (11) (15) Model Results at September 30, 2024 - increase (decrease) 
 In year 1 (6.3) (2.7) 2.2 4.5 In year 2 (6.8) (2.9) 2.1 3.8 Model Results at December 31, 2023 - increase (decrease) 
 In year 1 (4.7) (1.6) 1.0 2.1 In year 2 (6.0) (2.3) 1.5 2.0 
 EVE Simulation 
 The following table illustrates the modeled change in EVE in the indicated scenarios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Down 200 Down 100 Plus 100 Plus 200 Policy Limits 
 (20.0) (10.0) (10.0) (20.0) Model Results at September 30, 2024 - increase (decrease): 
 15.0 9.7 (7.6) (14.9) Model Results at December 31, 2023 - increase (decrease): 
 15.2 9.5 (8.8) (17.4) 
 All of the modeled results at September 30, 2024, are within ALM policy limits.

The Company uses many assumptions in estimating the impact of changes in interest rates on forecasted net interest income and EVE. Actual results may not be similar to the Company's projections due to many factors including but not limited to the timing and frequency of market rate changes, market conditions, unanticipated changes in depositor behavior and loan prepayment speeds, the shape of the yield curve, changes in balance sheet composition and the Company's actions in response to changing external and balance sheet dynamics. Some of the more significant assumptions used by the Company in estimating the impact of changes in interest rates on forecasted net interest income and EVE at September 30, 2024 were: 
 Prepayment speeds for loans, with CPRs ranging from 7 to 12 depending on loan characteristics and the magnitude of the modeled rate shock; 
 Prepayment speeds for investment securities, with CPRs ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 depending on individual security collateral and characteristics and the magnitude of the modeled rate shock; 
 Deposit decay rates ranging between 15 and 20 ; 
 Overall non-maturity interest bearing deposit beta of 75 ; 
 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 Management continually evaluates a variety of hedging strategies that are available to manage interest rate risk.. 
 Interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow or fair value hedging instruments are tools we use to manage interest rate risk. These derivative instruments are used to mitigate exposure to changes in interest cash flows on variable rate liabilities and to changes in the fair value of fixed rate financial instruments, in each case caused by fluctuations in benchmark interest rates, as well as to manage duration of liabilities. 
 The following table provides information about the Company's derivatives designated as hedging instruments as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Weighted Average Pay Rate / Strike Price Weighted Average Receive Rate / Strike Price Weighted Average Remaining Life in Years Notional Amount Hedged Item Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges: Pay-fixed interest rate swaps Variability of interest cash flows on variable rate borrowings 2,580,000 3.40 Daily SOFR 1.4 Pay-fixed interest rate swaps Variability of interest cash flows on variable rate liabilities 250,000 1.38 Fed Funds Effective Rate 0.3 Pay-variable interest rate swaps Variability of interest cash flows on variable rate loans 200,000 Term SOFR 3.72 1.6 Interest rate caps purchased, indexed to Fed Funds effective rate Variability of interest cash flows on variable rate liabilities 200,000 0.88 0.7 Interest rate collar, indexed to 1-month SOFR (1) 
 Variability of interest cash flows on variable rate loans 125,000 5.58 1.50 1.9 Derivatives designated as fair value hedges: Pay-fixed interest rate swaps Variability of fair value of fixed rate loans 50,000 1.98 Daily SOFR 0.2 3,405,000 
 
 (1) The interest rate collar consists of a combination of zero-premium interest rate options. The Company sold a pay-variable cap with a strike price of 5.58 ; sold a 0 floor; and purchased a receive-variable floor with a strike price of 1.50 . 
 In addition to derivative instruments, the Company has issued callable CDs to hedge interest rate risk in a falling rate environment; the amount of such instruments outstanding at September 30, 2024, was 494 million. The short duration of our AFS investment portfolio (1.73 at September 30, 2024) also provides a natural offset from an interest rate risk perspective to the longer duration of the residential mortgage portfolio. 
 See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is relevant to understanding the capital position and performance of the Company. Disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure also provides a meaningful basis for comparison to other financial institutions as it is a metric commonly used in the banking industry. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measurement of tangible book value per common share to the comparable GAAP financial measurement of book value per common share at the dates indicated (in thousands, except share and per share data): 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Total stockholders equity 2,807,804 2,699,348 Less: goodwill and other intangible assets 77,637 77,637 Tangible stockholders equity 2,730,167 2,621,711 Common shares issued and outstanding 74,749,012 74,758,609 Book value per common share 37.56 36.11 Tangible book value per common share 36.52 35.07
