CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current or prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, would, will, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. 
 The following factors and factors listed under Risk Factors in this report and other documents Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial position. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 
 uncertainty surrounding the financial stability of the United States, Europe and China; 

the ability of our investment adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

potential fluctuation in quarterly operating results; 

potential impact of economic recessions or downturns; 

adverse developments in the credit markets; 

regulations governing our operation as a business development company; 

operation in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities; 

risks associated with inflation and the current interest rate environment; 

changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income; 

the impact of changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), or other benchmark rate on our operating results; 

financing investments with borrowed money; 

potential adverse effects of price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets; 

lack of liquidity in investments; 

the outcome and impact of any litigation; 

the timing, form and amount of any dividend distributions; 

risks regarding distributions; 

potential adverse effects of new or modified laws and regulations; 

potential resignation of the Adviser and or the Administrator; 

uncertainty as to the value of certain portfolio investments; 

defaults by portfolio companies; 

our ability to successfully complete and integrate any acquisitions; 

risks associated with original issue discount OID and payment-in-kind PIK interest income; 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly; 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based upon are reasonable, some of those assumptions may be based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information 
 2 

contained herein, except as required by applicable law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company.

The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of its ownership of certain portfolio investments.

No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Administrator or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Administrator (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Administrator or its affiliates to the Company s accounting professionals, legal counsel, and compliance professionals who spend time on such related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company). The allocable portion of the compensation for these officers and other professionals are included in the administration expenses paid to the

of the Company s gross assets, including assets acquired through the incurrence of debt but excluding any cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper maturing within one year of purchase.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred management fees of and , of which a nd , re spectively, were waived. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management fees of and , respectively, were unpaid. 	 Incentive Fee per Investment Advisory Agreement Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee consists of two parts: The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and (a) equals of the excess of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, over a preferred return of per quarter annualized) (the Hurdle ), and a catch-up feature until the Adviser has received of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter up to (the Catch-up ), and (b) of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the Catch-up. The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year at a rate of of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the Company s inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee. On February 22, 2021, the Adviser notified the Board of Directors of its intent to voluntarily waive income incentive fees to the extent net investment income, excluding the effect of the GAAP incentive fee, falls short of the regular declared dividend on a full dollar basis. The waiver became effective on July 31, 2021 and, pursuant to an extension of the waiver announced on October 4, 2022, continued through December 31, 2023. The Adviser has also voluntarily waived its right to receive the income incentive fees attributable to the investment income accrued by the Company as a result of its investments in GACP II LP, WhiteHawk III Onshore Fund LP and Freeport Financial SBIC Fund LP.

GAAP Incentive Fee on Cumulative Unrealized Capital Appreciation The Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the incentive fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an incentive fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the incentive fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an incentive fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual incentive fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded capital gains incentive fees on unrealized capital appreciation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , capital gains incentive fees remain outstanding.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt and equity securities are primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), revenue, comparable multiples and market discount rates. The Company typically uses comparable EBITDA or revenue multiples on its equity securities to determine the fair value of investments. The Company uses discount rates for debt securities to determine if the effective yield on a debt security is commensurate with the market yields for that type of debt security. The significant unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flow approach is the discount rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. Increases and decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease and increase in the fair value, respectively. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. 

 The significant unobservable inputs used in the market multiple approach are the multiples of similar companies EBITDA, revenue and comparable market transactions. Increases and decreases in market EBITDA multiples and revenue would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value, respectively. 

 The recovery rate represents the extent to which proceeds can be recovered. An increase/decrease in the recovery rate would result in an increase/decrease, respectively, in the fair value. The transaction precedent represents an observable transaction or a pending event for the investment.

per share (the FCRD Common Stock ), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares held by subsidiaries of FCRD or held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or Acquisition Sub Cancelled Shares )) had their shares of FCRD Common Stock converted to the right to receive, in the aggregate, approximately (1) in cash payable by the Company (the CCAP Cash Consideration ), (2) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Aggregate Share Consideration and, together with the CCAP Cash Consideration, the CCAP Aggregate Merger Consideration and (3) in cash payable by the Adviser (the CCAP Adviser Cash Consideration ), subject to adjustments for cash payable in lieu of fractional shares. With respect to the CCAP Aggregate Merger Consideration, record holders of shares of FCRD Common Stock were entitled, with respect to all or any portion of the shares of FCRD Common Stock held as of the Effective Time, to make an election to receive payment for their shares of FCRD Common Stock in cash (an Election ), subject to the conditions of and certain adjustment mechanisms set forth in the Merger Agreement. Any record holder of shares of FCRD Common Stock who did not validly make an Election was deemed to have elected to receive shares of the Company s common stock with respect to the CCAP Aggregate Merger Consideration as payment for their shares of FCRD Common Stock. Each share of FCRD Common Stock (other than a Cancelled Share) with respect to which an Election was effectively made, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, and not properly revoked or lost was treated as an Electing Share and each share of FCRD Common Stock (other than a Cancelled Share) with respect to which an Election was not properly made or such Election was properly revoked was treated as a Non-Electing Share. Applying the adjustment mechanisms in the Merger Agreement among all stockholders who hold Electing Shares, pro rata based on the aggregate number of Electing Shares held by each such stockholder, each Electing Share was converted into the right to receive (1) with respect to its share of the CCAP Aggregate Merger Consideration, approximately in cash and approximately shares of the Company s common stock (subject to adjustments for cash payable in lieu of fractional shares) and (2) with respect to its share of the CCAP Adviser Cash Consideration, approximately in cash. Each Non-Electing Share was converted into the right to receive (1) with respect to its share of the CCAP Aggregate Merger Consideration, approximately shares of the the Company s common stock and (2) with respect to its share of the CCAP Adviser Cash Consideration, approximately in cash (subject to adjustments for cash payable in lieu of fractional shares). In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement, Sun Life, which owns a majority interest in the Adviser, has committed to provide secondary market support and will over time purchase up to of the combined company s common stock via a share purchase program. As of September 30, 2024, Sun Life purchased approximately o f the Company's common stock via a share purchase program. The FCRD Acquisition was accounted as an asset acquisition because the set of acquired assets did not constitute a business. Accordingly, the fair value of the merger consideration paid by the Company was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the date of acquisition and did not give rise to goodwill. Since the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the fair value of the merger consideration paid by the Company, the Company recognized a deemed contribution from the Adviser equal to the amount by which the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the merger consideration paid directly by the Company.

I TEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements set forth on page 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In this report, we, us, our and Company refer to Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland. We were listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on February 3, 2020. We have elected to be treated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 1940 Act ). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code ). As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. 
 We are managed by Crescent Cap Advisors, LLC (the Adviser ), an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. CCAP Administration, LLC (the Administrator ), provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Our management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Adviser and Administrator along with our Board. The Adviser directs and executes our investment operations and capital raising activities subject to oversight from the Board, which sets our broad policies. The Board has delegated investment management of our investment assets to the Adviser. The Board consists of six directors, five of whom are independent. 
 Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. We invest primarily in secured debt (including first lien, unitranche first lien and second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments i.e. , private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated over-the-counter market i.e. , broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans to complement our private credit transactions. 
 First lien investments are senior loans on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer s capital structure that have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. 
 Unitranche first lien investments are loans that may extend deeper in a company s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different lenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, we may find another lender to provide the first out portion of such loan and retain the last out portion of such loan, in which case, the first out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the last out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the last out portion earns a higher interest rate. 
 Second lien investments are loans with a second priority lien on all existing and future assets of the portfolio company. The security interest ranks below the security interests of any first lien and unitranche first lien lenders in those assets. 
 Unsecured debt investments are loans that generally rank senior to a borrower s equity securities and junior in right of payment to such borrower s other senior indebtedness. 
 
 94 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed herein. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distribution Policy, and Income Taxes. 
 COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 We expect our investment activity to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us, the level of merger and acquisition activity for middle-market companies, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to such companies and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors. 
 We may not invest in any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the investments are made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 The Investment Adviser 
 Our investment activities are managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has entered into a resource sharing agreement with Crescent Capital Group LP Crescent ), pursuant to which Crescent provides the Adviser with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Adviser s investment committee) and access to Crescent s resources so as to enable the Adviser to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the resource sharing agreement, the Adviser intends to capitalize on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Crescent s investment professionals. On January 5, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures, Sun Life acquired a majority interest in Crescent (the Sun Life Transaction ). There were no changes to our investment objective, strategies and process or to the Crescent team responsible for the investment operations as a result of the Sun Life Transaction. 
 95 

Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. We also generate revenue in the form of commitment or origination fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into income over the life of the loan using the effective yield method. 
 Dividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. 
 We may receive other income, which may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, underwriting, and arranger fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees and incentive fees to the Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as amended, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement with our Administrator (the Administration Agreement ), operating costs associated with our sub-administration agreement and other operating costs described below. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 
 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

fidelity bond, directors and officers liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 

independent directors fees and expenses; 

administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, rent and the allocable portion of the cost of certain professional services provided to us, including but not limited to, our accounting professionals, our legal counsel and compliance professionals); 

U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; 

fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments; 

out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees; 

brokerage commissions; 

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; 

debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. 

We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 96 

Leverage 
 Our financing facilities allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. 
 In accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with stockholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200 , as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser s and our Board s assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. 
 PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ACTIVITY 
 We seek to create a broad and diversified portfolio that generally includes senior secured first lien, unitranche, senior secured second lien, unsecured loans and minority equity securities of U.S. middle market companies. The size of our individual investments varies proportionately with the size of our capital base. We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity.

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had fourteen investments across five portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 1.7 and 0.9 of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had seventeen investments across nine portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 2.0 and 1.9 of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. The remaining debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies; 

contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the industry; and 

attendance and participation in board meetings. 

As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 
 1. Involves the least amount of risk relative to cost or amortized cost. Investment performance is above expectations since origination or acquisition. Trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include financial performance or a potential exit. 

2. Involves a level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The investment is generally performing as expected, and the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment are neutral to favorable relative to the time of origination or acquisition. New investments are generally assigned a rating of 2 at origination or acquisition. 

3. Indicates an investment performing below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment have increased since origination or acquisition. For debt investments, borrowers are more likely than not in compliance with debt covenants and loan payments are generally not past due. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. 

4. Indicates an investment performing materially below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment have increased materially since origination or acquisition. For debt investments, borrowers may be out of compliance with debt covenants and loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Non-accrual status is strongly considered for debt investments rated 4. 

5. Indicates an investment performing substantially below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment have substantially increased since origination or acquisition. We do not expect to recover our initial cost basis from investments rated 5. Debt investments with an investment rating of 5 are generally in payment and/or covenant default and are on non-accrual status. 

The following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company s business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.

 Dividend income decreased from 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower dividend income from portfolio companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.8 million and 0.4 million of other income related to one-time arranger fees, respectively. 
 Interest income, which includes amortization of upfront fees, increased from 123.5 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 139.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to a rise in benchmark rates and one-time income. Included in interest from investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are 3.2 million and 0.7 million of accelerated accretion of OID related to paydown activity, respectively. 
 Dividend income decreased from 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower dividend income from portfolio companies.

Interest and other debt financing costs 
 Interest and other debt financing costs include interest, amortization of deferred financing costs including upfront commitment fees and unused fees on our credit facilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 interest and other debt financing costs were 16.1 million and 15.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 interest and other debt financing costs were 47.6 million and 43.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest and other debt financing costs was due to a higher weighted average debt outstanding and higher weighted average cost of debt related to a rise in benchmark rates. 
 Base Management Fees 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred management fees of 5.1 million and 5.1 million, respectively, of which 0.0 million and 0.1 million, respectively, were waived. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we incurred management fees of 15.1 million and 14.5 million, respectively, of which 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in net management fees was driven by growing assets under management. 
 Incentive Fees 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred income based incentive fees of 5.0 million and 4.6 million, of which 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, were waived. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred income based incentive fees of 14.5 million and 12.6 million, of which 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in net incentive fees was driven by higher pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 Professional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses 
 Professional fees generally include expenses from independent auditors, tax advisors, legal counsel and third party valuation agents. Other general and administrative expenses generally include overhead and staffing costs allocated from the Administrator, insurance premiums, sub-administration expenses and miscellaneous administrative costs associated with our operations and investment activity. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, professional fees were 0.6 million and 0.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, professional fees were 1.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively. The increase is related to higher costs related to regulatory compliance. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other general and administrative expenses were 0.5 million and 0.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other general and administrative expenses were 1.9 million and 2.1 million, respectively. 
 101 

Income and Excise Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we expensed income and excise taxes of 0.7 million and 0.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we expensed income and excise taxes of 1.5 million and 0.9 million, respectively, due to higher undistributed taxable income balance. Net Investment Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net investment income was 23.5 million or 0.64 per share and 21.8 million or 0.59 per share, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net investment income was 68.5 million or 1.85 per share and 59.8 million or 1.68 per share, respectively. The increase in the per share net investment income was due to higher investment income earned year to date. 
 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses 
 We value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:

Hedging 
 We may, but are not required to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks. Generally, we do not intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which are in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may include the use of various instruments, including futures, options and forward contracts. We bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our average U.S. Dollar notional exposure, calculated daily on a weighted average based on the duration of each forward contract, to foreign currency forward contracts were 77.5 million and 99.4 million, respectively. 
 102 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments; (2) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser); (3) debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and (4) cash distributions to the holders of our common stock. We expect to generate additional liquidity from (1) future offerings of securities, (2) future borrowings and (3) cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 37.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents and 317.0 million of undrawn capacity on our senior revolving credit and special purpose vehicle asset facilities, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2024, the undrawn capacity under our facilities and cash and cash equivalents were in excess of our unfunded commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. In addition, we were in compliance with all the financial covenant requirements of our credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. However, an increase in realized losses or unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the rising rate environment and the potential for a recession increase the risk of breaching the relevant covenants requirements. Any breach of these requirements may adversely affect the access to sufficient debt and equity capital. 
 Capital Share Activity 
 In connection with the FCRD Acquisition, we issued 6,174,187 shares as part of the consideration paid for net assets acquired. 

(2) 

The combined weighted average interest rate of the aggregate borrowings outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.23 and 6.96 , respectively. The combined weighted average debt of the aggregate borrowings outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 878.9 million and 825.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average cost of debt was 6.59 and 7.02 , respectively.

SPV Asset Facility 
 On March 28, 2016, Crescent Capital BDC Funding, LLC CCAP SPV ), a wholly owned subsidiary of CCAP, entered into a loan and security agreement, as amended from time to time (the SPV Asset Facility ), with us as the collateral manager, seller and equity holder, CCAP SPV as the borrower, the banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo ), as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender. We consolidate CCAP SPV in our consolidated financial statements and no gain or loss is recognized from the transfer of assets to and from CCAP SPV. 
 
 On May 31, 2024, CCAP SPV entered into the Seventh Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement. The amendment, among other things, (a) extended the last day of the reinvestment period to May 31, 2027, and the stated maturity date to May 31, 2029 and (b) reduced the spread from 2.75 to 2.45 . 
 The maximum commitment amount under the SPV Asset Facility is 500.0 million, and may be increased with the consent of Wells Fargo or reduced upon our request. Proceeds of the advances under the SPV Asset Facility may be used to acquire portfolio investments, to make distributions to us in accordance with the SPV Asset Facility, and to pay related expenses. The maturity date is the earlier of (a) the date the borrower voluntarily reduces the commitments to zero, (b) May 31, 2029 and (c) the date upon which Wells Fargo declares the obligations due and payable after the occurrence of an Event of Default. Borrowings under the SPV Asset Facility bear interest at daily simple SOFR plus a 2.45 margin with no floor. We pay unused facility fees of 0.50 per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the SPV Asset Facility. The unused facility fee rate may vary based on the utilization. The SPV Asset Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature. 
 The facility size is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the amount of CCAP SPV s assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage test and certain concentration limits. 
 SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility 
 On October 27, 2021, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement, as amended from time to time, with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent, collateral agent and lender (the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility ). The maximum principal amount of the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility is 385.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. Borrowings under the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility bear interest at adjusted SOFR plus 1.875 or 2.000 , subject to certain provisions in the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility agreement, with no benchmark rate floor. We pay unused facility fees of 0.375 per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility. Any amounts borrowed under the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on October 27, 2026. 

million aggregate principal amount of (the Series 2020A Unsecured Notes ). The Series 2020A Unsecured Notes were issued in two 25.0 million issuances on July 30, 2020 and October 28, 2020.

To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced opportunities, or if our Board otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into new debt financing opportunities in addition to our existing debt. The pricing and other terms of any such opportunities would depend upon market conditions and the performance of our business, among other factors. 
 In accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with stockholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200 , as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser s and our Board s assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 186 and 186 , respectively. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. See Note 6. Debt to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the debt facilities. 
 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 Our investment portfolio may contain investments that are in the form of lines of credit or unfunded commitments which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had aggregate unfunded commitments totaling 200.1 million and 175.0 million, respectively. 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 On November 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a regular fourth quarter cash dividend of 0.42 per share, which will be paid on January 15, 2025 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the Board declared a supplemental cash dividend of 0.07 per share which will be paid on December 16, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. The supplemental dividend is calculated as 50 of quarterly net investment income in excess of our regular quarterly dividend, subject to certain measurement tests and rounded to the nearest penny.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are party to certain lawsuits in the normal course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with our activities or the activities of our portfolio companies.
