 As of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, the franchise reporting unit had goodwill of million and million, respectively, and the company-owned reporting unit had goodwill for both periods. 
 Reverse stock split: 
 On November 29, 2023, the Company effected a one-for-20 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock, par value per share. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 20 shares of common stock issued and outstanding was converted into one share of common stock. The reverse stock split affected all shareholders uniformly and did not alter any shareholder s percentage interest in the Company s equity. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of common stock were instead entitled to receive a proportional cash payment. All common share and per share amounts presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 
 The reverse stock split affected all issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, as well as the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Company s outstanding stock options and stock unit awards. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options outstanding and the vesting of stock unit awards outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split and correspondingly increased the respective exercise prices or other price dependent terms. 
 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan: 
 On January 28, 2024, the Board authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding share of common stock. The dividend was payable on February 9, 2024 (the Record Date) to the holders of record of shares of common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the Plan), dated as of January 29, 2024, as the same may be amended from time to time between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, as Rights Agent. The Rights and the Plan will expire on the earliest of (i) the close of business on January 29, 2025 (or such later date as may be established by the Board of Directors prior to the Expiration Date as long as the extension is submitted to the shareholders of the Company for ratification at the next annual or special meeting of shareholders succeeding such extension), (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged pursuant to the Plan, (iii) the time at which the Rights (other than Rights owned by an Acquiring Person) are exchanged pursuant to the Plan, (iv) the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of the Tax Benefits, or (v) the beginning of a taxable year to which the Board determines that no Tax Benefits may be carried forward.

 Stock Warrants Issued in Connection with Long-Term Debt: 
 In connection with the 2024 Credit agreement (as defined in Note 9 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company issued detachable warrants to affiliates of TCW Asset Management Company, LLC, and Asilia Investments. Pursuant to the warrants, the holders can purchase up to an aggregate shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, at an exercise price equal to per share. The warrants are exercisable for a period beginning June 24, 2024. The warrants may also be exercised on a cashless basis under certain circumstances under the agreement. 
 
 In addition, in connection with the issuance of the warrants, the Company granted an exemption in favor of each holder pursuant to Section 36 of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the Plan), dated January 29, 2024 , among the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, such that neither holder was deemed to be an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Plan) solely in connection with (i) the issuance of the warrants nor (ii) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of securities of the Company pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. 
 The warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and may not be sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Based in part upon the representations of each holder in each warrant, the offering and sale of each warrant is exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. 
 The warrants are valued at million using a relative fair value method and were accounted for through additional paid-in capital. Further, the related financing fees incurred as a result of warrant issuance is recorded through a contra-equity account and amounts to million. 
 Prior to the second anniversary of the issue date, the Company may call for cancellation up to an aggregate shares of common stock underlying the warrants for consideration equal to per share; provided, that the volume weighted average price on the trading day immediately preceding the date the Company delivers a written call notice to a holder exceeds . As of September 30, 2024, the Company has no intentions of exercising this call provision. The Company will reassess this provision on a quarterly basis.

Rental income associated with the sublease of the corporate office space is recorded in other income and was million and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Upon termination of previously impaired leases, the Company derecognizes the corresponding ROU assets and lease liabilities, which results in a net gain. In addition, the Company recognizes a benefit from lease liabilities decreasing in excess of previously impaired ROU assets for ongoing leases that were previously impaired. 
 (3) Franchise salon rent is a benefit in the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to settlements with landlords for less than previously accrued. 
 
 The Company leases salon premises in which the majority of its franchisees operate and has entered into corresponding sublease arrangements with franchisees. All lease-related costs are passed through to the franchisees. The Company records the rental payments due from franchisees as franchise rental income and the corresponding amounts owed to landlords as franchise rent expense on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, franchise rental income and franchise rent expense were million and million, respectively.

lease term option when the lease is expected to be renewed. The ROU asset is initially and subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, less accrued lease payments and unamortized lease incentives received, if any. Expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including the lease renewal option when the lease is expected to be renewed. Generally, the non-lease components, such as real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses, are separate from rent expense within the lease and are not included in the measurement of the lease liability because these charges are variable. 
 The discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the Company's estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for the respective lease terms, as the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot generally be determined. The Company uses the portfolio approach in applying the discount rate based on the original lease term. The weighted average remaining lease term was and years, and the weighted average discount rate was and for all salon operating leases as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is designed to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. This MD A should be read in conjunction with the MD A included in our June 30, 2024, Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents filed or furnished with the SEC during the current fiscal year. 
 MANAGEMENT'S OVERVIEW 
 Regis Corporation (NasdaqGM:RGS) is a leader in the beauty salon industry. As of September 30, 2024, the Company franchised or owned 4,359 locations, primarily in North America. Our locations consisted of 4,350 franchised salons and 9 company-owned salons.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 203 employees. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing the interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make various judgments, estimates and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We base these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and (2) other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Changes in these estimates could have a material effect on our interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Goodwill 
 The Company assesses goodwill impairment on an annual basis, during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. An interim impairment analysis was not required in the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, the franchise reporting unit had goodwill of 173.4 million and 173.1 million, respectively, and the company-owned reporting unit had no goodwill for both periods. 
 Our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of the June 30, 2024, Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies from those disclosed on our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 System-wide results 
 Our results are impacted by our system-wide sales, which include sales by all points of distribution, whether owned by our franchisees or the Company. While we do not record sales by franchisees as revenue, and such sales are not included in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we believe that this operating measure is important in obtaining an understanding of our financial performance. We believe system-wide sales information aids in understanding how we derive royalty revenue and in evaluating performance. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, a net 41 franchise salons have closed, which will reduce future royalty income. 
 The following table summarizes system-wide revenue and system-wide same-store sales by concept: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in Millions) System-wide revenue 285.6 306.6 Supercuts 0.8 2.2 SmartStyle (6.6) (2.0) Portfolio Brands (1.1) 3.7 Total system-wide same-store sales (1) (1.1) 1.8 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) System-wide same-store sales are calculated as the total change in sales for system-wide franchise and company-owned locations that were open on a specific day of the week during the current period and the corresponding prior period. Quarterly system-wide same-store sales are the sum of the system-wide same-store sales computed on a daily basis. Franchise salons that do not report daily sales are excluded from same-store sales. System-wide same-store sales are calculated in local currencies to remove foreign currency fluctuations from the calculation.

 Product Sales to Franchisees 
 Product sales to franchisees in the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 0.4 million, or 100.0 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Company's shift in its product business from a wholesale model to a third-party distribution model.

Results of Operations by Segment 
 Based on our internal management structure, we report two segments: franchise and company-owned salons. See Note 12 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant results of continuing operations are discussed below with respect to each of these segments.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Franchise Revenue 
 Franchise revenue decreased 6.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in franchise revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the decrease in franchise salon count and negative same-store-sales. 
 Franchise Adjusted EBITDA 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, franchise adjusted EBITDA totaled 8.0 million, a decrease of 0.6 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in royalties and fees.

 28 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 In June 2024, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with TCW Asset Management Company, LLC, and MidCap Financial Trust, which matures in June 2029. In addition to a 10.0 million minimum liquidity covenant, the agreement includes typical provisions and financial covenants, including leverage and fixed-charge coverage ratio covenants. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and our credit agreement are our most significant sources of liquidity. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity, cash on hand and borrowing capacity to meet its obligations in the next twelve months and until maturity of the credit agreement in June 2029. 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were 6.3 million, with 5.4 million and 0.9 million within the United States and Canada, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's borrowing arrangements include a 104.7 million term loan, 1.3 million of paid-in-kind interest and a 25.0 million revolving credit facility that matures in June 2029. As of September 30, 2024, the unused available credit under the revolving credit facility was 15.7 million, the credit agreement has a minimum liquidity covenant of 10.0 million, and total available liquidity per the agreement was 11.9 million. See Note 9 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On June 30, 2022, the Company sold its OSP software-as-a-service solution to Soham, Inc., for a purchase price of 20.0 million in cash plus additional cash proceeds contingent upon the number of salons that migrate to Soham's Zenoti product as their salon technology platform. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has received 21.0 million in cash proceeds. The Company expects additional proceeds in fiscal year 2025 of approximately 7.0 to 7.5 million. 
 
 Uses of Cash 
 The Company closely manages its liquidity and capital resources. The Company's liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the performance of the business, the level of investment needed to support its business strategies, credit facilities and borrowing arrangements, and working capital management. 
 Cash Requirements 
 The Company's most significant contractual cash requirements as of September 30, 2024, were lease commitments and interest payments. See Notes 8 and 9 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 29 

Cash Flows 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 1.3 million compared to a 2.8 million cash use in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in operating activities improved year over year due primarily to our lower cost structure, resulting primarily from a lower headcount in addition to less cash used for working capital. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities of 0.9 million was primarily due to OSP sale proceeds of 957 thousand. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities of 0.2 million was primarily due to salon capital improvements. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 6.5 million, primarily as a result of the repayment of long-term debt of 0.3 million and repayments of the revolving credit facility of 10.2 million, partially offset by 4.3 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 1.7 million, primarily as a result of debt refinancing fees of 0.2 million, partially offset by 2.0 million in borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 See Note 9 of the Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 for additional information regarding our financing arrangements. 
 Debt to Capitalization Ratio 
 Our debt to capitalization ratio, calculated as the principal amount of debt, including paid-in-kind interest accrued, as a percentage of the principal amount of debt and shareholders' equity (deficit) at fiscal quarter end, was as follows: Debt to Capitalization (1) September 30, 2024 66.2 June 30, 2024 67.0 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Excludes the long-term lease liability as that liability is offset by the ROU asset. 
 Share Issuance Program 
 In February 2021, the Company filed a 150.0 million shelf registration statement and 50.0 million prospectus supplement with the SEC under which it could offer and sell, from time to time, up to 50.0 million worth of its common stock in "at-the-market" offerings. The Share Issuance Program expired on February 10, 2024. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In May 2000, the Board approved a stock repurchase program with no stated expiration date. Since that time and through September 30, 2024, the Board has authorized 650.0 million to be expended for the repurchase of the Company's stock under this program. All repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares of the Company. The timing and amounts of any repurchases depend on many factors, including the market price of the common stock and overall market conditions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.5 million shares have been cumulatively repurchased for 595.4 million, and 54.6 million remain outstanding under the approved stock repurchase program. The Company does not anticipate repurchasing shares of common stock for the foreseeable future.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. There has been no material change to the factors discussed within Part II, Item 7A in the Company's June 30, 2024, Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), at the end of the period.

 32 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Like certain other franchisors, the Company has been faced with allegations of franchise regulation and agreement violations. Additionally, because the Company may be the tenant under a master lease for a location subleased to a franchisee, the Company faces allegations of non-payment of rent and associated charges. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined. Although the actions are being vigorously defended, the Company could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 33 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In May 2000, the Board approved a stock repurchase program with no stated expiration date. Since that time and through September 30, 2024, the Board has authorized 650.0 million to be expended for the repurchase of the Company's stock under this program. All repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares of the Company. The Company last purchased shares in fiscal year 2020. As of September 30, 2024, a total accumulated 1.5 million shares have been repurchased for 595.4 million. At September 30, 2024, 54.6 million remain outstanding under the approved stock repurchase program. The Company does not expect to repurchase shares in fiscal year 2025. 

Item 5. Other Information
