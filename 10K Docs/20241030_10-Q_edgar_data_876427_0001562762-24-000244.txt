to 1. In addition, our ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR, as defined in the Credit Facility, cannot exceed to 1, subject to certain exceptions under the Credit Facility. On May 23, 2024, we entered into an amendment (the Fourth Amendment to our Credit Facility. The Fourth Amendment amends the terms of certain of the financial and restrictive covenants in the Credit Facility to provide us with additional flexibility to operate our business from the first quarter of fiscal 2025 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 (the Covenant Relief Period ). We may voluntarily exit the Covenant Relief Period at any time, which would revert the terms of the Credit Facility to the terms existing before the Fourth Amendment, with the exception of the modified definition of EBITDAR, described below. During the Covenant Relief Period, the minimum interest coverage ratio will be reduced from x to 1.00x to: (a) x to 1.00x from the first quarter of fiscal 2025 through the first quarter of fiscal 2026; (b) x to 1.00x from the second quarter of fiscal 2026 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026; and (c) x to 1.00x for the first quarter of fiscal 2027 and thereafter. During the Covenant Relief Period, the maximum ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR remains at x to 1.00x, except that, if we completed a qualified acquisition during the Covenant Relief Period, the maximum ratio would increase to x to 1.00x for a certain 12-month period after the qualified acquisition. In addition, the Fourth Amendment modifies the definition of EBITDAR to permit add-backs relating to expenses, and restrict add-backs related to gains, associated with store closures of (a) all non-cash items and (b) cash items up to of EBITDA from the first quarter of fiscal 2025 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 and up to of EBITDA from the first quarter of fiscal 2027 and thereafter. During the Covenant Relief Period, the interest rate spread charged on borrowings increases by basis points. During the Covenant Relief Period, the restrictions on our ability to declare dividends were modified to reduce the cushion inside the threshold required for us to be able to declare dividends without restriction from x to x. In addition, during the Covenant Relief Period, we must have minimum liquidity of at least million to declare dividends. We are prohibited from repurchasing our securities during the Covenant Relief Period if there are outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility immediately before or after giving effect to the repurchase. During the Covenant Relief Period, we may acquire stores or other businesses as long as we have minimum liquidity of at least million after completing the acquisition. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 28, 2024. Except as amended by the First Amendment, Second Amendment, Third Amendment and Fourth Amendment, the remaining terms of the Credit Facility remain in full force and effect. Within the Credit Facility, we have a sub-facility of million available for the purpose of issuing standby letters of credit. The sub-facility requires fees aggregating to basis points annually of the face amount of each standby letter of credit, payable quarterly in arrears.

Our outstanding supplier obligations eligible for advance payment under the program totaled million, million, and million as of September 28, 2024, March 30, 2024, and September 23, 2023, respectively, and are included within Accounts Payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In exchange for this sunset of the Class C Preferred Stock, the conversion rate of Class C Preferred Stock was adjusted so that each share of Class C Preferred Stock will convert into shares of common stock (the adjusted conversion rate ), an increase from the prior conversion rate of shares of common stock for each share of Class C Preferred Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation. At the end of the sunset period, all shares of Class C Preferred Stock remaining outstanding will be automatically converted into shares of common stock at the adjusted conversion rate. In addition, the liquidation preference for the Class C Preferred Stock was amended to provide that, upon a liquidation event, each holder of Class C Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive, for each share of Class C Preferred Stock held by the holder upon a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the Company, an amount equal to the greater of per share and the amount the holder would have received had each share of Class C Preferred Stock been converted to shares of common stock immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up. There was Class C Preferred Stock converted during fiscal 2025 or 2024. The Reclassification Agreement also provides that, during the sunset period, the Class C Holders will have the right to appoint member of the Board of Directors. This designee is expected to be Peter J. Solomon, who is one of the Company s current directors and one of the Class C Holders. We have determined the amendments to the Class C Preferred Stock, because of the Reclassification Agreement, should be accounted for as a modification.

 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Developments On July 3, 2024, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters. We received net proceeds of approximately 9.1 million and recorded a net gain of approximately 2.8 million. See additional discussion in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. On October 23, 2024, American Tire Distributors, Inc. ATD ), one of our vendors for tires, filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. While ATD has proposed restructuring its business with the support of its lenders, uncertainty exists about how our distribution and fulfillment agreement with ATD will be treated in the proceeding and whether and when we will receive the remaining 6.8 million in earnout payments from our divesture of assets to ATD. We intend to seek the remaining earnout payments and future performance under the distribution agreement with ATD so that we will be able to continue to provide high-quality service to our guests. Economic Conditions The United States economy has experienced higher inflation during fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025 and there are market expectations that consumer prices may remain at elevated levels for a sustained period. In addition, labor availability has continued to be constrained and market labor costs have continued to increase. These conditions may give rise to an economic slowdown, and perhaps a recession, and could further increase our costs and/or impact our revenues. It is unclear whether the current economic conditions and government responses to these conditions, including inflation, changing interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty, will result in an economic slowdown or recession in the United States. If that occurs, demand for our products and services may further decline, possibly significantly, which may significantly and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. Financial Summary Second quarter 2025 included the following notable items: Diluted earnings per common share EPS were 0.18. Adjusted diluted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, were 0.17. Sales decreased 6.4 percent, due to lower overall comparable store sales resulting from lower store traffic. Comparable store sales decreased 5.8 percent. Operating income of 13.2 million was 40.9 percent lower than the comparable prior-year period. Net income was 5.6 million. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was 5.2 million. Earnings Per Common Share Three Months Ended Six Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Change September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Change Diluted EPS 0.18 0.40 (55.0) 0.37 0.68 (45.6) Adjustments (0.02) 0.01 0.02 0.04 Adjusted diluted EPS 0.17 0.41 (58.5) 0.39 0.72 (45.8) 
 Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, each of which is a measure not derived in accordance with GAAP, exclude the impact of certain items. Management believes that adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations by excluding certain non-recurring items, such as costs related to closed store impairment charges, store closing costs, transition costs related to back-office optimization, shareholder matters from our equity capital structure recapitalization, and a gain on sale of corporate headquarters net of closing and relocation costs. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures are provided beginning on page 17 under Non-GAAP Financial Measures. We define comparable store sales as sales for locations that have been opened or owned at least one full fiscal year. We believe this period is generally required for new store sales levels to begin to normalize. Management uses comparable store sales to assess the operating performance of the Company s stores and believes the metric is useful to investors because our overall results are dependent upon the results of our stores. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. Therefore, our comparable store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Analysis of Results of Operations Summary of Operating Income Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (thousands) September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Change September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Change Sales 301,391 322,091 (6.4) 594,573 649,059 (8.4) Cost of sales, including occupancy costs 195,014 207,118 (5.8) 379,010 419,691 (9.7) Gross profit 106,377 114,973 (7.5) 215,563 229,368 (6.0) Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 93,175 92,618 0.6 189,114 189,664 (0.3) Operating income 13,202 22,355 (40.9) 26,449 39,704 (33.4) 
 Sales Sales include automotive undercar repair, tire replacement and tire related service sales, net of discounts, returns, etc., and revenue from the sale of warranty agreements and commissions earned from the delivery of tires. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. We use comparable store sales to evaluate the performance of our existing stores by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. There were 91 selling days in the three months ended September 28, 2024 and in the three months ended September 23, 2023, and 181 selling days in the six months ended September 28, 2024 and in the six months ended September 23, 2023. Sales growth from both comparable store sales and new stores represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable store sales growth will significantly impact our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our customers , often referred to as guests , experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price strategy, convenience, and other factors will, over the long-term, drive both increasing guest traffic and the average ticket amount spent. Sales Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (thousands) September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Sales 301,391 322,091 594,573 649,059 Dollar change compared to prior year (20,700) (54,486) Percentage change compared to prior year (6.4) (8.4) 
 The sales decrease was primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales resulting from lower store traffic. An increase in battery sales of 20 and 8 in the three months and six months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, slightly offsets the decrease in sales. The following table shows the primary drivers of the change in sales for the three months and six months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the same period ended September 23, 2023. Sales Percentage Change Three Months Ended Six Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 28, 2024 Sales change (6.4) (8.4) Primary drivers of change in sales Comparable store sales (5.8) (7.8) Closed store sales (0.6) (0.6) 
 Broad-based economic pressures impacting consumers partly led to lower demand in tires and our higher-margin service categories during the three months and six months ended September 28, 2024. We expect the economic environment to continue to impact our customers throughout the remainder of fiscal 2025.

 Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 40 basis points bps for the three months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the prior year comparable period. Material costs increased, as a percentage of sales, due primarily to mix within tires. Occupancy costs increased, as a percentage of sales, as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower overall comparable store sales. Partially offsetting this was a decrease in technician labor costs, as a percentage of sales, due primarily to improvements in labor productivity and efficiency. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 100 basis points for the six months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the prior year comparable period. The increase in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to improvements in labor productivity and efficiency, partially offset by the increase in occupancy costs as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs.

 The increase of .6 million in operating, selling, general and administrative OSG A expenses for the three months ended September 28, 2024, from the comparable prior year period is due to an increase in OSG A expenses from store advertising costs, closed store impairment charges, comparable stores, transition costs related to back-office optimization, as well as costs from new stores and other non-recurring costs. Partially offsetting these increases was the net gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters, as well as a decrease in costs from closed stores and decreased costs related to shareholder matters from our equity capital structure recapitalization incurred during the comparable period. The following table shows the impact of these costs on the change in OSG A expenses for the three months and six months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the same periods ended September 23, 2023.

 Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense of 5.1 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 0.3 million as compared to the prior year period, and increased as a percentage of sales from 1.5 percent to 1.7 percent. Weighted average debt outstanding for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased by approximately 21.3 million as compared to the three months ended September 23, 2023. This decrease is primarily related to lower finance lease debt related to our stores, partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding under the Credit Facility. The weighted average interest rate increased approximately 60 basis points as compared to the same period of the prior year. Net interest expense of 10.3 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 increased 0.3 million compared to the prior year period, and increased as a percentage of sales from 1.5 percent to 1.7 percent. Weighted average debt outstanding for the six months ended September 28, 2024 decreased by approximately 21.9 million and the weighted average interest rate increased approximately 40 basis points as compared to the same period of the prior year. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate for the three months and six months ended September 28, 2024 was 30.9 percent and 29.7 percent, respectively, compared with 26.8 percent and 27.1 percent in the comparable prior-year periods. The difference from the statutory rate is primarily due to state taxes and the discrete tax impact related to share-based awards. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting net income and diluted EPS, which are GAAP measures, this Form 10-Q includes adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have included reconciliations to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS from our most directly comparable GAAP measures, net income and diluted EPS, below. Management views these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators to better assess comparability between periods because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our core business operations while excluding certain non-recurring items, such as costs related to closed store impairment charges, store closing costs, transition costs related to back-office optimization, shareholder matters from our equity capital structure recapitalization, and a gain on sale of corporate headquarters net of closing and relocation costs. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent, and should not be considered more meaningful than, or as an alternative to, their most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Adjusted net income is summarized as follows: Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (thousands) September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Net income 5,647 12,872 11,510 21,701 Store impairment charges 1,031 1,551 Transition costs related to back-office optimization 553 97 1,150 641 Store closing costs 531 (43) 712 4 Costs related to shareholder matters 439 1,275 Acquisition due diligence and integration costs 5 Net gain on sale of corporate headquarters (a) (2,764) 60 (2,639) 60 Provision for income taxes on pre-tax adjustments 177 (143) (210) (502) Adjusted net income 5,175 13,282 12,074 23,184 
 (a) Amount includes the gain on sale of the corporate headquarters building net of closing and relocation costs. In the Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income, we determined the Provision for income taxes on pre-tax adjustments by calculating our estimated annual effective income tax rate on pre-tax income before giving effect to any discrete tax items and applying it to the pre-tax adjustments. Adjusted diluted EPS is summarized as follows: Reconciliation of Adjusted Diluted EPS Three Months Ended Six Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Diluted EPS 0.18 0.40 0.37 0.68 Store impairment charges 0.02 0.04 Transition costs related to back-office optimization (a) 0.01 0.00 0.03 0.01 Store closing costs (a) 0.01 (0.00) 0.02 0.00 Costs related to shareholder matters 0.01 0.03 Acquisition due diligence and integration costs (a) 0.00 Net gain on sale of corporate headquarters (a) (b) (0.06) 0.00 (0.06) 0.00 Adjusted diluted EPS 0.17 0.41 0.39 0.72 
 (a) Amounts, in the periods presented, may be too minor in amount, net of the impact from income taxes, to have an impact on the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS. (b) Amount includes the gain on sale of the corporate headquarters building net of closing and relocation costs. Note: The calculation of the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted EPS is performed on each line independently. The table may not add down +/- 0.01 due to rounding. The other adjustments to diluted EPS reflect estimated annual effective income tax rates of 27.3 percent and 25.8 percent for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 23, 2023, respectively and 27.1 percent and 25.3 percent for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 23, 2023, respectively. These estimated annual effective income tax rates exclude the income tax impacts from share-based compensation. See adjustments from the Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income table above for pre-tax amounts. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Allocation We expect to continue to generate positive operating cash flow as we have done in each of the last three fiscal years. The cash we generate from our operations will allow us to continue to support business operations as well as invest in opportunities intended to drive long-term sustainable growth, pay down debt, and return cash to our shareholders through our dividend program. In addition, because we believe a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, through acquisition of retail stores and/or opening greenfield stores, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to fund the growth of our business through borrowings on our Credit Facility. Conversely, we may also periodically determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. 

 Monro, Inc. Q2 2025 Form 10-Q 18 
 
 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Future Cash Requirements We currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects, including upgrading our facilities and systems, to be 25 million to 35 million in the aggregate in fiscal 2025. Additionally, we have contractual finance lease and operating lease commitments with landlords through October 2040 for 477.4 million in lease payments, of which 96.6 million is due within one year. For details regarding these lease commitments, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. As of September 28, 2024, we had 62.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, none of which is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness that is due, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends We paid cash dividends of 0.28 per share totaling 8.7 million and 8.9 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 23, 2023, respectively, and 0.56 per share totaling 17.4 million and 17.9 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 23, 2023, respectively. Working Capital Management As of September 28, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 234.7 million, an increase of 32.8 million from a deficit of 201.9 million as of March 30, 2024. The overall working capital deficit is a result of our supply chain finance program. We have agreed to contractual payment terms and conditions with our suppliers. As part of our working capital management, we facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program to provide our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from Monro to a participating financial institution. For details regarding our supply chain finance program, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly cash from operations, availability under our Credit Facility, and cash and equivalents on hand. As of September 28, 2024, we had 20.9 million of cash and equivalents. In addition, we had 507.9 million available under the Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024. We believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following September 28, 2024, as well as in the long-term. Summary of Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. Summary of Cash Flows Six Months Ended (thousands) September 28, 2024 September 23, 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 88,197 98,307 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities 4,638 (6,667) Cash used for financing activities (78,537) (87,471) Increase in cash and equivalents 14,298 4,169 Cash and equivalents at beginning of period 6,561 4,884 Cash and equivalents at end of period 20,859 9,053 
 Cash provided by operating activities For the six months ended September 28, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 88.2 million, which consisted of net income of 11.5 million, increased by non-cash adjustments of 39.0 million and net change in operating assets and liabilities of 37.7 million. The non-cash charges were largely driven by 35.2 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as 3.4 million in deferred income tax expense. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to our supply chain finance program being a source of cash as we improved our cash flow by 67.5 million. This was partially offset by accrued expenses and other current assets being a use of cash of 17.0 million, as well as our inventory balance being a use of cash of 7.7 million. For the six months ended September 24, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was 98.3 million, which consisted of net income of 21.7 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of 42.8 million and by a change in operating assets and liabilities of 33.9 million. The non-cash charges were largely driven by 36.5 million of depreciation and amortization , as well as 5.7 million in deferred income tax

expense . The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to our supply chain finance program being a source of cash as we improved our cash flow by 28.6 million. Additionally, the change in operating assets and liabilities was also partially due to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net of vendor rebate receivables, being a source of cash of 6.9 million driven by timing of payments. Cash used for investing activities For the six months ended September 28, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was 4.6 million. This was primarily due to cash provided by payments from the disposal of property and equipment, including the proceeds related to the sale of our corporate headquarters, for 9.9 million, and cash provided by the earnout payment from the sale of our wholesale tire locations and distribution assets of 8.5 million. This was partially offset by cash used for capital expenditures, including property and equipment, of 13.8 million. For the six months ended September 23, 2023, cash used for investing activities was 6.7 million. This was primarily due to cash used for capital expenditures, including property and equipment, of 15.7 million, partially offset by cash provided by the earnout payment from the sale of our wholesale tire locations and distribution assets and the disposal of property and equipment of 7.3 million and 1.7 million, respectively. Cash used for financing activities For the six months ended September 28, 2024, cash used for financing activities was 78.5 million, which was primarily due to payment on our Credit Facility, net of amounts borrowed during the period, of 40.0 million, as well as payment of finance lease principal and dividends of 20.0 million and 17.4 million, respectively. For the six months ended September 23, 2023, cash used for financing activities was 87.5 million, which was primarily due to payment on our Credit Facility, net of amounts borrowed during the period, of 50.0 million, as well as payment of finance lease principal and dividends of 19.6 million and 17.9 million, respectively. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be affected. For a description of our critical accounting estimates, refer to Part II , Item 7 . , Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Form 10-K for the year ended March 30, 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements as of September 28, 2024 and the expected impact on the consolidated financial statements for future periods.

 Table of Contents DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from potential changes in interest rates. As of September 28, 2024, excluding finance leases and financing obligations, we had no debt financing at fixed interest rates, for which the fair value would be affected by changes in market interest rates. Our cash flow exposure on floating rate debt would result in annual interest expense fluctuations of approximately 0.6 million based upon our debt position at September 28, 2024 and approximately 1.0 million based upon our debt position at March 30, 2024, given a change in SOFR of 100 basis points. Debt financing had a carrying amount that approximates a fair value of 62.0 million as of September 28, 2024, as compared to a carrying amount and a fair value of 102.0 million as of March 30, 2024. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit to the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) , we conduct an update, a review and an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. It is the conclusion of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon an evaluation completed as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter reported on herein, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Except as stated below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I , Item 1A. , Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024. We depend on our relationships with our vendors for certain inventory and those vendors may be unable to perform under our existing agreements with them. We depend on close relationships with our vendors for parts, tires and supplies and for our ability to purchase products at competitive prices and terms. Our ability to purchase at competitive prices and terms results from the volume of our purchases from these vendors. We entered into various contracts with parts suppliers that require us to buy from them (at market competitive prices) up to 100 percent of our annual purchases of specific products. These agreements expire at various dates. For example, under the distribution agreement with ATD, we rely on ATD for most of certain passenger car tires, light truck replacement tires, and medium truck tires that we sell to our customers. Under the distribution agreement with ATD, our company-owned stores must purchase at least 90 of their forecasted requirements for these tires from or through ATD, subject to some exceptions. In addition, under the agreement governing the divestiture of our assets to ATD, ATD was obligated to make earnout payments to us totaling 40.0 million, of which 6.8 million remains outstanding. On October 23, 2024, ATD filed for bankruptcy protection. There can be no assurance that ATD will continue to perform under the distribution agreement or under the divestiture agreement, which could result in our inability to collect the remaining 6.8 million of earnout payments. If ATD is unable to supply our requirements for tires due to its bankruptcy or for other reasons and we are unable to purchase our desired volume of tires on the same or better terms as in the distribution agreement, or at all, our sales and ability to service our customers could suffer considerably if we are unable to find an alternative vendor of tires on similar terms. While we may be able to identify alternative sources for most of the products we sell or use at our stores, the loss of a major supplier like ATD or the loss of a combination of suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of our suppliers do not perform adequately or otherwise fail to distribute parts or other supplies to our stores, our inability to replace the suppliers in a timely manner and on acceptable terms could increase our costs and could cause shortages or interruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because we purchase products such as oil and tires, which are subject to cost variations related to commodity costs, if we cannot pass along cost increases, our profitability would be negatively impacted.
