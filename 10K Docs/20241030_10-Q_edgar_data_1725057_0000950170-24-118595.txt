 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING F ORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") contains, or incorporates by reference, not only historical information, but also forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act and that are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning the conditions of the human capital management solutions industry and our operations, performance, and financial condition, and include, in particular, statements relating to our business, growth strategies, product development efforts, and future expenses. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipate, intend, plan, seek, believe, estimate, expect, assume, project, could, continue, likely, may, will, should, and similar references to future periods, or by the inclusion of forecasts or projections. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Consequently, our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include regional, national, or global political, economic, business, competitive, market, and regulatory conditions. In particular: 
 
 our inability to maintain our high Cloud solutions growth rate, manage our domestic and international growth effectively, or execute on our growth strategy; 

the impact of disruptions to the movement of funds to initiate payroll-related transactions on behalf of customers; 

our failure to manage our aging technical infrastructure; 

system breaches, interruptions or failures, including cyber-security breaches, identity theft, or other disruptions that could compromise customer information or sensitive company information, including our ongoing consent order with the Federal Trade Commission regarding data protection; 

our failure to comply with applicable privacy, data protection, information security, and financial services laws, regulations and standards; 

our inability to successfully compete in the markets in which we operate and expand our current offerings into new markets or further penetrate existing markets due to competition; 

our failure to properly update our solutions to enable our customers to comply with applicable laws; 

our failure to provide new or enhanced functionality and features, including those that may involve artificial intelligence or machine learning; 

our inability to maintain necessary third-party relationships, and third-party software licenses, and identify errors in the software we license; 

our inability to offer and deliver high-quality technical support, implementation, and professional services; 

our inability to attract and retain senior management employees and highly skilled employees; 

the impact of our outstanding debt obligations on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our common stock; 

our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, and the effect of the existing material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting on our business, financial condition, and results of operations; or 

the impact of adverse economic and market conditions on its business, operating results, or financial condition. 

Please refer to Part II, Item IA. Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ), for a further description of these and other factors. Although we have attempted to identify important risk factors, there may be other risk factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. If any of these risks materialize, or if any of the above assumptions underlying forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results and developments may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. For the reasons described above, we caution against relying on any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date on which we make it. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or to revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should be viewed as historical data.

The Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time only under certain circumstances as outlined in Part II, Item 8, Note 9, Debt, to our audited consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K . The conditions allowing holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert have not been met and therefore were not convertible as of September 30, 2024. On December 30, 2021, we notified the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes of our irrevocable election to settle the conversion obligation in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes submitted for conversion on or after January 1, 2022, or at maturity with a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. Generally, under this settlement method, the conversion value will be settled in cash in an amount no less than the principal amount being converted, and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount will be settled, at our election, in cash or shares of common stock. The Convertible Senior Notes are accounted for as a single liability, and the carrying amount of the Convertible Senior Notes was million as of September 30, 2024, with principal of million , net of issuance costs of million . The Convertible Senior Notes are included within long-term debt, less current portion in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 .

The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Senior Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions, and not part of the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes. As the Capped Calls qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting for instruments that are both indexed to the issuer's own stock and classified in stockholder s equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, we have recorded an amount of million as a reduction to additional paid-in capital which will not be remeasured.

Fair Value of Debt Our debt does not trade in active markets and was considered to be a Level 2 measurement at September 30, 2024 . The fair value of the 2018 Term Debt and 2024 Term Debt were based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms, maturities, and volumes as our debt. The fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes was determined based on the closing trading price per of the Convertible Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the period and is primarily affected by the trading price of our common stock and market interest rates. The fair value of our debt was estimated to be billion and billion as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

The shares underlying the conversion option in the Convertible Senior Notes were not considered in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Based on the initial conversion price, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes as of September 30, 2024 would have been convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock. Since we expect to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes in cash, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect on diluted net income per share, if applicable. As a result, only the amount by which the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes (the conversion spread is considered in the diluted earnings per share computation. The conversion spread has a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share when the average market price of our common stock for a given period exceeds the initial conversion price of per share for the Convertible Senior Notes. We excluded the potentially dilutive effect of the conversion spread of the Convertible Senior Notes as the average market price of our common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was less than the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our 2023 Form 10-K . This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding industry outlook, our expectations for the future of our business, and our liquidity and capital resources as well as other non-historical statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Any reference to a Note in this discussion relates to the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report unless otherwise indicated. 
 Overview 
 Dayforce, Inc. is a global human capital management HCM software company. We categorize our solutions into three categories: Cloud recurring, other recurring, and professional services and other. Cloud recurring revenue is generated from HCM solutions that are primarily delivered via two offerings: Dayforce, our flagship Cloud HCM platform, and Powerpay, a Cloud human resources HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market. Revenue from our Cloud recurring and other recurring solutions includes investment income generated from holding customer funds, also referred to as float revenue or float. 
 Dayforce provides HR, payroll and tax, benefits, workforce management, and talent management functionality. Our platform is used by organizations of all sizes, from small businesses to global organizations, regardless of industry, to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle, including attracting, hiring, engaging, paying, and developing their people. Dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern, consumer-grade user experience with proprietary application architecture, including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of HCM. Dayforce provides continuous real-time calculations across all modules to enable, for example, payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period, and managers access to real-time data to optimize work schedules. Our platform is designed to drive efficiencies for our customers and their employees by improving HCM decision-making processes, streamlining workflows, revealing strategic organizational insights, and simplifying legislative compliance. The platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers, creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement. We sell Dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription per-employee, per-month ("PEPM") basis. Our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years, with evergreen renewal thereafter. 
 Our Business Model 
 Our business model focuses on supporting the growth of Dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our Dayforce customer relationships. Due to our subscription model, where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period, and our high customer retention rates, we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues. The profitability of a customer depends, in large part, on how long they have been a customer. We estimate that it takes approximately two years before we are able to recover our implementation, customer acquisition, and other direct costs on a new Dayforce customer contract. 
 Over the lifetime of the customer relationship, we have the opportunity to realize additional PEPM revenue, both as the customer grows or rolls out the Dayforce solution to additional employees, and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full HCM suite. We also incur costs to manage the account, to retain customers, and to sell additional functionality. These costs, however, are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to take customers live.

 H ow We Assess Our Performance 
 In assessing our performance, we consider a variety of annual and quarterly performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income. Set forth below are descriptions of our quarterly key performance measures. Additional information on our annual performance measures is described in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "How We Assess Our Performance" contained in our 2023 Form 10-K . Please refer to the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" and Results of Operations sections below for further description and definitions of certain performance indicators which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Live Dayforce Customers 
 We use the number of live Dayforce customers as an indicator of future revenue and the overall performance of the business and to assess the performance of our implementation services. 
 Dayforce Recurring Revenue Per Customer 
 We use Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of the average size of our Dayforce customer, which we believe is also useful to management and investors. We calculate and monitor Dayforce recurring revenue per customer on a quarterly basis. Our Dayforce recurring revenue per customer may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the number of live Dayforce customers and the number of customers purchasing our full HCM suite. 
 Constant Currency Revenue 
 We present percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis to assess how our underlying business performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to management and investors. The average U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate was 1.36 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.34 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Cloud Recurring Gross Margin 
 We believe that Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted Cloud recurring gross margin, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a component of our management incentive plan and Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted Cloud recurring gross margin are components of certain performance based equity awards for our named executive officers, and these metrics are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because these metrics exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations.

This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in live Dayforce customers, the increase in Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, and the increase in float revenue. The number of live Dayforce customers increased 6.1 to 6,730 at September 30, 2024 from 6,346 at September 30, 2023. Additionally, for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Dayforce recurring revenue per customer grew to 159,496 compared to 138,838 for the comparable period in 2023. Please refer to the "How We Assess Performance" and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for discussion of and the definition of Dayforce recurring revenue per customer. 
 The increase in Dayforce recurring revenue per customer is driven by the growing average size of our customers, as we continue to expand within the enterprise segment, as well as more customers purchasing our full HCM suite. The increase in float revenue is driven by an increase in average yield of 20 basis points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, in addition to a 11.4 increase in average float balance for our customer funds for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which increased to 4.48 billion, compared to 4.02 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of revenue. Total cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 238.7 million, an increase of 21.7 million, or 10.0 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Recurring cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 6.9 million, or 8.6 , compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to additional labor-related costs incurred and increased costs of hosting our applications to support the growing Dayforce customer base globally.

 Professional services and other cost of revenue increased 9.0 million, or 13.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased labor-related costs incurred to take new customers live. 
 Product development and management expense increased 2.1 million, or 3.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects additional personnel costs and increased costs of hosting our development applications. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our investment in software development was 52.4 million and 51.4 million, respectively, consisting of 29.5 million and 28.9 million of research and development expense, and 22.9 million and 22.5 million in capitalized software development costs, respectively. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased 3.7 million, or 21.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as we continue to capitalize and subsequently amortize Dayforce related and other development costs.

Total gross margin is defined as total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, which is inclusive of product development and management costs, as well as depreciation and amortization associated with cost of revenue. Gross margin for each solution in the table above is defined as total revenue less cost of revenue for the applicable solution as a percentage of total revenue for that related solution, which is exclusive of any product development and management or depreciation and amortization cost allocations. 
 Total gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 330 basis points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and gross profit increased by 40.8 million, or 25.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the 62.5 million or 16.6 increase in revenue, including float revenue, which outpaced the increase in cost of revenue. 
 Cloud recurring gross margin was 79.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Cloud recurring gross margin was primarily due to the increase in revenue, including float revenue, and due to the growth of the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than two years, which increased from 82 as of September 30, 2023 to 87 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Professional services and other gross margin improved to (17.2) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (26.9) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling and marketing expense. Selling and marketing expense increased 24.6 million, or 39.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling and marketing expense is primarily driven by higher personnel-related costs, as well as higher advertising expenses related to the transition of the Company's name and branding to Dayforce, Inc. 
 General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased 21.9 million, or 30.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily driven by increases in amortization of intangible assets, employee-related costs, and the remeasurement of the DataFuzion contingent consideration. Amortization of the Ceridian trade name contributed 7.0 million of the increase in expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Operating profit. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating profit was 20.8 million, compared to 26.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating profit decreased primarily due to the increase in amortization expense and selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by gross margin expansion, driven by an increase in revenue, including float revenue. 
 Interest income. Interest income was 4.8 million and 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower invested balances during the period. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 13.6 million and 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in applicable reference rates on our Term Debt. 
 Other expense, net. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we incurred other income, net of 6.3 million and other expense, net of 5.1 million, respectively. Other expense, net was primarily comprised of foreign currency translation losses (gains) and net periodic pension expense. 
 Income tax expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 16.3 million for both periods. The components of income tax expense changing year over year include increases of 2.8 million attributable to share-based compensation, 1.9 million attributable to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, 1.7 million attributable to foreign tax rate differences, and 1.2 million attributable to current operations, partially offset by decreases of 6.4 million attributable to the change in valuation allowance, 2.6 million attributable to Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax, and 1.9 million attributable to tax credits. 
 Net income (loss). We realized net income of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in revenue, including float revenue, gross margin expansion, and other income, net, partially offset by increases in amortization expense.

a) Dayforce has calculated percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying the average foreign exchange rate in effect during the comparable prior period. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for discussion of percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis. 

b) Float attributable to Other recurring was 0.9 million and 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

c) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Professional services and other consisted of 164.4 million, 6.6 million, and 0.2 million associated with Dayforce, Other, and Powerpay, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Professional services and other consisted of 144.6 million, 11.1 million, and 0.1 million associated with Dayforce, Other, and Powerpay respectively. 

Total revenue increased 180.8 million, or 16.2 , to 1,294.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,114.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in live Dayforce customers, the increase in Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, and the increase in float revenue. The number of live Dayforce customers increased 6.1 to 6,730 at September 30, 2024 from 6,346 at September 30, 2023. Additionally, for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Dayforce recurring revenue per customer grew to 159,496 compared to 138,838 for the comparable period in 2023. Please refer to the "How We Assess Performance" and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for discussion of and the definition of Dayforce recurring revenue per customer. 
 The increase in Dayforce recurring revenue per customer is driven by the growing average size of our customers, as we continue to expand within the enterprise segment, as well as more customers purchasing our full HCM suite. The increase in float revenue is driven by an increase in average yield of 37 basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in addition to a 7.2 increase in average float balance for our customer funds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which increased to 4.94 billion, compared to 4.61 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of revenue. Total cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 701.3 million, an increase of 64.0 million, or 10.0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Recurring cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 25.7 million, or 10.7 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to additional labor-related costs and increased costs of hosting our applications to support the growing Dayforce customer base globally.

Table of Contents 

 Professional services and other cost of revenue increased 13.8 million, or 7.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased labor-related costs incurred to take new customers live. 
 Product development and management expense increased 13.3 million, or 8.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects additional personnel costs and increased costs of hosting our development applications. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our investment in software development was 158.3 million and 146.6 million, respectively, consisting of 90.2 million and 80.6 million of research and development expense, and 68.1 million and 66.0 million in capitalized software development costs, respectively. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased 11.2 million, or 23.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we continue to capitalize and subsequently amortize Dayforce related and other development costs.

Total gross margin is defined as total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, which is inclusive of product development and management costs, as well as depreciation and amortization associated with cost of revenue. Gross margin for each solution in the table above is defined as total revenue less cost of revenue for the applicable solution as a percentage of total revenue for that related solution, which is exclusive of any product development and management or depreciation and amortization cost allocations. 
 Total gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 300 basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and gross profit increased by 116.8 million, or 24.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the 180.8 million or 16.2 increase in revenue, including float revenue, which outpaced the increase in cost of revenue. 
 Cloud recurring gross margin was 78.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Cloud recurring gross margin was primarily due to the increase in revenue, including float revenue, and due to the growth of the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than two years, which increased from 82 as of September 30, 2023 to 87 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Professional services and other gross margin improved to (23.1) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (26.4) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling and marketing expense. Selling and marketing expense increased 71.0 million, or 40.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling and marketing expense is primarily driven by higher personnel-related costs, as well as higher advertising expenses related to the transition of the Company's name and branding to Dayforce, Inc. 
 General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased 64.5 million, or 31.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense is driven by increases in amortization of intangible assets, including 48.8 million related to the Ceridian trade name, and employee-related costs, partially offset by a reduction in share-based compensation expense and lower expense related to the DataFuzion contingent consideration.

Table of Contents 

 Operating profit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating profit was 75.6 million, compared to 94.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating profit decreased due to increases in amortization expense and selling and marketing expenses related to rebranding, partially offset by gross margin expansion from the increase in revenue, including float revenue. 
 Interest income. Interest income was 13.3 million and 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower invested balances during the period. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 46.5 million and 41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to a 4.3 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the refinancing of certain credit agreements. Please refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 9, "Debt" for additional information. 
 Other expense, net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we incurred other expense, net of 5.7 million and 6.6 million, respectively. Other expense, net was primarily comprised of foreign currency translation losses (gains) and net periodic pension expense. 
 Income tax expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 29.4 million and 51.3 million, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to 10.8 million attributable to the change in valuation allowance, 6.9 million attributable to tax credits, and 5.1 million attributable to Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax. 
 Net income. We realized net income of 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income declined primarily due to a decrease in operating profit and an increase in other expense, net, partially offset by lower income tax expense. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, availability under our 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Program, and proceeds from debt issuances and equity offerings. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and equivalents of 494.1 million and our total debt was 1,230.1 million. 
 Our primary liquidity needs are related to funding of general business requirements, including the payment of interest and principal on our debt, capital expenditures, fulfilling our contractual commitments, product development, and funding Dayforce Wallet on-demand pay requests on behalf of our customers. From time to time, we have made investments in businesses or acquisitions of companies, which are also liquidity needs. 
 We believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and equivalents, and availability under our 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Program will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the issuance of equity, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, or a combination thereof. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or raise additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which would result in additional expenses and/or dilution. 
 35 | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q 

Table of Contents 

 Our customer funds are held and invested with the primary objectives being to protect the principal balance and to ensure adequate liquidity to meet cash flow requirements. Accordingly, we maintain on average approximately 45 to 55 of customer funds in liquidity portfolios with maturities ranging from one to 120 days, consisting of high-quality bank deposits, money market mutual funds, commercial paper, or collateralized short-term investments; and we maintain on average approximately 45 to 55 of customer funds in fixed income portfolios with maturities ranging from 120 days to 10 years, consisting of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, Canada government and provincial securities, as well as highly rated asset-backed, mortgage-backed, municipal, corporate, and bank securities. To maintain sufficient liquidity to meet payment obligations, we also have financing arrangements and may pledge fixed income securities for short-term financing. The customer assets are held in segregated accounts intended for the specific purpose of satisfying customer funding obligations and therefore are not freely available for our general business use. 
 Statements of Cash Flows 
 Changes in cash flows due to purchases of customer fund marketable securities and proceeds from the sale or maturity of customer fund marketable securities, as well as the carrying value of customer fund accounts as of period end dates can vary significantly due to several factors, including the specific day of the week the period ends, which impacts the timing of funds collected from customers and payments made to satisfy customer obligations to employees, taxing authorities, and others. The customer funds are fully segregated from our operating cash accounts and are evaluated and tracked separately by management. The table below summarizes the activity within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 200.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 129.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For both periods, cash inflows from operating activities are primarily generated from the subscriptions of our solutions. Cash outflows from operating activities for both periods are primarily comprised of personnel-related expenditures, including the payout of year-end employee compensation, and the renewals of prepaid annual contracts that are integral to our business operations. The positive cash inflows in both periods is primarily due to our growing revenue, partially offset by our operating costs, mainly, investment in our sales force to support our growth initiatives and those product development and management costs which are not eligible for capitalization.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 458.1 million, consisting of purchases of customer funds marketable securities of 483.2 million, acquisition costs, net of cash acquired, of 173.1 million, capital expenditures of 82.8 million, and purchases of marketable securities of 10.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of customer funds marketable securities of 283.4 million, and proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities of 7.6 million. Our capital expenditures included 74.1 million for software and technology and 8.7 million for property, plant, and equipment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 14.9 million, consisting of purchases of customer funds marketable securities of 252.0 million and capital expenditures of 88.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of customer funds marketable securities of 326.4 million. Our capital expenditures included 72.9 million for software and technology and 15.4 million for property, plant, and equipment.

 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 1,067.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This cash outflow is primarily attributable to a decrease in net customer fund obligations of 1,049.9 million, payments on our long-term debt obligations of 646.5 million, repurchases of common stock of 28.8 million, payment of debt refinancing costs of 11.4 million, and payment of contingent consideration of 3.0 million, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from our debt issuance of 650.0 million and proceeds from issuance of common stock under our share-based compensation plans of 22.0 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 345.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This cash inflow is primarily attributable to an increase in net customer fund obligations of 311.0 million and proceeds from issuance of common stock under our share-based compensation plans of 40.3 million, partially offset by payments on our long-term debt obligations of 6.0 million. 
 Backlog 
 Backlog is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations, which represents contracted revenue for recurring and fixed price professional services, primarily implementation services, that has not yet been recognized, including deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were approximately 1,310.4 million. Please refer to Part 1, Item 1, Note 12, Revenue and Revenue-Related Activities for further discussion of our remaining performance obligations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as such term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K). 
 Contractual Obligations 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as described in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "Contractual Obligations" contained in our 2023 Form 10-K . 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" contained in our 2023 Form 10-K .

 We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance including comparison across periods and with competitors. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance because these financial measures exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations, and are used for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes both for short- and long-term operating plans. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a component of our management incentive plan and Adjusted Cloud recurring gross margin and Adjusted operating profit are components of certain performance based equity awards for our named executive officers. Additionally, we believe that the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to investors because it is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. The exclusion of capital expenditures facilitates comparisons of our liquidity on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that management does not consider to be indicative of our liquidity. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are not required by, defined under, or presented in accordance with, GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to our results as reported under GAAP, have important limitations as analytical tools, and our use of these terms may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation. 
 
 We define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 
 EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, and certain other items. 

Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage Adjusted EBITDA is of total revenue. 

Adjusted Cloud recurring gross margin is defined as Cloud recurring gross margin, as adjusted to exclude share-based compensation and related employer taxes, and certain other items, as a percentage of total Cloud recurring revenue. 

Adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit, as adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and certain other items. 

Adjusted operating profit margin is determined by calculating the percentage Adjusted operating profit is of total revenue. 

Adjusted net income is defined as net (loss) income, as adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and certain other items, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes. 

Adjusted net profit margin is determined by calculating the percentage Adjusted net income is of total revenue. 

Adjusted diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. When adjusted net income is positive, diluted weighted average shares outstanding incorporate the effect of dilutive equity instruments. 

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted to exclude capital expenditures. 

Percentage change in revenue, including total revenue and revenue by solution, on a constant currency basis is calculated by applying the average foreign exchange rate in effect during the comparable prior period. 

Dayforce recurring revenue per customer is an indicator of the average size of Dayforce recurring revenue customers. To calculate Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, we start with Dayforce recurring revenue on a constant currency basis by applying the same exchange rate to all comparable periods for the trailing twelve months and excludes float revenue, and Ascender, ADAM HCM, and eloomi revenue. This amount is divided by the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of the trailing twelve month period, excluding Ascender, ADAM HCM, and eloomi. We have not reconciled the Dayforce recurring revenue per customer because there is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and pension obligations. We seek to minimize or to manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities. These market risks may be amplified by events and factors surrounding global events. We do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on market fluctuations, nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying exposures. 
 Foreign Currency Risk . Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Canadian Dollar. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has historically been partially hedged as our foreign currency denominated inflows create a natural hedge against our foreign currency denominated expenses. Accordingly, our results of operations and cash flows were not materially affected by fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, and we believe that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates or an inability to access foreign funds would not materially affect our ability to meet our operational needs or result in a material foreign currency loss in the future. Due to the relative size of our international operations to date, we have not instituted an active hedging program. We expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term, and we are monitoring the foreign currency exposure to determine if we should begin a hedging program. 
 Interest Rate Risk . Our operating results and financial condition are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates, primarily in relation to: (1) our customer funds market valuation and float revenue derived therefrom, (2) our debt and the interest paid on such, and (3) our cash and equivalents and the interest income earned on these balances. Collectively, we do not believe that a change in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. 
 In certain jurisdictions, we collect funds for payment of payroll and taxes; temporarily hold such funds in segregated accounts until payment is due; remit the funds to the customers employees and appropriate taxing authority; file federal, state and local tax returns; and handle related regulatory correspondence and amendments. We invest the customer funds in high- quality bank deposits, money market mutual funds, commercial paper or collateralized short-term investments. We may also invest these funds in government securities, as well as highly rated asset-backed, mortgage-backed, corporate, and bank securities. 
 We have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations, either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities, would reduce our average customer fund balances and float revenue. Based on current market conditions, portfolio composition and investment practices, a 100 basis point decrease in market investment rates would result in approximately 26 million decrease in float revenue over the ensuing twelve month period. There are no incremental costs of revenue associated with changes in float revenue. 
 We pay floating rates of interest on our 2024 Term Debt and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. The interest paid on these borrowings will fluctuate up or down in relation to changes in market interest rates. A 100 basis point decrease in the applicable reference rates would result in approximately 6 million decrease in our interest expense over the ensuring twelve-month period. Please refer to Part I, Item 1. Note 9, "Debt" for additional information. 
 We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. 
 However, because we classify our securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be unrecoverable. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. Please refer to Part I, Item 1. Note 5, "Customer Funds" for additional information.

Table of Contents 

 Pension Obligation Risk . We provide a pension plan for certain current and former U.S. employees that closed to new participants on January 2, 1995. In 2007, the U.S. pension plan was amended (1) to exclude from further participation any participant or former participant who was not employed by us or another participating employer on January 1, 2008, (2) to discontinue participant contributions, and (3) to freeze the accrual of additional benefits as of December 31, 2007. With an effective date of September 30, 2024, the pension plan was terminated. In applying relevant accounting policies, we have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, and health care cost trends. The cost of pension benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions, and benefit experience. The effective discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations in 2023 ranged from 4.52 to 4.65 . The expected rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2024 is 4.80 . 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on that evaluation, and as a result of the GITC Material Weakness identified as part of the 2023 annual evaluation and defined below, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level. The GITC Material Weakness continues to be the sole material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In light of the GITC Material Weakness, management performed additional analyses and other procedures, and has concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with GAAP. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K , we identified a material weakness with respect to ineffective general information technology controls GITCs related to user access and change management over the information technology ("IT") systems supporting our Canada trust and Powerpay revenue processes (the GITC Material Weakness ). 
 The GITC Material Weakness was primarily due to ineffective reporting lines necessary to plan, execute, control, and periodically assess our IT activities. Specifically, we did not effectively design control activities to restrict technology access rights to authorized users commensurate with their job responsibilities; we did not have an effective information and communication process that identified and assessed the controls necessary to ensure the reliability of information used in financial reporting; and we lacked effective ongoing evaluations of whether GITCs are present and functioning. 
 Management s Plan to Remediate the Identified Material Weakness 
 We have continued to make progress on our efforts to remediate the GITC Material Weakness. These remediation activities include enhanced risk assessments; modified reporting lines of key control owners; improved training, and additional resources, focused on the design, implementation, operation, and documentation of GITCs; and the implementation of improved monitoring procedures, stronger user access controls, and greater segregation of duties in certain areas around our Canada trust and Powerpay revenue processes. 
 Management believes that the new and improved resources, procedures, and controls discussed above will provide an appropriate and prompt remediation of the GITC Material Weakness. However, it will not be considered fully remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively, which we expect to occur in connection with our annual audit covering the year ended December 31, 2024. 
 45 | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q 

Table of Contents 

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 With the exception of the on-going remediation activities in response to the GITC Material Weakness identified above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations, including employment-related disputes, contract disputes, disputes with our competitors, intellectual property disputes, government audits and proceedings, customer disputes, and tort claims. In some proceedings, the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief, which, if granted, would require substantial expenditures on our part. 
 Some of these matters raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including the facts and circumstances of each particular action, and the jurisdiction, forum, and law under which each action is proceeding. Because of these complexities, final disposition of some of these proceedings may not occur for several years. As such, we are not always able to estimate the amount of our possible future liabilities, if any. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, we believe would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or liquidity. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, such as Part I, Item 2. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", the reader should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K . There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. of our 2023 Form 10-K , with the exception of the items listed below. 
 The price of our common stock may be volatile, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. 
 The market price and volume of our common stock trading has experienced, and may continue to experience, wide fluctuations and volatility. Factors that may impact our performance and market price include those discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section of this Form 10-Q, as well as the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. of our 2023 Form 10-K , and others such as: market factors such as economic recession or monetary policy actions by central banking authorities, announcement or filing with the SEC by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans or commercial relationships as well as new services; any major change in our senior management or board of directors; sales, or anticipated sales, of our stock, including sales by our officers, directors, and significant stockholders; repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program or the decision to terminate or suspend any repurchases; issuance of new, negative, or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations or estimates; investor perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our customers operate; and threatened or actual litigation and governmental investigations. 
 These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities. Securities litigation against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, could result in substantial costs, damage to our reputation, and divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our share repurchase program may increase the volatility of the market price of our stock and adversely affect our liquidity. Further, we may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase program. 
 In July 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 500 million of our issued and outstanding common stock. The authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares, there is no expiration date for the authorization, and the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time and for any reason. Any future announcement of a termination or suspension of the program, or our decision not to utilize the full authorized repurchase amount under the program, may reduce investor confidence and/or result in a decrease in the market price of our shares. 
 The existence of the repurchase program could cause our stock price to trade higher than it otherwise would and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. The repurchase program may not enhance long-term stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares. Additionally, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the number or amount of shares we may ultimately repurchase pursuant to the program.

 Repurchasing our common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, repayment of debt, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes. The actual timing, number, and value of shares repurchased will depend on various factors, including the market price of our common stock, trading volume, general market conditions, and other corporate and economic considerations.
