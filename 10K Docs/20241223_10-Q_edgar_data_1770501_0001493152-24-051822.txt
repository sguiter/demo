CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and the Company s future results. These statements
are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs
and assumptions of the Company s management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, 
 goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, 
 estimates, continues, could, would, should, will, 
 may, variations of such words, and similar expressions of a forward-looking nature are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of the Company s future financial performance, the Company s
anticipated growth and potential in its business, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.
Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions
that are difficult to predict, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report and elsewhere
herein. The forward-looking information contained in this Quarterly Report is generally located under the heading Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations but may be found in other locations as well. 

Therefore,
actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, and readers are cautioned
not to place undue reliance upon such statements in making an investment decision. The Company disclaims any obligation to update factors
or to announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments. 

In
addition, statements such as we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject.
These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report and, although we believe such information
forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to
indicate that we have conducted a thorough inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements
are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements
prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements,
you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives
and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. You should carefully read the factors set forth in the Risk Factors section
of this Quarterly Report and other cautionary statements made throughout this Quarterly Report, and you should interpret such factors
and cautionary statements as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever appearing in this Quarterly Report. We undertake
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed
circumstances, or otherwise, unless required by law. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable
to us or persons acting on our behalf. 

Although
we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable, all forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
and our projections and expectations may be incorrect. The factors that may affect our expectations regarding our operations include,
among others, the following: 

our
 projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate; 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements; 

the
 level of our revenues, which depends in part on the popularity of concerts and events held at our venues, the performance of the
 artists who perform at our venue, and our ability to attract such concerts and events; 

the
 costs and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, as well as our ability to promote our brands, future investments in our business,
 our anticipated capital expenditures, and our estimates regarding our capital requirements, our ability to compete effectively with
 existing competitors and new market entrants; 

the
 level of our capital expenditures and other investments; 

general
 economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which our restaurants and venues operate; 

general
 instability of economic and political conditions in the United States, including inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations,
 slowdown or recession, and escalating geopolitical tensions and the potential impact of economic conditions, including inflation
 and rising interest rates, on our liquidity, operations, and personnel; 

2 

our
 ability to raise financing in the future and to obtain additional capital on terms that are favorable to us or at all; 

the
 demand for sponsorship and firepit suite arrangements at our venues and amphitheaters; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the potential for us to incur substantial costs from lawsuits to enforce
 or protect our intellectual property rights; 

the
 effect of any postponements or cancellations by third parties or the Company of scheduled events, whether as a result of a public
 health emergency due to operational challenges and other health and safety concerns or otherwise; 

our
 reliance on third parties; 

our
 ability to expand our organization to accommodate potential growth and our ability to retain and attract key personnel; 

compliance
 with government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety regulations and liabilities thereunder; 

the
 performance of the Company s information technology systems and its ability to maintain data security; 

compliance
 with government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety regulations and liabilities thereunder; 

the
 increased expenses associated with being a public company; and 

other
 risks described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

New
factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties
described in this Quarterly Report or any other filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC occur, or
should the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements we make herein and therein prove incorrect, our actual results and plans
could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference within it with the understanding that our actual future results,
performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

NOTE
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern. As of the issuance of these financials, management has concluded there is not substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

The
Company had an accumulated deficit of 
and 
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively and incurred net losses of 
and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. These conditions raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern; however, based on management s plan, as described below, such substantial doubt has been
alleviated. The Company believes that cash on hand, and the improved profitability over the next twelve months from the operating
entities in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Gainesville, Georgia, along with full season of operations of Ford Amphitheater in 2025,
as well as additional capital raising and debt financing so far in 2024, and the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering in
November 2024, will allow the Company to continue its business operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to execute on
these plans as laid out above. 

The
Company s continued implementation of its business plan to add additional locations is dependent on its future engagement in strategic
locations, real estate transactions, capital raising, and debt financing. If the Company is unable to enter into strategic transactions,
the Company may be required to delay its business plan implementation for future expansion, which would have a material adverse impact
on the Company s growth plan.

Venue
Ownership 

Venu
primarily generates revenue through restaurant operations, event rentals, and hosting concerts and events. Our business involves developing,
owning and operating the following types of venues and entertainment spaces: 

Music
Halls Music halls are indoor, intimate music and event venues that can accommodate up to approximately 1,400 guests. This
venue category includes our Bourbon Brothers Presents venues, which are designed to host approximately 1,400 concertgoers at general
admission concerts featuring national-touring artists or to seat between 500 and 700 guests at more intimate events such as concerts
featuring tribute bands or dueling pianos, corporate functions, or weddings. Our BBP music halls can quickly be transitioned from one
configuration to the next. This operational flexibility is intended to maximize our event-rental opportunities by expanding the types
of events we can host while minimizing the time it takes to stage one event to the next, allowing us, for example, to host a premier
concert one night and a wedding the following afternoon. 

30 

Amphitheaters
 Amphitheaters are typically outdoor venues that accommodate between 8,000 and 20,000 concertgoers and will primarily be operated
during the summer through fall seasons. Amphitheaters are designed with special acoustics, premium seat packages, and luxurious suites
intended to amplify guests music and entertainment experiences. Our first amphitheater venue is the Ford Amphitheater in Colorado
Springs, Colorado, which is an open-air, 8,000-person venue. In addition to lawn and stadium-style seating that allows us to offer tickets
at an array of price points, Ford Amphitheater has firepit suites that deliver premium hospitality and a more luxurious, personalized
concert experience. Each firepit suite can accommodate up to eight guests. Ford Amphitheater, which opened in August 2024, is designed
with 92 VIP firepit suites, accommodating a total of 736 VIP guests. Ford Amphitheater will primarily host concerts from May through
October each year. The amphitheaters planned for development in Oklahoma and Texas will also have firepit suites. 

Certain
entities, which own and develop Venu s venues, are not wholly owned by Venu. For example, Venu has a 10 ownership interest in
The Sunset Amphitheater, LLC (which is the owner and developer of the Ford Amphitheater) but holds a 100 voting interest. Venu anticipates
it will own 60 of Sunset Hospitality Collection, LLC (which is a company designed to own the building to lease to Roth Seafood 
Chophouse and Notes Hospitality Collection) but hold 100 of the voting interest. In addition, the Company expects to own 30 of Sunset
at Broken Arrow LLC and Sunset at Mustang Creek LLC (which, respectively, will own and operate the planned amphitheaters in Broken Arrow,
Oklahoma and the greater Oklahoma City area) while, in each case, holding a 100 voting interest. With respect to its subsidiaries that
own and develop amphitheaters, third-party members, in exchange for their capital contributions, receive an interest in the exclusive
use of a specific suite at the applicable venue and also in their capacity as equity owners receive financial interests in their pro
rata portion of a defined portion of the revenues generated by the venue for each event. Similarly, third-party members in Sunset Hospitality
Collection LLC, receive, in exchange for their capital contribution, distributions from revenues resulting from lease payments received
on the property owned by the entity. 

Restaurants
 Bourbon Brothers Smokehouse Tavern is Venu s flagship, full-service restaurant concept. BBST serves American
classics and Southern staples out of a scratch kitchen, accompanied by a selection of rare bourbons, ryes, whiskies, and local craft
beers. Venu develops its BBST restaurants and BBP music halls in close proximity to one another, which allows BBST to serve as the exclusive
caterer for BBP events. 

Fine
Dining, Hospitality, and Entertainment Campuses In May 2025, Venu expects to open Roth s Seafood Chophouse, a
fine-dining restaurant in a mixed-use development adjacent to Ford Amphitheater. Framing either side of Roth s will be two, configurable
hospitality spaces intended to be used for hosting corporate events, weddings, trade shows, conventions, and other events. Above Roth s
and in between the Notes Hospitality Collection spaces will be a top-shelf bar and lounge called Brohan s, which
will offer unobstructed views of the surrounding area Venu intends to monetize during marquee shows at Ford Amphitheater.

Business
Segment 

We
consider our restaurant and event center operations as similar, in close proximity, and have aggregated them into a single reportable
segment. Revenue from our customers is primarily derived from food and beverage F B services (our Restaurant
Operations with a portion being served contemporaneously with live entertainment during the events and concerts that we promote
and host (our Event Operations ). 

Event
Operations. The Event Operations portion of our business involves the promotion of live music and events in our owned or operated
venues, the operation and management of our venues, the creation of content from concerts and events hosted in our venues, and the provision
of management and other services to artists. Between BBP CO in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and BBP GA in Gainesville, Georgia, we promote
and hold hundreds of live music and other events each year. Our Event Operations business generated 1,104,991, or 21 , of our total
revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 3,755,113, or 28 , of our total revenue during the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

Within
our Events Operations, we generate revenues through: (i) ticket sales and fees on tickets sold directly by us or through the ticketing
business that we contract with for our events; (ii) fees collected on tickets sold by other third-party platforms, such as convenience
and order-processing fees and service charges; (iii) venue rentals, which occur for a variety of corporate and personal events; (iv)
pre-selling naming rights to our live-entertainment venues by partnering with industry-leading brands under naming-rights agreements;
and (v) sponsorship sales, which allow brands to advertise at our venues by showcasing their names and logos on a variety of sponsorship
inventory curated for each of our venues and at each event we promote and host. 

Restaurant
Operations. Revenues generated through restaurant operations included F B sales at our BBST restaurants and Notes bar (known
as Notes Eatery as of May 2024). F B sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone F B sales, along with
F B sales at BBP CO and BBP GA. Our Restaurant Operations business generated 2,740,411, or 50 , of our total revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, and 8,144,605 or 60 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in our Restaurant
Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily due to our increased revenues from our BBST CO
restaurant in 2024 and the BBST GA restaurant venue being open and fully operational during the first three quarters of 2024 while still
being under construction until June 2023. The net decrease in our Restaurant Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024
over September 30, 2023 consists of our increased revenues from our BBST CO restaurant in 2024, offset by decreased revenues at the BBST
GA venue recognizing grand opening sales above normal levels in 2023 while recognizing stabilizing revenues in 2024 and Notes Eatery
changing its operating model and hours in 2024 compared to a higher operating model in 2023. 

Amphitheater
Operations. The Amphitheater Operations began generating revenue in the third quarter of 2024 with the opening of Ford Amphitheater.
Through a subsidiary we have entered into an agreement with Anschutz Entertainment Group AEG ), AEG Presents-Rocky
Mountains, LLC, a major music and entertainment events presenter, to operate Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Within
our Amphitheater Operations, we pre-sell naming rights to our amphitheater by partnering with industry-leading brands under naming-rights
agreements. At the Ford Amphitheater, we generate net profits that are split with AEG through: (i) ticket sales, fees and rebates on
tickets for concerts and events held at Ford Amphitheater; (ii) parking fees; (iii) venue rentals, which may occur for a variety of corporate
and personal events; (iv) food and beverage sold at the shows and events; and (v) sponsorship sales, which allow brands to advertise
at our venue by showcasing their names and logos on a variety of sponsorship inventory curated for the venue and at each event we promote
and host, all of which are offset by operating expenses, artist expenses, supplies, security, utilities, insurance, overhead, and other
operating costs within our net amphitheater revenue recognition from AEG. For future amphitheater locations we expect to open we anticipate
entering into contractual arrangements with third party operators having terms similar to those with AEG. Our Amphitheater Operations
generated net revenues of 1,606,573 or 30 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 12 of our total revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Financial 

Private
Equity Offerings 

Since
our formation in 2017, we have funded our operations, in part, through proceeds from private sales of our equity securities. 

32 

During
the first nine months of 2024, we raised 31,693,410 in a private offering of our Common Stock. We have used, and expect to use, the
proceeds of that offering primarily to fund marketing, recruitment and development of staff, pre-opening costs for Ford Amphitheater,
Roth s Seafood and Chophouse, and Notes Hospitality Collection restaurant venues in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and other working
capital needs. 

We
anticipate raising additional cash through the private sales of membership interests in certain of our subsidiary entities (including
interests in our firepit suites) at our amphitheater locations, collaborative arrangements such as owner s clubs, or a combination
thereof, to continue to fund our construction of venues. There is no assurance that any such collaborative arrangement will be entered
into or that financing will be available to us when needed in order to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms
acceptable to us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, we may be forced to curtail operations or revise the timeline
of our business plan.

Ford
Amphitheater in Colorado Springs opened August 9, 2024. A fine-dining restaurant, Roth s Seafood and Chophouse, and a rooftop bar,
Brohan s, along with premier event rental space and suites known as Notes Hospitality Collection surrounding that development,
are expected to open in May 2025. Even though this amphitheater had a shortened 2024 season, it positively impacted Venu s financial
performance in 2024. 

Revenue 

Total
revenue increased 1,540,596 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.
Total revenue increased 4,881,381 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

35 

With
respect to the increase in revenue generated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods
in 2023, the increase was primarily attributable to the opening of Ford Amphitheater in August 2024. The opening of Ford Amphitheater
in August 2024, and the holding of 17 events through September 30, 2024, was the primary factor that contributed to the increase in our
event center ticket and fee revenue during the 2024 period, as well as the increase in our sponsorship revenue as we recognized revenues
through our sponsorship agreement for that venue. BBST CO and BBP CO experienced increased revenues for both the three and nine months
of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, along with our BBST GA restaurant and BBP GA venue being open and fully operational
during the first three quarters of 2024 while still being under construction until June 2023. The net decrease in our Restaurant Operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over September 30, 2023 included decreased revenues at the BBST GA venue recognizing grand
opening sales above normal levels in 2023 while recognizing stabilizing revenues in 2024 and Notes Eatery changing its operating model
and hours in 2024 compared to a higher operating model in 2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

Food
and Beverage Costs. Our F B costs decreased (58,848) and increased 371,483 during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease
in costs was aligned with the decrease in our restaurant including food and beverage revenue for the same time period at the BBST GA
location. This location specifically had elevated sales during the same period in 2023 due to its grand opening period. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, the cost increases were primarily driven by our increase in overall sales
volumes for the first nine months of the year, along with increased raw ingredient and food costs due to inflation. 

Event
Center Costs. The costs attributed to our event centers increased 27,952 and 1,092,943 during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. In each case, this was primarily due to the added costs of
operating our BBP GA venue in Gainesville, Georgia as it was open for a full nine months in 2024 when compared to 2023 as it opened in
June 2023. 

Labor
Costs. Our labor costs decreased (35,665) and increased 786,490 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Management believes the decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the same period in the prior year occurred because the interim period in 2023 included additional labor costs to train and employ
the individuals who operate our BBST GA and BBP GA restaurant and venue following their grand openings in June 2023. The increase in
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily inflation driven with higher wages. 

Rent
Costs. Our rent costs decreased (29,840) and increased 111,906 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
as compared to the same periods in the prior year. In regards to the decrease in rent expense for the three months ended September 30,
2024, this was primarily due to Notes Eatery rent expenses being eliminated in consolidations since it began to be consolidated the Company s
financials in late June 2024. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this was primarily due to the added costs of
operating and paying rent costs for our BBST GA and BBP GA restaurant and venue in Gainesville, Georgia beginning in June 2023. 

Operating
Expenses. Our operating expenses increased 2,020,622 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period
in the prior year, and increased 14,334,522 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior
year. In each case, our increases in operating expenses were primarily the result of along with equity-based compensation that was issued
for services and non-cash financing and incurring additional expenses related to our efforts to expand the Company s growth to
the additional states of Oklahoma and Texas, which included expenses such as travel, business development, and staff recruitment and
development along with pre-opening expenses of Ford Amphitheater in 2024.. Our general and administrative expenses are also included
in operating expenses and consist primarily of expenditures related to compensation, legal, auditing and tax, other professional services,
and general operating expenses. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Costs. Our depreciation and amortization costs increased 538,365 during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to the same period in the prior year, and increased 1,040,003 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to the same period in the prior year. The increases in depreciation and amortization costs during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the same periods the prior year was primarily attributable to our BBST GA and BBP GA restaurant and venue being
open and operational during the first three quarters of 2024 but not until late in the second quarter of 2023, along with Ford Amphitheater
opening in late third quarter of 2024. 

Other
Expense 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other expense totaled 0 and 0, respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other expense totaled 2,500,000 and 0, respectively. This increase for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the financing expense the Company recognized on a convertible promissory note issued
in January 2024. 

36 

Interest
Expense 

We
had net interest expense of approximately 1,162,663 and 92,252 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
This increase in 2024 was primarily due to the addition of the mortgage on the BBST GA and BBP GA properties, along with the amortization
of the debt discount fees on the convertible debt. 

We
had net interest expense of approximately 2,717,849 and 222,812 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
which is primarily due to the addition of the mortgage on the BBSTGA and BBP properties, along with the amortization of the debt discount
fees on the convertible debt. 

(Loss)
Gain on Sale of Investments, net 

During
the 2023 fiscal year, we realized a loss on the sale of investments of 75,603, resulting from the sale of our 20 interest in War Hippies,
LLC in December 2023. 

Other
Income

fee paid by Roth Industries to Venu is in the form of a royalty equal to 10,000 per month, which did not change from 2023 to 2024. Accordingly,
during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Roth Industries paid Venu 90,000 in royalty payments.

Factors
that May Influence Future Results of Operations 

Impact
of Macroeconomic Conditions 

We
continue to monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressure, potential for recession, instability of
capital markets, consumer-spending habits, costs of goods, changes to fiscal and monetary policies, interest rate fluctuations, access
to capital, the favorability of lending terms, prolonged supply-chain constraints, and geopolitical trends, on all aspects of our business,
including how those factors may impact our operations, workforce, suppliers, ability to raise additional capital to fund operating and
capital expenditures, sales, and profitability. 

The
extent of the impact of these factors on our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be confidently
predicted at this time. To date, these factors have not had a material impact to our results of our operations or development efforts.
However, if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or there are unforeseen developments, our results of operations, financial condition,
and cash flows may be adversely affected. 

Rising
Interest Rates 

A
prevailing trend that has impacted our business is rising and steadily high interest rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has
increased interest rates a total of eleven times, with the last hike occurring in July 2023 when target interest rates reached a range
of 5.25 to 5.50 , with a benchmark rate at about 5.4 , the highest level in more than two decades. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve
lowered the benchmark rate by 50 basis points, reducing the rate to the range of 4.75 to 5.00 . Although the Federal Reserve has indicated
that additional rate reductions could occur in the remainder of 2024 and in 2025, the timing and extent of those rate cuts are uncertain.
Although Venu was fortunate to have access to attractive debt capital and to purchase land to be developed into entertainment campuses
on favorable terms by negotiating with various municipalities and forming public-private partnerships, had those lending opportunities
not been available, volatility in interest rates would have increased the cost of borrowing and required us to agree to loan terms that
were less favorable for borrowers. Furthermore, interest-rate increases may reduce the affordability of our land-development projects
due to increased debt-servicing costs. Volatility in interest rates affect the demand for, and price of real estate. A rise in interest
rates increases the cost while lowering the availability of debt financing. Increased borrowing costs would drive the costs of our development
projects and inflate our project budgets. 

37 

Inflation 

Another
trend that impacted our business throughout 2023 and that has continued to impact our business during 2024 has been the increase in inflation
nationwide, which has gone hand in hand with the rising interest rate environment. With respect to project execution, inflation increased
the cost of building materials and labor types, creating upward pressure on the costs of constructing and developing our event venues.
Third parties that we contracted with, such as developers and contractors, were impacted by rising inflation rates and the corresponding
rise in the costs of goods and services used in their businesses. Their ability to do business with us could be impacted by steadily
high rates of interest and inflation, which could impact our profitability. 

In
addition to impacting our project construction and development costs, inflation also lead to higher costs for ingredients, supplies,
utilities, and labor, all of which are essential components of operating restaurants and venues. While we were able to offset some of
those costs by adjusting menu prices at our restaurants, we had to balance those adjustments with consumer sentiment to ensure that we
did not deter customers from dining with us and in turn impact our overall sales volume. Inflation also impacts consumer-spending habits.
As the costs of everyday goods and services rise, customers may become more hesitant to spend discretionary funds on restaurant dining. 

We
continue to monitor the impacts of high interest rates and inflation on our business and will continue to proactively seek cost-saving
measures, negotiate with municipalities to purchase land without being burdened by increased borrowing costs and unfavorable lending
terms. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing our business plan of market expansion, growing our staff, raising capital,
opening and operating our restaurants and event venues in Colorado and Georgia and planning venues in new markets, such as Oklahoma and
Texas, growing into additional markets, while closing on our initial public offering that closed subsequent to period end on November
29, 2024. While our primary focus is building venues in these new markets which drives our balance sheet, our secondary focus is the
development agreements in new markets. While we undergo the construction of these venues in 2025 in Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas, we
do not anticipate operational profits until we open and operate this new collection of venues. 

When
comparing our year-after-year interim financials, we had an accumulated deficit of 41,073,711 and 17,021,453 as of September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively, with cash flows provided by (used in) operations of 13,336,007 and (6,518,214) as of the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we experienced an increase in net loss from (2,807,913) to (4,527,472) for
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and we experienced an increase in net loss from
 (8,244,731) to (25,612,656) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The Company believes
the majority of net loss in the 2024 period was largely due to our efforts to developing our business plan, growing our staff, raising
capital, and opening and operating our restaurants and event venues in Colorado and Georgia, pre-opening expenses related to Ford Amphitheater,
and planning venues in new markets, such as Oklahoma and Texas, along with equity based compensation that was issued for services and
non-cash financing. 

In
addition, the Company grew its property and equipment, net, to 125,756,511 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 57,737,763 as of December
31, 2023, which represents an increase of 118 , over the nine-month period. 

During
the first nine months of 2024, we closed a private placement offering in which we sold 3,169,341 shares of Common Stock and received
gross proceeds of 31,693,410. 

On
January 17, 2024, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note (the Note with KWO, LLC KWO ),
that accrues interest at 8.75 per annum, for draws of up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 to occur between March 2024 to May 2024 to be
used towards Sunset Colorado construction. The outstanding balance of the Note as of September 30, 2024, was 10,000,000. Interest is
to be paid monthly and the maturity date is one year from the date of the first draw. The first draw occurred on March 1, 2024, in the
amount of 3,860,582.40, and the maturity date of the Note s principal balance is March 1, 2025. The second and third draws occurred
on April 10, 2024, in the amount of 3,738,030.37, and on May 10, 2024, in the amount of 2,401,387.23. At any time during the period
commencing June 1, 2024, and continuing until the date on which the Note is paid in full, KWO may convert the outstanding Note into Company
shares of equivalent value, and the Company shares are deemed to have a fixed value of 10 per share. 

38 

Kevin
O Neil, a minority stockholder of Venu and owner of the holder of the Note, KWO, along with Mr. JW Roth, both personally guarantee
the Note at a fee equal to 1 of the promissory note balance. The holder of the Note financed the asset purchase and paid the draw to
the Ford Amphitheater general contractor directly thus became a personal guarantor to the Note. The Company recognized a debt discount
for the personal guarantee fee of 100,000 with 25,000 and 58,333 expensed to interest expense in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, with the remaining debt discount to be expensed to interest expense over the life of the Note. As consideration of the personal
guarantee fee, the Company granted a three-year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of Venu common stock at 10 per share for both the
holder and Mr. Roth, with the Company recognizing a debt discount of 3,000,140 with 750,034 and 1,750,082 expensed to interest expense
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, with the remaining to be expensed over the life of the Note. In accordance with
ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging, the warrants were recorded at relative fair value within stockholder s equity in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet. A loan origination fee of 100,000 is recognized as debt discount with 25,000 and 58,333 expensed to interest
expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, with the remaining to be expensed over the life of the Note. The Company
leased KWO a suite at the Ford Amphitheater with a fair market value of 200,000 without additional payment or consideration, and is
subject to and consistent with the schedule, rights, terms and conditions applicable to other suites offered to the public. The Company
treated this leased suite as a debt discount with 50,000 and 116,666 expensed to interest expense in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, with the remining to be expensed over the life of the Note. The convertible debt balance of 10,000,000, net by the
cumulative debt discounts of 1,416,725, agrees to the net of 8,583,275 shown as convertible debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet. In addition, KWO in a related agreement, purchased 500,000 shares of stock from Mr. Roth at a discount as part of this transaction.
Per ASC paragraph 718-10-15-4, the economic interest holder makes a capital contribution to the reporting entity, and the reporting entity
makes a share-based payment to its grantee in exchange for goods or services provided to the reporting entity. In the Company s
instance, Mr. Roth paid the holder on behalf of the Company. The Company recognized a 0 and 2,500,000 charge in other expense and additional
paid in capital related to the exchange for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as Mr. Roth completed this stock transaction
on behalf of the Company for KWO completing the Note transaction. 

We
believe that (i) cash on hand, (ii) improved profitability through the next twelve months from operating venues and restaurants in Colorado
Springs, Colorado and Gainesville, Georgia, (iii) opening Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, Colorado in the third quarter of 2024
and the net revenues expected to be generated by that project, (iv) the net cash received from our initial public offering that closed
on November 29, 2024 offering, and (v) additional capital raising efforts either at the parent corporation level or through sales of
interests in our subsidiaries that own real estate assets related to our amphitheater projects (i.e., our firepit suite related sales
and capital raising efforts), and debt financing , will allow us to continue our business operations. Our ability to continue implementing
our business plan to add new locations to our portfolio for the purpose of developing entertainment campuses depends on our future engagement
in strategic locations, real-estate transactions, capital raising, and debt financing.

Significant
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Management
bases these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable based on
information presently available. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 

Significant
estimates made by management include, but are not limited to: economic lives of leased assets; impairment assessment of long-lived assets;
depreciable lives of property, plant, and equipment; useful lives of intangible assets; accruals for contingencies including tax contingencies;
valuation allowances for deferred income-tax assets; estimates of fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in business
combinations; and estimates of fair value used in the private stock valuations used for equity-based compensation and warrants. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires us to allocate the transaction price received from our customers to
separate and distinct performance obligations and to recognize revenue upon the satisfaction of our performance obligations. We recognize
revenue from our sale to customers of F B products at our restaurants when the F B products are transferred to the customer.
We recognize revenue from the rental of our venues and from tickets and related fees for concerts or shows performed at our venues when
the event, concert, or show occurs. We recognize naming rights and sponsorship revenue over the life of the naming rights and sponsorship
agreements. 

We
record amounts collected prior to the event as deferred revenue until the event occurs. We record amounts collected from our sponsorship
agreements, which do not relate to a single event, as deferred revenue and recognize those amounts over the term of the agreements as
the sponsorship benefits are provided to our sponsors. 

The
Company contracted with a subsidiary of the Anschutz Entertainment Group AEG ), AEG Presents-Rocky Mountains, LLC,
a major music and entertainment events presenter, to operate Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which opened in August
2024. Within our Amphitheater Operations, we pre-sell naming rights to our amphitheater by partnering with industry-leading brands under
naming-rights agreements. We generate net profits that are split with AEG through: (i) ticket sales, fees and rebates on tickets for
concerts and events held at Ford Amphitheater; (ii) parking fees; (iii) venue rentals, which may occur for a variety of corporate and
personal events; (iv) food and beverage sold at the shows and events; and (v) sponsorship sales, which allow brands to advertise at our
venue by showcasing their names and logos on a variety of sponsorship inventory curated for the venue and at each event we promote and
host, all of which are offset by operating expenses, artist expenses, supplies, security, utilities, insurance, overhead, etc. within
our net amphitheater revenue recognition from AEG. 

Investments
in Related Parties 

We
have non-controlling interest investments in related parties. We account for certain of our investments in related parties using a practical
expedient to measure those investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with ASC 321, Investments
 Equity Securities ; ASC 325, Investments Other ; ASC 810, Consolidation ; and ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement .
Our investments in related parties are initially recognized at cost, and any income or loss resulting from such investments are recognized
on our consolidated statements of operations, net of operating expenses. The carrying value of our related-party investments are assessed
for indicators or impairment at each balance-sheet date, such that each investment is derecognized upon the sale or impairment of our
interest in the investment. See Non-controlling Interest and Variable Interest Entities for further discussions of the
entities that are majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities. Investments for which the Company exercises significant
influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. 

We
had one investment that we accounted for using the equity method described in ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint
Ventures , prior to disposing of that investment on December 31, 2023. Pursuant to that accounting method, we initially recorded the
investment as an asset on the balance sheet at its initial cost and then adjusted the investment each reporting period through the income
statement for the income or loss for our proportionate share of the investment. 

We
own 550,000 preferred units, or 2 , of Roth Industries, of which JW Roth, the founder, manager, and chairman, is Venu s chairman
and chief executive officer. Our officers and directors are also minority equity owners of Roth Industries. We currently account for
our investment in Roth Industries using ASC 325, Investments Other . 

40 

Leases 

We
account for our leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases , pursuant to which our leases are classified as either operating or
financing leases and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting
fixed lease payments over the lease term, including any renewal options that are likely to be exercised, at the rate set forth or implied
in the lease. In calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability, we elect to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted
under ASC 842. As an accounting-policy election, we exclude short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less and expense payments
on those short-term leases as they are made. 

Business
Combinations 

On
June 26, 2024, Notes Live Real Estate, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Venu, purchased 100 of the membership units of 13141 BP, LLC
from its members for an aggregate purchase price of 2,761,000, which Venu paid to the members on a pro-rata basis through the issuance
of 276,100 shares of Common Stock, valued at their current fair market value of 10.00 per share. 

Warrants 

On
a rolling basis from July 2021 through January 2022, we issued lenders an aggregate of 3,775,000 in convertible promissory notes (the
 July 2021 Notes and 377,500 warrants (exercisable for a three-year term from their date of issuance), which by
their original terms are exercisable at the option of the holder to purchase non-voting units of B Entertainment LLC for 2.50 per share
(and after our conversion to a corporation in April 2022, and after giving effect to subsequent forward-stock splits, are exercisable
to acquire shares of Class B Non-Voting Common Stock for 10.00 per share) prior to the warrants expiration. We accounted for
the warrants in accordance with ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging , pursuant to which the warrants were recorded at relative
fair value within stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted a total of 2,285,750 warrants, consisting of 1,285,750 warrants granted to employees
and directors and 1,000,000 warrants granted as part of a convertible promissory note. As of September 30, 2024, there was a total of
3,303,829 warrants exercisable with an aggregate intrinsic value of 14,564,986. For the total warrants outstanding of 4,901,458 as of
September 30, 2024, the aggregate intrinsic value was 20,352,758. 

As
of September 30, 2024, there was 3,943,633 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested warrants. The equity-based compensation
cost, related to warrants included as a charge to operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, was 671,819,
 10,927,326, 89,374 and 273,380 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.03 years. 

Non-controlling
Interest and Variable Interest Entities 

The
non-controlling interest NCI represents capital contributions and distributions, income and loss attributable
to the owners of less than wholly owned consolidated entities and are reported in equity. NCIs are evaluated by the Company and are shown
as permanent equity. Net income (loss) attributable to NCIs reflects the portion of the net income (loss) of consolidated entities applicable
to the NCI shareholders in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net income (loss) attributable to NCIs
is classified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of consolidated net income (loss) and deducted from total consolidated
net income (loss) to arrive at the net income (loss) attributable to the Company. The Company has
evaluated its investments in unconsolidated entities in order to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities VIEs ).
The Company monitors these investments and, to the extent it has determined that it owns a majority of the controlling class of securities
of a particular entity, analyzes the entity for potential consolidation. The Company will continually analyze investments, including
when there is a reconsideration event, to determine whether such investments are VIEs and whether such VIE should be consolidated. These
analyses require considerable judgment in determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE and could result in the consolidation of an entity
that would otherwise not have been consolidated or the non-consolidation of an entity that would have otherwise been consolidated. 

The
Company accounts for the change in its ownership interest while it retains its controlling financial interest in its majority-owned subsidiaries
or VIEs as equity transactions. The carrying value of the NCI should be adjusted to reflect the change in the Company s ownership
interest in the subsidiary, and differences between the fair value of the consideration received and the amount by which the NCI is adjusted
should be recognized in equity attributable to the Company. This may be shown as NCI and as additional paid in capital to the Company
when combined agree to the non-controlling issuance of shares as shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Change in Stockholders 
Equity. 

If
a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary results in a loss of control or deconsolidation, any retained ownership interests
are remeasured with the gain or loss reported to net earnings. These may be majority-owned subsidiaries or variable interest entities
that the Company has 100 voting control of. 

41 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as a part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, we did not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements during any of the periods presented. 

Stockholders 
Equity 

The
Company had two membership classes of units while it was a limited liability company: Class A Voting and Class B Non-Voting Units. Upon
the Company s conversion on April 6, 2022 from a Colorado limited liability company to a Colorado C corporation, the Company s
Class A Voting Units became its Class A Common Stock, and the Class B Non-Voting Units became its Class B Non-Voting Common Stock. 

On
October 25, 2022, Venu amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of its capital stock authorized for issuance,
change the voting rights of its Class A Common Stock, and add its Class C Common Stock as a class of stock. 

On
August 7, 2023, Venu allowed its shareholders to exchange their shares of Class A Common Stock into shares of Class C Common Stock on
a 1-for-25 basis and to convert their shares of Class B Non-Voting Common Stock into shares of Class C Common Stock on a 1-for-1 basis.
The Company has 76,245 shares of treasury stock that it acquired through the acquisition of HIA. 

On
November 3, 2023, Venu amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of its capital stock authorized for issuance
and to effect a 5-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of its Class C Common Stock. . On that same date, Venu
also began a private placement offering of its shares of Class C Common Stock for 10.00 per share, which later became an offering of
Common Stock following Venu s one-for-one conversion of Class C Common Stock into Common Stock in September 2024. In connection
with that offering, Venu issued 3,507,591 shares of Common Stock, including 3,169,341 shares during the nine months ended September 30,
2024. Venu also issued 700,000 shares of Class C Common Stock as payment for services to Sunshine Advisors, LLC, an outside consultant. 

On
November 15, 2023, Venu amended its Articles of Incorporation to effect a 5-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares
of its Class B Non-Voting Common Stock. 

On
March 5, 2024, Venu and its Class C Common Stock shareholders authorized the creation and issuance of up to 60,000,000 shares of Class
D Common Stock. Venu amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of its capital stock authorized for issuance
and to add its Class D Common Stock as a class of stock. At that time, Venu allowed shares of Class B Non-Voting Common Stock and of
Class C Common Stock to be exchanged for shares of Class D Common Stock on a 1-for-1 basis. 

On
September 6, 2024, Venu amended and restated is Articles of Incorporation to change its legal name to Venu Holding Corporation 
and cause all outstanding shares of its previously outstanding Class C Common Stock and Class D Common Stock to be converted on a one-for-one
basis to shares of Common Stock. As of the filing of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Company s
authorized capital does not include Class A Voting Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 383,656 shares of Class B
Non-Voting Common Stock and 35,914,923 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. 

Except
for any differences in voting privileges or in the contractual rights or limitations assigned or afforded to a specific series of stock
in connection with a merger, acquisition, or strategic transaction, the shares of Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock have
the same preferences, limitations, and relative rights. Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock
held of record by such holder on all matters on which shareholders generally are entitled to vote. Except as required by law, holders
of the Class B Non-Voting Common Stock have no voting power with respect to their shares of Class B Non-Voting Common Stock, and the
shares of Class B Non-Voting Common Stock are not entitled to vote on any matter submitted to the shareholders. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required
under this item. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

In
April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS
Act provides that an emerging growth company (an EGC may take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. As an EGC under the JOBS Act, the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act allows us to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that
have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an EGC, or (ii) affirmatively
and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be
comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public-company effective dates. 

42 

Other
exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for EGCs include presentation of only two years of audited financial
statements in a registration statement for an initial public offering, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor s
report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, an exemption from any requirement
that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, along with less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation
arrangements. We plan to take advantage of these reduced disclosure requirements and exemptions until we are no longer considered an
EGC.

 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act and are therefore subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. As a smaller reporting company, pursuant to Item
305(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item 3. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)) and concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We had limited accounting
and finance personnel which impacted our ability to properly segregate duties relating to the Company s internal controls over
financial reporting. In addition, the Company s financial close process was not sufficient. While we have processes to identify
and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to continue to enhance our systems, processes and human capital resources
with respect to our accounting and finance functions The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time with the
addition of experienced accounting and finance employees and, where necessary, external consultants, and with enhanced accounting systems
and financial close processes. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management has identified material weakness
in internal controls as described above. We have commenced remediation of the above discussed material weaknesses in that we grew our
accounting staff over 100 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. We will continue to evaluate
our accounting and finance staffing needs as well as make planned enhancements to our systems and improvements to our financial reporting
processes. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

ITEM
1. LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS. 

From
time to time, the Company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are
not engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse impact on our financial
position or results of operations. 

On
September 26, 2023, a neighborhood association and an individual filed a complaint against Venu, Notes Live Real Estate, LLC, and the
City of Colorado Springs, Colorado, seeking to enjoin Venu s construction and operation of Ford Amphitheater based on allegations
that the venue would emit unlawful noise pollution in violation of state law, thereby harming residents in the neighborhood
near the property where Ford Amphitheater is being constructed. Venu filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit based on its belief that it
had complied with all applicable codes and procedures required to obtain the City of Colorado Spring s approval to construct Ford
Amphitheater. On January 10, 2024, the El Paso County District Court dismissed the lawsuit. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal,

ITEM
1A. RISK
 FACTORS. 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this Item 1A. However, in addition to other information
set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the Risk Factors discussed in our Final Prospectus filed
with the SEC on November 27, 2024, pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a
discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the
forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial might materially adversely affect our actual business, financial condition, and operating results. 

ITEM
 2. UNREGISTERED
 SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Use
of Proceeds from Initial Public Offering 

On
November 26, 2024, we completed our initial public offering (the Offering of 1,200,000 shares Common Stock at a
public offering price of 10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of 12,000,000. We also granted the underwriters a 45-day option
to purchase up to 180,000 additional shares of Common Stock on the same terms and conditions for the purpose of covering any over-allotments
in connection with the Offering, which the underwriters exercised on November 29, 2024. The shares of Common Stock were offered and sold
pursuant to the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-281271), originally filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the Commission on August 6, 2024, and later amended (as amended, the Registration Statement ).
The Registration Statement was declared effective by the Commission on November 12, 2024. The closing of the Offering took place on November
29, 2024. Our Final Prospectus describing the terms of the offering was filed with the Commission on November 27, 2024, and is available
on the Commission s website located at http://www.sec.gov. 

We
received net proceeds of approximately 12.3 million from the Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
other offering expenses. The representative of the underwriters was ThinkEquity LLC. No payments for the foregoing expenses were
made by us to any of our officers, directors, or persons owning ten percent or more of our Common Stock, or to the associates of any
of the foregoing, or to its affiliates, other than payments in the ordinary course of business to our officers for salaries,
bonuses, and expense reimbursements. 

There
has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds as described in our Final Prospectus filed with the SEC, which includes plans
to use the net proceeds from the Offering for funding the expansion of the Company s business operations, further development of
Company services, business promotion activities, and working capital and general corporate purposes, including general market expansion
and due diligence efforts to explore the opening of new restaurant, entertainment, and music venues. The expected use of net proceeds
from the Offering represents our intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with certainty all
of the particular uses for the proceeds of the Offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we received from the Offering, and investors will be
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of our net proceeds. While we expect to use the net proceeds for
the purposes described above, the timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from
operations, the anticipated growth of our business, and the availability and terms of alternative financing sources to fund our growth.

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

On
November 3, 2023, Venu began a private placement offering of its shares of Class C Common Stock for 10.00 per share, which later became
an offering of Common Stock following Venu s one-for-one conversion of Class C Common Stock into Common Stock in September 2024.
In connection with that offering, Venu issued 3,507,591 shares of Common Stock to a total of 195 accredited investors. The shares were
offered and sold in reliance on the exemptions from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(c) promulgated
thereunder. 

In
January 2024, we issued a convertible promissory note to a single accredited investor (and between March 2024 and November 2024, a total
of 69,400 shares of Common Stock have been issued to satisfy certain obligations owed to the holder). These issuances were effected in
reliance on the exemptions from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and through the date of this Quarterly Report, we granted a total of 784,500 warrants exercisable
to purchase shares of our Common Stock. These warrants were issued for compensatory purposes (in lieu of options or other forms of equity
awards) and, in substantially all cases, vest ratably over a four-year term. To the extent warrant grants constitute an offer or sale
under the Securities Act, these warrants were granted in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of
the Securities Act. 

In
each transaction in which we relied on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder, we did not engage
in any general solicitation or advertising, and we offered the securities to a limited number of persons with whom we had pre-existing
relationships. We exercised reasonable care to ensure that the purchasers of securities were not underwriters within the meaning of the
Securities Act, including making reasonable inquiry prior to accepting any subscription, making written disclosure regarding the restricted
nature of the securities, and placing a legend on the certificates representing the shares. In each case, the offerees were provided
with a subscription agreement detailing the restrictions on transfer of the shares and eliciting their investment intent. Further, stop-transfer
restrictions were placed with our transfer agent and a restrictive legend was placed on the certificate in connection with these offerings.
In addition, sales in the transactions exempt under Rule 506(b) were made exclusively to what the Company reasonably believed were accredited
investors as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions acquired the securities
for investment purposes only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof. 

In
cases where we relied on Rule 506(c) promulgated under the Securities Act, we received information and documentation sufficient to verify
that each investor qualified as an accredited investor. 

No
underwriters were involved in the above transactions.

Personal
Guarantee Fee Agreement and Warrant Issuance 

On
December 17, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company, Sunset at McKinney, LLC, entered into a Guarantee Fee Agreement with Mr. JW Roth, the

To facilitate the closing of certain real property in the City of McKinney, Texas McKinney such property, the

of the Warrant Shares. Once the warrant is exercisable, the holders will be entitled to acquire the Warrant Shares from the Company on
or prior to December 17, 2029, at an exercise price of 10.00 per Warrant Share, as adjusted from time to time as set forth in a
