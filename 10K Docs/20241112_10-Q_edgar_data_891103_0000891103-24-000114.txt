 million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of million and million, respectively. The effective tax rates for both the three and nine-month periods in 2024 and 2023 were higher than the U.S. statutory federal rate primarily due to the effects of nondeductible stock-based compensation, state income taxes, and foreign income taxed at higher rates. These effects were partially offset by the lower tax rate on U.S. income derived from foreign sources and research credits. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 also included a benefit realized upon the conclusion of certain state income tax audits. 
 Match Group is routinely under audit by federal, state, local, and foreign authorities in the area of income tax. These audits include a review of the timing and amount of income and deductions, and the allocation of such income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The Company is open to U.S. federal audit for tax years after December 31, 2019, and returns filed in various other jurisdictions are open to examination for tax years beginning with 2014. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the final tax outcome of these matters may vary significantly from our estimates. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, were million and million, respectively. If unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 are subsequently recognized, income tax expense would be reduced by million, net of related deferred tax assets and interest. The comparable amount as of December 31, 2023 was million. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by million by September 30, 2025 due to expirations of statutes of limitations, which would reduce the income tax provision. 
 The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Accruals of interest and penalties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material. At September 30, 2024, noncurrent income taxes payable includes accrued interest and penalties of million. The comparable amount as of December 31, 2023 was million.

 million and million, respectively, and is included in Other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The cumulative downward adjustments (including impairments) to the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values through September 30, 2024 were million. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were adjustments to the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values. 
 For all equity securities without readily determinable fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has elected the measurement alternative. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, under the measurement alternative election, the Company did not identify any fair value adjustments using observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 
 Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
 Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair values of the Company s Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded. Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.

 Time deposits Short-term investments: Time deposits Total 
 Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
 The Company s non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, and right-of-use assets, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. The Company s financial assets, comprised of equity securities without readily determinable fair values, are adjusted to fair value when observable price changes are identified or an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, in connection with our decision to terminate live streaming services in our dating applications, including Plenty of Fish, and to sunset our Hakuna application, which provided live streaming primarily in Asia, we recognized impairment charges of million related to indefinite- and definite-lived intangible assets in the Match Group Asia and Evergreen Emerging segments. For certain assets with no remaining cash flow, the Company fully impaired the asset. For assets with remaining cash flows, the Company conducted discounted cash flow valuations. The Company also reclassified an indefinite-lived intangible asset with a carrying value of million to the definite-lived intangible asset category as of September 30, 2024 because the asset is no longer considered to have an indefinite life.

 Credit Facility and Term Loan 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Match Group Holdings II, LLC MG Holdings II ), is the borrower under a credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement that provides for the Credit Facility and the Term Loan. 
 On March 20, 2024, we entered into an amendment to reduce the borrowing availability under the Credit Facility from million to million and extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is the earlier of (x) March 20, 2029 and (y) the date that is days prior to the maturity date of the Term Loan or the existing senior notes due 2027, 2028, or 2029, or any new indebtedness used to refinance the Term Loan or such senior notes that matures prior to the date that is days after March 20, 2029, in each case if and only if at least million in aggregate principal amount of such debt is outstanding on such date. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of million and million, respectively. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were letters of credit of million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was million and million, respectively, of availability under the Credit Facility. The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds, which is based on MG Holdings II s consolidated net leverage ratio, was basis points as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at MG Holdings II s option, at a base rate or a term secured overnight financing rate plus an applicable adjustment Adjusted Term SOFR ), plus an

 to 1.0. 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan was million. The Term Loan bears interest at Adjusted Term SOFR plus and the applicable rate was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Term Loan matures on February 13, 2027. Interest payments are due at least quarterly through the term of the loan. The Term Loan provides for annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which, if any, is governed by the secured net leverage ratio as set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement includes covenants that would limit the ability of MG Holdings II to pay dividends, make distributions, or repurchase MG Holdings II s stock in the event MG Holdings II s consolidated net leverage ratio exceeds to 1.0, or if an event of default has occurred. The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants that limit the ability of MG Holdings II and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions. Obligations under the Credit Facility and Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain MG Holdings II wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and are also secured by the stock of certain MG Holdings II domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The Term Loan and outstanding borrowings, if any, under the Credit Facility, rank equally with each other, and have priority over the Senior Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

No such limitations were in effect at September 30, 2024.

 (a) Subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. 
 As more specifically set forth in the applicable indentures, the Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable under the following circumstances: 
 (1) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the exchange price on each applicable trading day; 
 (2) during the five -business day period after any five -consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the exchange rate on each such trading day; 
 (3) if the issuer calls the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 
 (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as further described in the indentures governing the respective Exchangeable Notes. 
 On or after the respective exchangeable dates noted in the table above, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may exchange all or any portion of their Exchangeable Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon exchange, the issuer, in its sole discretion, has the option to settle the Exchangeable Notes with cash, shares of the Company s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock. Any shares issued in further settlement of the notes would be offset by shares received upon exercise of the Exchangeable Note Hedges (described below). 
 No 2026 or 2030 Exchangeable Notes were presented for exchange during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Neither of the 2026 and 2030 Exchangeable Notes were exchangeable as of September 30, 2024. 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no value in excess of the principal of each of the 2026 and 2030 Exchangeable Notes outstanding on an if-converted basis using the Company s stock price on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Additionally, all or any portion of the 2026 Exchangeable Notes may be redeemed for cash, at the issuer s option, at any time, and for the 2030 Exchangeable Notes on or after July 20, 2026, if the last reported sale price

 (a) The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating the dilutive impact of the outstanding Exchangeable Notes. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company adjusted net earnings attributable to Match Group, Inc. shareholders for the cash interest expense, net of income taxes, incurred on the 2026 and 2030 Exchangeable Notes. Dilutive shares were also included for the same series of Exchangeable Notes. 
 (b) If the effect is dilutive, weighted average common shares outstanding include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options, warrants, and subsidiary denominated equity and vesting of restricted stock units. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million potentially dilutive securities, respectively, and for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, million potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
 (c) Market-based awards and performance-based restricted stock units PSUs are considered contingently issuable shares. Shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of market-based awards and PSUs are included in the denominator for earnings per share if (i) the applicable market or performance condition(s) has been met and (ii) the inclusion of the market-based awards and PSUs is dilutive for the respective reporting periods. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and million shares, respectively, underlying market-based awards and PSUs, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the market or performance conditions had not been met.

The four operating and reportable segments consist of brands or group of brands within our portfolio: Tinder, Hinge, Match Group Asia MG Asia ), and Evergreen Emerging. We believe that providing additional information about these segments will provide investors more insight into how we manage our portfolio of brands to drive value at the Match Group level. 
 Corporate and unallocated costs includes 1) corporate expenses (such as executive management, investor relations, corporate development, and board of director and public company listing fees), 2) portions of corporate services (such as legal, human resources, accounting, and tax), and 3) certain centrally managed services and technology that have not been allocated to the individual business segments (such as central trust and safety operations and certain shared software).

 operating segments are also our reporting units for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment. The Company has re-allocated goodwill to each of the four reporting units based on their relative fair values as of September 30, 2024. This change in reporting units is considered a triggering event that requires a goodwill impairment assessment to be performed immediately before and after the change. These goodwill impairment tests were performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value and no impairments were identified. Goodwill was allocated to each of the reporting units as follows: Tinder billion; Hinge billion; MG Asia billion; and Evergreen Emerging billion.

reserve is established. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company. See Note 2 Income Taxes for additional information related to income tax contingencies. 
 FTC Lawsuit Against Match Group 
 On September 25, 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the FTC filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Texas against the company formerly known as Match Group, Inc. See FTC v. Match Group, Inc. , No. 3:19:cv-02281-K (Northern District of Texas). The complaint alleges that, prior to mid-2018, for marketing purposes Match.com notified non-paying users that other users were attempting to communicate with them, even though Match.com had identified those subscriber accounts as potentially fraudulent, thereby inducing non-paying users to subscribe and exposing them to the risk of fraud should they subscribe. The complaint also challenges the adequacy of Match.com s disclosure of the terms of its six-month guarantee, the efficacy of its cancellation process, and its handling of chargeback disputes. The complaint seeks among other things permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties, restitution, disgorgement, and costs of suit. On March 24, 2022, the

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Beginning with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, Match Group will present our business units as four operating segments consisting of Tinder, Hinge, Match Group Asia, and Evergreen Emerging. We believe providing additional information about these business units will provide investors more insight into how we manage our portfolio of brands to drive value at the Match Group level. Additionally, we will include a Corporate and unallocated costs category for expenses, the components of which are defined below. As a result of these changes, we will no longer report revenue by geography as we believe it is less insightful following the shift to multiple business units. 
 Key Terms: 
 Operating and financial metrics: 
 Tinder consists of the world-wide activity of the brand Tinder . 
 Hinge consists of the world-wide activity of the brand Hinge . 
 Match Group Asia MG Asia consists of the world-wide activity of the brands primarily focused on Asia and the Middle East, including Pairs and Azar . 
 Evergreen Emerging E E consists of the world-wide activity primarily of the brands Match , Meetic , OkCupid , Plenty Of Fish , and a number of demographically focused brands. 
 Corporate and unallocated costs includes 1) corporate expenses (such as executive management, investor relations, corporate development, and board of directors and public company listing fees), 2) portions of corporate services (such as legal, human resources, accounting, and tax), and 3) certain centrally managed services and technology that have not been allocated to the individual business segments (such as central trust and safety operations and certain shared software). 
 Direct Revenue is revenue that is received directly from end users of our services and includes both subscription and la carte revenue. 
 Indirect Revenue is revenue that is not received directly from an end user of our services, substantially all of which is advertising revenue. 
 Payers are unique users at a brand level in a given month from whom we earned Direct Revenue. When presented as a quarter-to-date or year-to-date value, Payers represents the average of the monthly values for the respective period presented. At a consolidated level and a business unit level to the extent a business unit consists of multiple brands, duplicate Payers may exist when we earn revenue from the same individual at multiple brands in a given month, as we are unable to identify unique individuals across brands in the Match Group portfolio. 
 Revenue Per Payer RPP is the average monthly revenue earned from a Payer and is Direct Revenue for a period divided by the Payers in the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. 
 Operating costs and expenses:

 MG Asia Direct Revenue declined 6 over the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Turkish Lira and Japanese Yen. Excluding these foreign exchange impacts, MG Asia Direct Revenue decreased 1 over the prior year quarter primarily related to Payer declines at the Pairs brand, partially offset by Payer growth at Azar. 
 E E Direct Revenue declined 9 over the prior year quarter, as our Evergreen brands collectively declined 14 , which was partially offset by a collective increase at our Emerging brands of 14 .

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating income decreased 14 and Adjusted Operating Income increased 3 . Operating income and Adjusted Operating Income each benefited from the increase in revenue of 13.9 million which was driven by growth at Hinge, and a decrease in cost of revenue due to lower live streaming costs related to the termination of live streaming services in 2024. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in product development expenses related to employee compensation due to increases in headcount at Tinder and an increase in selling and marketing expense, primarily at Tinder and Hinge. Operating income was further impacted by (i) impairments of intangible assets at E E and MG Asia in 2024 as a result of the termination of our live streaming services and Hakuna brand, (ii) increased depreciation expense due to increases in internally developed software placed in service, and (iii) increases in stock-based compensation expense, primarily as result of new stock-based awards granted in the current year. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating income decreased 9 and Adjusted Operating Income increased 4 , primarily due to the factors described above in the three-month discussion. Operating income and Adjusted Operating Income were further impacted by increases in cost of revenue related to increases in web hosting fees and in-app purchase fees, and increases in general and administrative expense mainly due to increases in employee compensation and increases in digital sales taxes. 
 At September 30, 2024, there was 400.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Match Group reports Adjusted Operating Income and Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects, both of which are supplemental measures to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Adjusted Operating Income is among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our business, on which our internal budget is based, and by which management is compensated. Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects provides a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed without the effect of exchange rate differences when compared to prior periods. We believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Match Group endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measures presented by providing the comparable GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measures. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures, which we discuss below. 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements, as applicable. We believe this measure is useful to analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted Operating Income measure because they are non-cash in nature. Adjusted Operating Income has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of certain expenses. 
 Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Adjusted Operating Income 
 Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options, restricted stock units RSUs ), performance-based RSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). To the extent stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, we remit the required tax-withholding amounts from current funds. 
 Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter. 
 Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer lists, trade names, and technology, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to (i) acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of trade names and trademarks, and (ii) goodwill, which are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.

 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates on Revenue 
 The impact of foreign exchange rates on the Company, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in exchange rates is significant. Since our results are reported in U.S. dollars, international revenue is favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies. We believe the presentation of revenue excluding the effects from foreign exchange, in addition to reported revenue, helps improve investors ability to understand the Company s performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of Match Group s core operating results. 
 Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by determining the change in current period revenue over prior period revenue where current period revenue is translated using prior period exchange rates.

 Our indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service, or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to pursue acquisitions or invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities. The Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make additional acquisitions and investments or to provide for greater financial flexibility. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Actual results could differ from these estimates.

In the course of these evaluations, the Company modifies and refines its internal processes as conditions warrant. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Match Group management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in providing reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and includes controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Overview 
 We are, and from time to time may become, involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business activities, such as trademark and patent infringement claims, trademark oppositions, and consumer or advertising complaints, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits, mass arbitrations, and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the SEC s rules. 
 Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, entered into in connection with our separation from IAC/InterActiveCorp, now known as IAC Inc. IAC ), we have agreed to indemnify IAC for matters relating to any business of Former Match Group, including indemnifying IAC for costs related to the matters described below other than the matter described under the heading Newman Derivative and Stockholder Class Action Regarding Separation Transaction . 
 The official names of legal proceedings in the descriptions below (shown in italics) reflect the original names of the parties when the proceedings were filed as opposed to the current names of the parties following the separation of Match Group and IAC. 
 Consumer Class Action Litigation Challenging Tinder s Age-Tiered Pricing 
 On May 28, 2015, a putative state-wide class action was filed against Tinder in state court in California. See Allan Candelore v. Tinder, Inc. , No. BC583162 (Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles). The complaint principally alleges that Tinder violated California s Unruh Civil Rights Act by offering and charging users over a certain age a higher price than younger users for subscriptions to its premium Tinder Plus service. On July 15, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff s motion to certify a class based upon California Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold subscribers age 29 and over. We believe that we have strong defenses to the allegations in the Candelore lawsuit and will continue to defend vigorously against it. 
 FTC Lawsuit Against Former Match Group 
 On September 25, 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the FTC filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Texas against the company formerly known as Match Group Former Match Group ). See FTC v. Match Group, Inc. , No. 3:19:cv-02281-K (Northern District of Texas). The complaint alleges that, prior to mid-2018, for marketing purposes Match.com notified non-paying users that other users were attempting to communicate with them, even though Match.com had identified those subscriber accounts as potentially fraudulent, thereby inducing non-paying users to subscribe and exposing them to the risk of fraud should they subscribe. The complaint also challenges the adequacy of Match.com s disclosure of the terms of its six-month guarantee, the efficacy of its cancellation process, and its handling of chargeback disputes. The complaint seeks among other things permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties, restitution, disgorgement, and costs of suit. On March 24, 2022, the court granted our motion to dismiss with prejudice on Claims I and II of the complaint relating to communication notifications and granted our motion to dismiss with respect to all requests for monetary damages on Claims III and IV relating to the guarantee offer and chargeback policy. On July 19, 2022, the FTC filed an amended complaint adding Match Group, LLC as a defendant. On September 11, 2023, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The case is set for trial in June 2025. We believe we have strong defenses to the FTC s claims regarding Match.com s practices, policies, and procedures and will continue to defend vigorously against them. 
 Irish Data Protection Commission Inquiry Regarding Tinder s Practices 
 On February 3, 2020, we received a letter from the Irish Data Protection Commission (the DPC notifying us that the DPC had commenced an inquiry examining Tinder s compliance with the EU s General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), focusing on Tinder s processes for handling access and deletion requests and Tinder s user data retention policies. On January 8, 2024, the DPC provided us with a preliminary draft decision 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 alleging that certain of Tinder s access and retention policies, largely relating to protecting the safety and privacy of Tinder s users, violate GDPR requirements. We filed our response to the preliminary draft decision on March 15, 2024. We believe we have strong defenses to these claims and will defend vigorously against them. 
 Newman Derivative and Stockholder Class Action Regarding Separation Transaction 
 On June 24, 2020, a Former Match Group shareholder filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Former Match Group and its board of directors, as well as Match Group, IAC Holdings, Inc., and Barry Diller seeking to recover unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the Company and directly as a result of his ownership of Former Match Group stock in relation to the separation of Former Match Group from its former majority shareholder, Match Group. See David Newman et al. v. IAC/Interactive Corp. et al. , C.A. No. 2020-0505-MTZ (Delaware Court of Chancery). The complaint alleges that that the special committee established by Former Match Group s board of directors to negotiate with Match Group regarding the separation transaction was not sufficiently independent of control from Match Group and Mr. Diller and that Former Match Group board members failed to adequately protect Former Match Group s interest in negotiating the separation transaction, which resulted in a transaction that was unfair to Former Match Group and its shareholders. On January 21, 2021, the case was consolidated with other shareholder actions, and an amended complaint was filed on April 14, 2021. See In Re Match Group, Inc. Derivative Litigation , Consolidated C.A. No. 2020-0505-MTZ (Delaware Court of Chancery). On September 1, 2022, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss with prejudice. On October 3, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court, and on April 4, 2024, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed and remanded the Chancery Court s dismissal, except for the Chancery Court s dismissal of derivative claims, which the Supreme Court affirmed. We believe we have strong defenses to the allegations in this lawsuit and the appeal and will defend vigorously against them. 
 FTC Investigation of Certain Subsidiary Data Privacy Representations 
 On March 19, 2020, the FTC issued an initial Civil Investigative Demand CID to the Company requiring us to produce certain documents and information regarding the allegedly wrongful conduct of OkCupid in 2014 and our public statements in 2019 regarding such conduct and whether such conduct and statements were unfair or deceptive under the FTC Act. On May 26, 2022, the FTC filed a Petition to Enforce Match Civil Investigative Demand. See FTC v. Match Group, Inc. , No. 1:22-mc-00054 (District of Columbia). We believe we have strong defenses to the FTC's investigation and petition to enforce and will defend vigorously against them. 
 Bardaji Securities Class Action 
 On March 6, 2023, a Match Group shareholder filed a complaint in federal district court in Delaware against Match Group, Inc., its Chief Executive Officer, its former Chief Executive Officer, and its President and Chief Financial Officer seeking to recover unspecified monetary damages on behalf of a class of acquirers of Match Group securities between November 3, 2021 and January 31, 2023. See Leopold Riola Bardaji v. Match Group, Inc. et al , No. 1:23-cv-00245-UNA (District of Delaware). The complaint alleges that Match Group, Inc. misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that its Tinder business was not effectively executing on its new product initiatives; as a result, Tinder was not on track to deliver its planned product initiatives in 2022; and therefore, Match Group, Inc. s statements about its Tinder s business, product initiatives, operations, and prospects lacked a reasonable basis. On July 24, 2023, lead plaintiff Northern California Pipe Trades Trust Funds filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint added allegations regarding misrepresentations relating to Match Group's acquisition of Hyperconnect and the business' subsequent integration and performance. On September 20, 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On July 12, 2024, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss without prejudice. We believe that we have strong defenses to the allegations in this lawsuit and will defend vigorously against them. 
 Oksayan Class Action 
 On February 14, 2024, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against Match Group, Inc. in the Northern District of California by six plaintiffs from California, New York, Georgia, and Florida. Among other things, Plaintiffs allege that the Tinder, Hinge, and The League apps are designed to be "addictive" in violation of various consumer protection, product liability, negligence, and other laws. Plaintiffs claim that these services business models and features addict unsuspecting users, leading to increased depression, loneliness, among other things. Plaintiffs further allege that Tinder, Hinge, and The League failed to warn them of the risks of addiction and that the apps are engaging in fraudulent business practices by marketing their apps in a misleading way. Plaintiffs

 seek monetary damages, as well as injunctive relief (implementing warnings, discontinuing certain marketing campaigns, providing resources). On June 10, 2024, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and on July 22, 2024, we filed a motion to compel plaintiffs claims to arbitration. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 12, 2024, and we filed a motion to dismiss on September 18, 2024. We believe that we have strong defenses to the allegations in this lawsuit and will defend vigorously against them.

All statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

 Certain of these and other risks and uncertainties are discussed in Match Group s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
