million and million , and million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Subscription, maintenance, and substantially all professional services revenue recognized over time totaled million and million , and million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to products and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the year was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Substantially all of our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term,

million and million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we expensed million and million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of million and million , respectively. During the comparable periods ending September 30, 2023, we expensed million and million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of million and million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred.

of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. We have recorded and maintain valuation allowances offsetting the Company s deferred tax assets in certain U.S. States and foreign jurisdictions. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances.

Diluted income per share includes the impact of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs), restricted shares, restricted stock units, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. 

 million common shares, plus common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (the 2020 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2024 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2020 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of common shares available for issuance under the 2024 Plan is million. We may also grant shares under our shareholder-approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) for up to million common shares. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or grants of restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, or ESPP shares. For SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition. Restricted shares and restricted stock units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, and ESPP shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock unit and restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. We use the simplified method for SSAR grants because we believe historical exercise data does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For restricted stock unit, restricted share, and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted shares, and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. We record compensation expense for ESPP shares on a straight-line basis over the applicable offering period. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

Total share-based compensation expense 

Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. We use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of service condition SSARs and a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of market condition SSARs. There were no SSARs granted during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Outstanding at September 30, 2024 

As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units was million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of years. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2024 that vested immediately for a total value of million. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares The ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through regular payroll deductions, up to a specified percentage of their eligible compensation. The ESPP is compensatory because, among other provisions, it currently allows participants to purchase stock at up to a discount from the lower of the closing price of a share of our common stock on the first or last trading day of the ESPP offering period. We measure share-based compensation expense for the ESPP based on the fair value of the ESPP grant at the beginning of the offering period. The fair value includes the value of the discount and the value associated with the call and put options that take advantage of the variability in the common stock price during the offering period. 

Risk-free interest rate over contractual term 

Expected term (in years) 

Expected volatility 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected term of the ESPP shares. The expected term is the offering period, which is typically six months. We record amounts withheld from participants during each offering period in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits in the consolidated balance sheets until such shares are purchased. Amounts withheld from participants for the offering period ending December 31, 2024 totaled million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was million in unrecognized share-based compensation expense related of the offering period ending December 31, 2024.

million (the Revolving Facility ). The Revolving Facility includes the ability for the Company to request an increase to the commitments under the Revolving Facility by an additional aggregate principal amount of up to million. On the Credit Agreement Closing Date, the Company drew million on the Revolving Facility (the Initial Revolving Loan ), the proceeds of which we used to fund the Business Combination as described in Note 11 below. We repaid million of the principal balance in October 2024. The Revolving Facility matures on August 16, 2027, the three-year anniversary of the Credit Agreement Closing Date, at which time any and all outstanding principal balance will be due and payable. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans and terminate commitments under the Revolving Facility at any time without premium or penalty. There are no repayments required before August 16, 2027. Debt issuance costs relating to the Revolving Facility of million, included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, amortize into interest expense over the three-year life of the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Revolving Facility are guaranteed by certain of the Company s subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors ), subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations. Pursuant to a security and pledge agreement, dated as of the Credit Agreement Closing Date, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent, the Revolving Facility is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company s and the Subsidiary Guarantors present and future personal assets and intangible assets and the outstanding capital stock of the Company s subsidiaries owned by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations. The Initial Revolving Loan bears interest at the SOFR Daily Floating Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an initial margin of , which is subject to adjustment as of each fiscal quarter end within the ranges set forth in the Credit Agreement. We are to pay a commitment fee under the Revolving Facility in respect of any unutilized commitments thereunder, which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from to per annum. The initial commitment fee is subject to quarterly adjustment beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2024. We record the commitment fee as a component of interest expense. Interest and commitment fees are payable quarterly. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio determined at the end of each fiscal quarter as defined in the Credit Agreement.

(the "Acquisition Date"), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Book4Time Parent, Inc. Book4Time ), a hospitality software company based in Canada. Book4Time is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc. The consolidated financial statements include the results of Book4Time s operations since the Acquisition Date. The acquisition expands the opportunity to increase our solutions-per-customer globally. The purchase price consisted of million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand and the proceeds of the Initial Revolving Loan, partially offset by million of Book4Time s cash received in the acquisition resulting in net cash consideration of million. We allocated the purchase price for Book4Time to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the Acquisition Date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We determined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts the expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management.

Total purchase price allocation 

We assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade name estimated useful lives of years, s, s, and years, respectively, with a weighted average useful life of approximately years. The identifiable intangible assets acquired amortize on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives. The goodwill recognized in the Book4Time purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve a broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce, which is not separable from goodwill under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805. As part of the acquisition, the Company acquired fully trained personnel thereby avoiding the expenditure that would have been required to hire and train equivalent personnel. We considered the replacement cost method as most appropriate for the assembled workforce valuation. We valued the assembled workforce included in goodwill at million. The total goodwill recognized in the acquisition amounted to million, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. As of the Acquisition Date, we recorded current liabilities of million for uncertain tax positions, including estimated penalties and interest, we identified during the acquisition. We recorded a related indemnification asset of million in current assets covered by funds held in escrow under the terms of the share purchase agreement and escrow agreement we entered into with the sellers of Book4Time. We have prepared the Book4Time purchase price allocation on a preliminary basis. Changes to the allocation may occur as additional information becomes available during the measurement period (up to one year from the Acquisition Date). The

million related to the acquisition of Book4Time, consisting primarily of professional fees, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The consolidated statement of operations includes these costs in other charges. Revenue attributable to Book4Time included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was million. Net income (loss) was not material. Unaudited Pro-Forma Information The financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of Agilysys and Book4Time, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place on April 1, 2023 or of results that may occur in the future.

We based the foregoing pro forma results on estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting. We included acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges incurred in the earliest period presented. 

 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Convertible Preferred Stock to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the Holders each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the Purchaser ), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of million. We incurred issuance costs of million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Conversion On November 24, 2023, at our option, we required conversion of all the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock. On November 27, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Elimination with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to which the Convertible Preferred Stock was eliminated and returned to the status of authorized and unissued preferred shares of the Company. Following the mandatory conversion of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock on November 24, 2023, there were no outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock. Accordingly, we removed the Series A convertible preferred stock, par value from temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet and recorded the associated increase of common shares at stated value and capital in excess of stated value further reflected in our consolidated statement of shareholders' equity. Dividends

per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50 in cash and 50 in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100 in cash, at the option of the Company. We paid dividends in the same period as declared by the Company s Board of Directors. Accounting Policy Prior to the conversion on November 24, 2023, we classified convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that were at the election of the Holders. We increased the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value for all undeclared dividends using the interest method.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 In Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A ), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: 
 what factors affect our business; 
 what our earnings and costs were; 
 why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; 
 where the earnings came from; 
 how our financial condition was affected; and 
 where the cash will come from to fund future operations. 
 The MD A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2024. Information provided in the MD A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Information on page 29 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A Risk Factors in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. 
 Overview 
 Recent Developments 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, global macroeconomic conditions were, and continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, political unrest, armed conflicts, labor shortages and natural disasters. We believe such conditions are impacting customer spending and provider pricing decisions resulting in decreased demand, increased costs, and reduced margins particularly in areas outside of the United States.

Net revenue. Total net revenue increased 9.7 million, or 16.5 , during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Products revenue decreased 2.1 million, or 16.7 , due to increasing customer preference for subscription-based software licenses instead of perpetual software licenses and to their decreasing need for hardware due to improvements we have made to our technology enabling more support for consumer grade devices our customers can source elsewhere. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased 7.2 million, or 21.0 , compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue including 2.1 million in Book4Time subscription-based revenue. Total subscription revenue, including Book4Time subscription revenue, increased 36.6 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Professional services revenue increased 4.6 million, or 39.2 , due to higher sales and service activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations.

Our total gross profit increased 8.1 million, or 23.1 , during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and total gross profit margin increased from 59.9 to 63.3 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit decreased 0.6 million, or 9.7 , and products gross profit margin increased from 46.6 to 50.5 due to the composition of hardware and proprietary software products delivered. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased 6.2 million, or 23.3 , and gross profit margin increased from 77.2 to 78.7 as revenue increases outpaced variable costs as a result of certain cost control measures. Professional services gross profit increased 2.5 million, or 91.5 , and gross profit margin increased from 23.6 to 32.4 reflecting improved utilization rates from efficiency gains on multi-solution implementations and revenue associated with a large development service contract.

Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles increased 0.6 million, or 160.5 , in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024 due to the addition of certain intangible assets resulting from the Book4Time acquisition.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, income tax provision and the effective tax rate were primarily driven by activity within the foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates as valuation allowances were recorded against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Canada. We released valuation allowances recorded against Canadian, U.S. Federal and certain state deferred tax assets in the period ending December 31, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax provision and the effective tax rate were primarily driven by activity in the U.S. and India. 
 24 

We are consistently subject to tax audits. Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. 
 We have recorded and maintain valuation allowances offsetting the Company s deferred tax assets in certain U.S. States and foreign jurisdictions. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances.

 For the six months ended September 30, 2023, income tax provision and the effective tax rate were primarily driven by activity within the foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates as valuation allowances were recorded against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Canada. We released valuation allowances recorded against Canadian, U.S. Federal and certain state deferred tax assets in the period ending December 31, 2023. 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, income tax (benefit) and the effective tax rate were primarily driven by the impact of discrete excess tax benefits associated with Share-Based Compensation. 
 27 

We are consistently subject to tax audits. Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. 
 We have recorded and maintain valuation allowances offsetting the Company s deferred tax assets in certain U.S. States and foreign jurisdictions. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary recurring source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of products and services to our customers, including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance. 
 Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, and payments of contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and our Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial maximum aggregate principal amount of 75 million (the Revolving Facility ). The Revolving Facility includes the ability for the Company to request an increase to the commitments under the Revolving Facility by an additional aggregate principal amount of up to 25 million. On the Credit Agreement Closing Date, we drew 50 million on the Revolving Facility, the proceeds of which we used to fund the Business Combination described below. 
 We have expanded our business in part by investing in strategic growth through business acquisitions. We have used cash as consideration in our business acquisitions, including 144.9 million of net cash, partially funded by our Revolving Facility, during the six months ended September 30, 2024, to complete the acquisition of Book4Time. We completed no business combinations during the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, 100 of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 89 were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. 
 We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of 54.9 million as of September 30, 2024, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements.

 Forward-Looking Information 
 This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "goal," "seek," "believe," "project," "estimate," "expect," "strategy," "future," "likely," "may," "should," "will" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Chief Financial Officer CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, as Principal Accounting Officer PAO ), management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and PAO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 29 

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the six months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our CEO, CFO and PAO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

For purposes of determining the Total Revolving Outstandings at any time during which an Autoborrow Agreement is in effect (other than for purposes of calculating Commitment Fees), the Outstanding Amount of all Swingline Loans shall be deemed to be the amount of the Swingline Sublimit. For purposes of any Swingline Borrowing pursuant to the Autoborrow Agreement, all references to Bank of America in the Autoborrow Agreement shall be deemed to be a reference to Bank of America, in its capacity as Swingline Lender hereunder. 
 (c)	 Refinancing of Swingline Loans .

Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02 , without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 .

The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender. 
 (ii)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i (including, without limitation, the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 ), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii)	 Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.

 (d)	 Obligations of Lenders Several .

 (g)	 Insufficient Funds.

 Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.

Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans and SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans and in the case of SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans and (B) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR.

 (a)	If in connection with any request for a SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan or a conversion of Base Rate Loans to SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans or a continuation of any of such Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b), and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans or SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base

 (b)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, but without limiting Sections 3.03(a above, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent demonstrable error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined (which determination likewise shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent demonstrable error), that: 
 (i)	adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR including, without limitation, because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 
 (ii)	CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide such representative interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date ); 
 then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate) . 
 If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis. 
 67 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than 0.0 , the Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0.0 for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 (c)	For purposes of this Section 3.03 , those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders.

 (d)	 Delay in Requests .

 (ii)	Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant.

Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant.
