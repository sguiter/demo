 billion under the Revolving Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Loan Facility had million reserved for the floorplan sub-facility. 
 Term Loan 
 The senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility has a variable interest rate. The interest rate is based on SOFR plus a spread adjustment and a margin based on the Company s senior unsecured rating. No mandatory payments are required on the remaining principal amount until its maturity date on December 1, 2026. 
 Unsecured Senior Notes 
 The unsecured senior notes have a fixed interest rate, which is paid semi-annually. 
 Receivable Financing 
 The receivable financing liability relates to certain accounts receivable transferred to third-party financial institutions that did not qualify as a sale under the terms of the agreements. While the terms of such agreements are on a nonrecourse basis, the transfers of accounts receivable could not achieve certain criteria that would allow derecognition of the accounts receivable. The proceeds from these arrangements are recognized as a liability and the associated accounts receivable remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the liability is settled. The Company did not execute any transfers under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Debt Issuances and Extinguishments 
 On August 22, 2024, the Company completed the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes at of par and million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2034 (the 2034 Notes at of par (collectively, the Notes ). Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest on the 2034 Notes is payable semi-annually on February 22 and August 22 of each year. The net proceeds from the Notes issuance were used to fund the settlement of the concurrent cash tender offer and the payment of related accrued and unpaid interest, fees and expenses and general corporate purposes, including the redemption of the remaining Senior Notes due 2024 and the repayment at maturity of the remaining Senior Notes due 2025. 
 On August 22, 2024, concurrent with the Notes issuance, the Company completed a cash tender offer for million and million of the outstanding aggregate principal amounts under its Senior Notes due 2024 and the Senior Notes due 2025, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest, fees and expenses. In connection with the cash tender offer, the Company recognized an immaterial net gain on extinguishment of debt, which is presented within Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Fair Value 
 The fair values of the unsecured senior notes were estimated using quoted market prices for identical liabilities that are traded in over-the-counter secondary markets. The fair value of the Term Loan Facility was estimated using dealer quotes and other market observable inputs for comparable liabilities. The unsecured senior notes and Term Loan Facility were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the Revolving Loan Facility approximates fair value.

 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and these agreements mature on September 30, 2026. 
 The fair values of the Company s interest rate collar agreements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of the interest rate collar agreements is derived using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash receipts or cash disbursements that would occur if variable interest rates rise above or fall below the strike rates of the interest rate cap and interest rate floor, respectively. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate collar agreements, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including SOFR curves and implied volatilities. The Company also incorporates insignificant credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. The counterparty credit spreads are based on publicly available credit information obtained from a third-party credit data provider. 
 The interest rate collars are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL and are subsequently reclassified into Interest expense, net in the period when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the changes in fair value for the effective portion of the derivative financial instruments and the reclassification from AOCL to Interest expense, net were not material. 
 Treasury Locks 
 The Company used treasury lock agreements to manage interest rate risk in advance of the issuance of fixed rate debt. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed and settled treasury lock agreements for a total notional value of million, concurrent with the issuance of unsecured senior notes. The treasury lock agreements were settled at an immaterial loss. For additional information regarding the issuance of the unsecured senior notes, see Note 5 (Debt). 
 The treasury lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges. The loss on the settlement was recorded to AOCL and is subsequently reclassified into Interest expense, net over the term of the debt in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the reclassification from AOCL to Interest expense, net was not material.

 (2) There were fewer than million potential common shares excluded from diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Inclusion of these common shares in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

Our Small Business segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with up to 250 employees. Our Public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US. We also have two other operating segments: CDW UK and CDW Canada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category Other ). 
 We are vendor, technology and consumption model unbiased, with a solutions portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands. Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through approximately 11,200 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers, software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our vendor partners ), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access. 
 We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time. 
 
 Trends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance 
 We believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance, influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted financial and operating results: 
 General economic conditions are a key factor affecting our results as they can impact our customers willingness and ability to spend on information technology. Macroeconomic uncertainty persists as a result of the inflationary environment and corresponding level of interest rates driven by monetary policy. The uncertainty in the current economic environment resulted in, and may continue to result in, a delay, pause or reduction of investments in technology by our customers. 
 Customers are evaluating the complex technology landscape in order to balance priorities and focus on solutions that lead to business optimization, cost management and security risk management, resulting in a more measured approach to their IT spending. We have orchestrated solutions by leveraging security, software and hybrid and cloud offerings to help customers achieve their objectives. 
 Changes and uncertainty related to spending policies, budget priorities, timing and funding levels, including current and future stimulus packages, are key factors influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers. As the duration and ongoing impact of current economic conditions remain uncertain, current

 and future budget priorities and funding levels for government, healthcare and education customers may be adversely affected, leading to lower IT spend. 
 Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market. Current technology trends are focused on delivering greater flexibility and efficiency, as well as designing and managing IT securely. These trends are driving customer adoption of cloud, generative artificial intelligence, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations. The trends are further driven by the evolution of the IT consumption model to more as a service offerings, including software as a service and infrastructure as a service, in addition to ongoing managed and professional service arrangements. Technology trends are likely to evolve as customers prioritize spend that will produce the most important outcomes for their business. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. Financial measures include both US GAAP, the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and Non-GAAP, which excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Operating income, Operating income margin, Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Net income, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per diluted share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Average daily sales, Net cash provided by operating activities, Adjusted free cash flow, Cash conversion cycle, and Net debt. These measures and ratios are closely monitored by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve financial objectives. 
 For the definitions, discussion of management s use of Non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measure, see Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations. 
 
 The results of certain key business metrics for the comparative periods are as follows:

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales decreased 112 million, or 2.0 , with lower Net sales in the Public and Corporate segments, partially offset by UK and Canadian operations. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in netcomm products, partially offset by an increase in notebooks/mobile devices. Continued economic uncertainty and the complex technology landscape has led customers to be cautious and measured in their approach to technology spending, leading to a decline in Net sales. 
 
 Gross profit decreased 27 million, or 2.2 , primarily due to lower Net sales across various hardware categories, partially offset by increased netted down revenue. Gross profit margin, expressed as Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales, remained consistent at 21.8 . 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses decreased 30 million, or 4.0 , primarily due to lower performance-based compensation, including equity-based compensation, consistent with lower attainment against certain financial measures. 
 
 Operating income increased 3 million, or 0.7 , to 482 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 478 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. Interest expense, net decreased 3 million, or 5.2 , primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances, partially offset by increased interest expense on higher debt levels. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 7 million, or 6.6 . The effective tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of Income before income taxes, was 26.0 and 24.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales decreased 545 million, or 3.3 , with lower Net sales across all operating segments. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in netcomm and collaboration products, partially offset by an increase in notebooks/mobile devices. Continued economic uncertainty and the complex technology landscape has led customers to be cautious and measured in their approach to technology spending, leading to a decline in Net sales. 
 
 Gross profit decreased 52 million, or 1.5 . Gross profit margin, expressed as Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales, increased 40 basis points primarily driven by a higher contribution of netted down revenue, primarily software as a service, partially offset by an increased mix into notebooks/mobile devices.

Selling and administrative expenses decreased 48 million, or 2.1 , primarily due to lower performance-based compensation, including equity-based compensation, consistent with lower attainment against certain financial measures, and lower workplace optimization costs, partially offset by increased transformation and other related costs. 
 
 Operating income decreased 3 million, or 0.3 , to 1,243 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,246 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense, net decreased 15 million, or 8.8 , primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances and decreased interest expense on lower average debt levels during 2024, partially offset by higher variable interest rate on the senior unsecured term loan. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 9 million, or 3.4 . The effective tax rate was 24.9 and 24.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations 
 Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance or financial condition that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. 
 Our non-GAAP performance measures include Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share and Net sales on a constant currency basis, and our non-GAAP financial condition measures include Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow. These non-GAAP performance measures and non-GAAP financial condition measures are collectively referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization. Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration 
 27 

Table of Contents 

expenses, transformation initiatives, workplace optimization and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on Net sales. Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash flow adjusted to include certain cash flows from financing activities incurred in the normal course of operations or as capital expenditures. 
 We believe our non-GAAP performance measures provide analysts, investors and management with useful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. We also present non-GAAP financial condition measures as we believe they provide analysts, investors and management with more information regarding our liquidity and capital resources. Certain non-GAAP financial measures are also used to determine certain components of performance-based compensation. 
 We have included reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable US GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 below.

 Seasonality 
 While we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, sales in our Public segment have historically been higher in the second and third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of education and government customers. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 We finance our operations and capital expenditures with cash from operations and borrowings under our variable rate senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the Revolving Loan Facility ). As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.3 billion of availability for borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility. Our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. We also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy, which includes dividend payments, assessment of debt levels, acquisitions and share repurchases. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year; however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. The amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan, general economic conditions and working capital management. 
 Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total unsecured indebtedness of 6.0 billion, and we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreements and indentures. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.100 Senior Notes due 2030 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.550 Senior Notes due 2034 (collectively, the Notes ). Concurrent with the Notes issuance, we settled a cash tender offer for 391 million and 389 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amounts under the 5.500 Senior Notes due 2024 and the 4.125 Senior Notes due 2025, respectively. 
 We may from time to time repurchase one or more series of our outstanding unsecured senior notes, depending on market conditions, contractual commitments, our capital needs and other factors. Repurchases of our senior notes may be made by

open market or privately negotiated transactions and may be pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or otherwise. On October 7, 2024, we redeemed the remaining outstanding 5.500 Senior Notes due 2024, which were scheduled to mature on December 1, 2024, at par for 184 million. 
 For additional information regarding our debt and refinancing activities, see Note 5 (Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Inventory Financing Agreements 
 We have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions to enhance liquidity. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense or other incremental expenses associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For additional information, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for 354 million under the previously announced share repurchase program. For additional information on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Dividends 
 A summary of 2024 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows: 
 Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date 0.620 February 6, 2024 February 26, 2024 March 12, 2024 0.620 April 30, 2024 May 24, 2024 June 11, 2024 0.620 July 30, 2024 August 26, 2024 September 10, 2024 
 On October 30, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of 0.625 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 10, 2024 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 25, 2024. 
 The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions (including in current or future agreements governing our indebtedness), restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.

In order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows: 
 September 30, (in days) 2024 2023 Days of sales outstanding (DSO) (1) 
 79 73 Days of supply in inventory (DIO) (2) 
 14 14 Days of purchases outstanding (DPO) (3) 
 (76) (72) Cash conversion cycle 17 15 
 (1) Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily Net sales for the same three-month period. Also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables. 
 (2) Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period. 
 (3) Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of Accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and Accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period. 
 The cash conversion cycle increased to 17 days at September 30, 2024, compared to 15 days at September 30, 2023. The overall increase was primarily driven by an increase in DSO due to multi-year transactions and timing of collections. This was partially offset by an increase in DPO due to multi-year transactions and timing of payments. Netted down revenue results in an increase to both DSO and DPO as the corresponding receivables and payables reflect the gross amounts due from customers and due to vendors while the corresponding sales and cost of sales are reflected on a net basis within Net sales. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 110 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments with no similar activity in the prior year, partially offset by cash flows for acquisitions in 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased 469 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by the Notes issuance and lower share repurchases, partially offset by the payments related to the settlement on the cash tender offer and decreased activity associated with inventory financing arrangements. For additional information regarding the inventory financing agreements, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) and for debt activities, see Note 5 (Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Issuers and Guarantors of Debt Securities
