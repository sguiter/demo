Significant renewals and betterments will be capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation will be removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, will be reflected in operations. The Company will assess the recoverability of property and equipment by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of these assets over their remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of equipment impairment, if any, will be measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management. Intangible Assets years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. The testing of these intangibles under established guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions. Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations.

Freeze Tag or the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 contains forward-looking statements, principally in this Section and Business. Generally, you can identify these statements because they use words like anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, plans, and similar terms. These statements reflect only our current expectations. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties, many of which are unforeseen, including, among others, the risks we face as described in this filing. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements that, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In any forward-looking statement where we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation of belief will be accomplished. We believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors. There may be events in the future; however, that we are unable to predict accurately or over which we have no control. The risk factors listed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as any cautionary language in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our last Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include but are not limited to: distributors not accepting our games; price reductions; unforeseen delays in game production; changes in product strategies; general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in various tax laws; and the availability of key management and other personnel. Summary Overview Freeze Tag, Inc. is a creator of location-based, mobile social games that are fun and engaging for consumers and businesses. Based on a free-to-play business model that has propelled games built and marketed by some of our competitors to worldwide success, we employ state-of-the-art data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. Players can download and enjoy our games for free, and, if they so choose, they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor. In October 2017, Rob Vardeman, former President of Munzee Inc. joined gaming industry veterans, Craig Holland and Mick Donahoo, to form a stronger and well-rounded Freeze Tag team through a merger. In addition to successful games Freeze Tag has launched previously, the current portfolio of games includes hits such as Munzee, a real-world gaming adventure and social platform with over 8 million locations worldwide and hundreds of thousands of players, WallaBee, an addictive collecting game with over 2,000 beautifully drawn digital cards. We also offer our technology and services to businesses that want to leverage our expertise in location-based mobile gaming in their marketing and branding programs. For example, our Eventzee solution allows businesses to create private scavenger hunts in physical places such as malls, tradeshows, company events or campuses to create immersive brand experiences. Central to Freeze Tag s core strategy is capitalizing on fast-growing trends in the mobile applications world, including geofencing and location-based advertising. We plan to leverage the combined company s proprietary technology and expertise to create more exciting location-based experiences in our games. Going Concern Uncertainty The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes continuity of operations and realization of assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business. As shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a net loss of 354,461 and used net cash of 235,893 in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 866,806 and a total stockholders deficit of 558,283. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that by continuing to implement cost reductions, and by increasing revenue from updated product lines, operating cash flows will be sufficient to support the Company s business plan. However, management is currently evaluating alternative financing sources to fund the Company s current business plan should cash provided by operations be insufficient. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon successfully executing its plans to attain a successful level of operations. The Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if it were unable to continue as a going concern. 16 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on historical experience and judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made. However, all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and actual results may differ. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our financial statements included in this filing. The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that involve estimates and management s judgment. Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are derived primarily by licensing software products in the form of mobile games for smartphone and tablet platforms. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; identification of the performance obligations in the contract; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist primarily of intellectual property, customer base and non-compete agreements acquired in 2017, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 5 years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation and ASC Subtopic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the requisite services period is based on the value of share-based payment awards after reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Software Development Costs Software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed products and payments made to independent software developers and/or contract engineers and artists. The Company accounts for software development costs in accordance with the FASB guidance for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as found in ASC Subtopic 985-20. On a case-by-case basis, certain software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and working model. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues. For products where proven game engine technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established. For most products, technological feasibility is established when a detailed game design document containing sufficient technical specifications written for a proven game engine or framework technology had been created and approved by management. However, technological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to the appropriate expense account. Amounts that were considered research and development that are not capitalized are immediately charged to general and administrative expense. 17 Table of Contents Prior to a product s release, the Company expenses, as part of Cost of Sales Product Development, capitalized costs when the Company believes such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation. Commencing upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to Cost of Sales Product Development based on the straight-line method. The Company evaluates the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on an annual basis. For products that have been released in prior years, the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance. For products that are scheduled to be released in future years, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel was based. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Although there were new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and through the date of filing of this report, we do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Results of Operations Revenues Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 532,637 were down 592 from revenues of 533,229 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1,514,159 were down 109,984 from revenues of 1,624,143 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues year over year was due to a reduction in demand for some product types. We are continuing to make improvements in our products and have expectations for continued growth in our Munzee and Eventzee apps, and we expect to see increased demand going forward. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 11,553 to 112,425 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 100,872 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 329,606 were up 35,373 from cost of sales of 294,233 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a mainly a result of increased server and supporting software product costs offset by a decrease in physical product costs (inventory of physical products). Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 22,642 to 447,175 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 469,817 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1,506,069 were up 139,259 from 1,366,810 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in accounting, salary, external software developers, insurance, and travel expenses, offset by a decrease in rent, and slight decrease in marketing, general office, and postage expenses. Other Expense Total other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 11,032 was 76 lower than other expense of 11,108 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 32,945 was down 1,362 from 34,307 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense remained relatively stable. Net Loss As a result of the above, we reported net loss of 37,995 and 354,461 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 48,568 and 71,207 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 18 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction As of September 30, 2024, we had current assets of 178,229, including cash of 139,570, and current liabilities of 1,045,035, resulting in a working capital deficit of 866,806. In addition, we had a total stockholders deficit of 558,283 at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used net cash of 243,792. Management believes that by continuing to implement cost reductions, and by increasing revenue from updated product lines, operating cash flows will be sufficient to support our business plan. However, management is currently evaluating alternative financing sources to fund our current business plan should cash provided by operations be insufficient. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. Sources and Uses of Cash We used net cash of 235,893 from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Conversion Rights . The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the Conversion Rights ): 4.1 Right to Convert . 4.1.1 Conversion Ratio and Stock Certificate . Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, beginning on the date the Holder acquired the shares of Preferred Stock, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into fifty (50) shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (the Conversion Ratio ). Unless specifically requested by the Holder to be issued physical certificates for the Preferred Stock, the Corporation, itself or through its transfer agent, shall issue the Preferred Stock in book-entry form, or in other electronic format. The Corporation or its transfer agent shall issue to Holder a statement reflecting his holding of Preferred Stock, and shall deliver an updated statement to Holder upon request. 4.1.2 Conversion Limitation . In no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any Series B Preferred Stock, such that upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of this Series B Preferred Stock or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso, provided, further, however, that the limitations on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder, not less than 61 days prior written notice to the Corporation, and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice of waiver). 4.1.3 Termination of Conversion Rights . Subject to Section 4.3.1 in the case of a Contingency Event (as defined therein), in the event of a reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Corporation, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the first payment of any funds and assets distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock. 4 4.2 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall round up and issue one additional share of Common Stock to the holder, unless such rounding would cause the Holder to violate the conversion limitation outlined in Section 4.1.2, above, and in that case the fractional share shall be rounded down to the next whole share of Common Stock. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. 4.3 Mechanics of Conversion . 4.3.1 Notice of Conversion . The Holder has the right, at any time, at its election, to convert all or any number of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, at the Conversion Ratio defined in Section 4.1.1 above, except as limited by Section 4.1.2 , above. A conversion notice (the Conversion Notice ), describing conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, and if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent (a Contingency Event ), may be delivered to Corporation by method of Holder s choice (including but not limited to email, facsimile, mail, overnight courier, or personal delivery). All conversions shall be cashless and not require further payment from the Holder. The Corporation shall be responsible for all expenses associated with processing the conversion, such as transfer agent expenses and Corporation s legal expenses. If no objection is delivered from the Corporation to the Holder, with respect to any variable or calculation reflected in the Conversion Notice within 24 hours of delivery of the Conversion Notice, the Corporation shall have been thereafter deemed to have irrevocably confirmed and irrevocably ratified such notice of conversion and waived any objection thereto. The Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock from any conversion to the Holder (in any name directed by the Holder) within three (3) business days of Conversion Notice delivery. If the Corporation is participating in the Depository Trust Company DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer FAST program, then upon request of the Holder and provided that the shares to be issued are eligible for transfer under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or are effectively registered under the Securities Act, the Corporation shall cause its transfer agent to electronically issue the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder through the DTC Direct Registration System DRS ). If the Corporation is not participating in the DTC FAST program, then the Corporation agrees in good faith to apply and cause the approval for participation in the DTC FAST program. If Corporation fails to deliver shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in this Section 4.3.1 , then for each conversion, in the event that shares are not delivered by the fourth business day (inclusive of the day of conversion), a penalty of 1,500 per day shall be assessed for each day after the third business day (inclusive of the day of the conversion) until share delivery is made. 4.3.2 Reservation of Shares . The Corporation shall at all times while any share of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such corporate action to be taken as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing a series of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary so that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. 5 4.3.3 Effect of Conversion . All shares of Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued. 4.3.4 No Further Adjustment . Upon any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Ratio of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be made with respect to the converted shares for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion. 4.3.5 Transfer Agent Instructions . In the event that an opinion of counsel, such as but not limited to a Rule 144 opinion, is needed for any matter related to the Preferred Stock or the Common Stock the Holder has the right to have any such opinion provided by its counsel. If the Holder chooses to have its counsel provide such opinion, then the Holder shall provide the Corporation with written notice. Within three (3) business days of receiving written notice, the Corporation shall instruct its transfer agent to rely upon opinions from the Holder s counsel. A penalty of 1,500 per day shall be assessed for each day after the third business day (inclusive of the day of request) until the reliance instruction is delivered to the transfer agent. If the Holder requests that the Corporation s counsel issue an opinion, and such an opinion can be legally issued under federal and state securities laws, then the Corporation shall cause the issuance of the requested opinion within three (3) business days. A penalty of 1,500 per day shall be assessed for each day after the third business day (inclusive of the day of request) until the requested opinion is delivered. The Corporation warrants that it will not direct its transfer agent not to transfer or delay, impair, and/or hinder its transfer agent in transferring (or issuing)(electronically or in certificated form) any certificate for the Securities to be issued to the Holder and it will not fail to remove (or direct its transfer agent not to remove or impair, delay, and/or hinder its transfer agent from removing) any restrictive legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect thereof) on any certificate for the Securities when required by this Certificate of Designation. The Corporation acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Corporation acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Certificate of Designation may be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Corporation of these provisions, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate transfer, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required 4.3.6 The Holder and the Corporation agree that all penalty amounts described in this Section 4.3 may be payable in additional Preferred Stock or cash, at the election of the Holder, and shall tack back to the Original Issue Date, with respect to the holding period under Rule 144, so long as such treatment is not inconsistent with Rule 144 s applicable tacking provisions. 6 4.4 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations . If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the date on which the first share of a series of Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation (such date referred to herein as the Original Issue Date for such series of Preferred Stock) effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Ratio for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Ratio for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this Section 4.4 shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. 4.5 Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Ratio for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Ratio then in effect by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and (b) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Ratio shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter such Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.5 as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (ii) no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. 7 4.6 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then and in each such event the holders of such series of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. 4.7 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution . If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, or otherwise other than by a stock split or combination, dividend, distribution, merger or consolidation covered by Sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 or 4.8), then in any such event each holder of such series of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change. 4.8 Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation . If there shall occur any consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not a series of Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash, or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections 4.5, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such consolidation or merger, provision shall be made that each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible, in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event, into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of such series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 3 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Ratio of such series of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock. 4.9 Certificate as to Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Ratio of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of any series of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (a) the Conversion Ratio of such series of Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock. 8 5. No Impairment . The Corporation will not, through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, including amending this Certificate of Designation, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 5 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock against impairment. This provision shall not restrict the Corporation from amending its Articles of Incorporation in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware and the terms hereof. 6. Call Provisions . The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be callable by the Company. 7. Redemption . The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable by the Company. 8. Notices . Any notices required by the provisions of this Certificate of Designation to be given to the holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if sent by facsimile or overnight courier to the address appearing on the books of the Corporation, and shall be conclusively deemed given at the time of delivery if made during normal business hours, otherwise notice shall be deemed given on the next business day. 9. Voting Provisions . The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not have voting rights. 10. Protective Provisions . So long as any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative approval of the Holders of a majority of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a class), (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series B Preferred Stock or alter or amend this Certificate of Designations, (b) authorize or create any class of stock ranking as to distribution of assets upon a liquidation senior to the Series B Preferred Stock, (c) amend its certificate or articles of incorporation or other charter documents in breach of any of the provisions hereof, (d) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of the Corporation, or effect any liquidation event, or (e) enter into any agreement with respect to the foregoing. 9 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Certificate of Designation of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to be duly executed by its Chief Executive Officer and attested to by its Secretary this 5th day of October, 2017. /s/ Craig Holland /s/ Mick Donahoo By: Craig Holland By: Mick Donahoo Its: President Its: Secretary 10

(Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware) The undersigned, Craig Holland and Mick Donahoo, does hereby certify that: A. They are the duly elected and acting President and Secretary, respectively, of Freeze Tag, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Corporation ). B.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors does hereby fix and determine the rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions, and other matters relating to the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock as follows: 1 1. Definitions . For purposes of this Certificate of Designation, the following definitions shall apply: 1.1 Board shall mean the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 1.2 Corporation shall mean Freeze Tag, Inc., a Delaware Corporation. 1.3 Common Stock shall mean the common stock, 0.00001 par value per share, of the Corporation after giving effect to a 1-for-100 reverse stock split effective with the State of Delaware on September 28, 2017. 1.4 Common Stock Dividend shall mean a stock dividend declared and paid on the Common Stock that is payable in shares of Common Stock. 1.5 Distribution shall mean the transfer of cash or property by the Corporation to one or more of its stockholders without consideration, whether by dividend or otherwise (except a dividend in shares of Corporation's stock). 1.6 Holder shall mean a holder of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. 1.7 Original Issue Date shall mean the date on which the first share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation. 1.8 Original Issue Price shall mean 1.00 per share for the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. 1.9 Person shall mean an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a limited liability company, an unincorporated business organization, a trust or other entity or organization, and any government or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof. 1.10 Preferred Stock or Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall mean the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, 0.00001 par value per share, of the Corporation. 1.11 Subsidiary shall mean any corporation or limited liability company or corporation of which at least fifty percent (50 of the outstanding voting stock or membership interests, as the case may be, is at the time owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation or by one or more of such subsidiary corporations. 2 2. Dividend Rights . 2.1 In each calendar year, the holders of the then outstanding Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board, out of any funds and assets of the Corporation legally available therefore, noncumulative dividends in an amount equal to any dividends or other Distribution on the Common Stock in such calendar year (other than a Common Stock Dividend). No dividends (other than a Common Stock Dividend) shall be paid, and no Distribution shall be made, with respect to the Common Stock unless dividends in such amount shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock simultaneously. Dividends on the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be mandatory or cumulative, and no rights or interest shall accrue to the holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that the Corporation shall fail to declare or pay dividends on the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, except for such rights or interest that may arise as a result of the Corporation paying a dividend or making a Distribution on the Common Stock in violation of the terms of this Section 2. 2.2 Participation Rights. Dividends shall be declared pro rata on the Common Stock and the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such holders, where each holder of shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is to be treated for this purpose as holding the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holders thereof would be entitled if they converted their shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock at the time of such dividend in accordance with Section 4 hereof. 2.3 Non Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend or Distribution provided for in this Section 2 shall be payable in property other than cash (other than a Common Stock Dividend), the value of such dividend or Distribution shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board. 3. Liquidation Rights . In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation; whether voluntary or involuntary, the funds and assets of the Corporation that may be legally distributed to the Corporation's shareholders (the Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed to shareholders in the following manner: 3.1 Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. The holders of each share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, equal in preference to any payment or Distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or Distribution) of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends on the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. If upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment to holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Common Stock then all of the remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata, according to the number of outstanding shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock held by each holder thereof. 3 3.2 Merger or Sale of Assets. A reorganization or any other consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, or any other sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 3 and the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled only to the rights contained in this Section 3. 3.3 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to shareholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined by the Board. 4. Conversion Rights . The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the Conversion Rights ): 4.1 Right to Convert . 4.1.1 Conversion Ratio and Stock Certificate . Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, beginning on the date the Holder acquired the shares of Preferred Stock, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into Fifty (50) shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (the Conversion Ratio ). Unless specifically requested by the Holder to be issued physical certificates for the Preferred Stock, the Corporation, itself or through its transfer agent, shall issue the Preferred Stock in book-entry form, or in other electronic format. The Corporation or its transfer agent shall issue to Holder a statement reflecting his holding of Preferred Stock, and shall deliver an updated statement to Holder upon request. 4.1.2 Termination of Conversion Rights . Subject to Section 4.3.1 in the case of a Contingency Event (as defined therein), in the event of a reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Corporation, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the first payment of any funds and assets distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock. 4.2 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall round up and issue one additional share of Common Stock to the holder, unless such rounding would cause the Holder to violate the conversion limitation outlined in Section 4.1.2, above, and in that case the fractional share shall be rounded down to the next whole share of Common Stock. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. 4 4.3 Mechanics of Conversion . 4.3.1 Notice of Conversion . The Holder has the right, at any time, at its election, to convert all or any number of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, at the Conversion Ratio defined in Section 4.1.1 above. A conversion notice (the Conversion Notice ), describing conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, and if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent (a Contingency Event ), may be delivered to Corporation by method of Holder s choice (including but not limited to email, facsimile, mail, overnight courier, or personal delivery). All conversions shall be cashless and not require further payment from the Holder. The Corporation shall be responsible for all expenses associated with processing the conversion, such as transfer agent expenses and Corporation s legal expenses. If no objection is delivered from the Corporation to the Holder, with respect to any variable or calculation reflected in the Conversion Notice within 24 hours of delivery of the Conversion Notice, the Corporation shall have been thereafter deemed to have irrevocably confirmed and irrevocably ratified such notice of conversion and waived any objection thereto. The Corporation shall promptly deliver the shares of Common Stock from any conversion to the Holder. 4.3.2 Reservation of Shares . The Corporation shall at all times while any share of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such corporate action to be taken as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing a series of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary so that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. 4.3.3 Effect of Conversion . All shares of Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. All shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and shall revert to the Corporation's authorized but unissued Preferred Stock. 4.3.4 No Further Adjustment . Upon any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Ratio of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be made with respect to the converted shares for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion. 5 4.4 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations . If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the date on which the first share of a series of Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation (such date referred to herein as the Original Issue Date for such series of Preferred Stock) effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Ratio for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Ratio for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this Section 4.4 shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. 4.5 Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Ratio for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Ratio then in effect by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and (b) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Ratio shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter such Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.5 as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (ii) no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. 6 4.6 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then and in each such event the holders of such series of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. 4.7 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution . If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, or otherwise other than by a stock split or combination, dividend, distribution, merger or consolidation covered by Sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 or 4.8), then in any such event each holder of such series of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change. 4.8 Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation . If there shall occur any consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not a series of Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash, or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections 4.5, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such consolidation or merger, provision shall be made that each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible, in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event, into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of such series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 3 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Ratio of such series of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock. 7 4.9 Certificate as to Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Ratio of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of any series of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (a) the Conversion Ratio of such series of Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock. 5. No Impairment . The Corporation will not, through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, including amending this Certificate of Designation, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 5 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock against impairment. This provision shall not restrict the Corporation from amending its Articles of Incorporation in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware and the terms hereof. 6. Call Provisions . The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be callable by the Company. 7. Redemption . The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable by the Company. 8. Notices . Any notices required by the provisions of this Certificate of Designation to be given to the holders of shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if sent by facsimile or overnight courier to the address appearing on the books of the Corporation, and shall be conclusively deemed given at the time of delivery if made during normal business hours, otherwise notice shall be deemed given on the next business day. 9. Voting Provisions . Each outstanding share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on an as converted basis on all matters to which the holders of the Corporation s Common Stock are entitled or required to vote, as calculated on the date of the vote. 10. Protective Provisions . So long as any shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative approval of the Holders of a majority of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a class), (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series C Preferred Stock or alter or amend this Certificate of Designations, (b) authorize or create any class of stock ranking as to distribution of assets upon a liquidation senior to the Series C Preferred Stock, (c) amend its certificate or articles of incorporation or other charter documents in breach of any of the provisions hereof, (d) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of the Corporation, or effect any liquidation event, or (e) enter into any agreement with respect to the foregoing. 8 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Certificate of Designation of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to be duly executed by its Chief Executive Officer and attested to by its Secretary this 16th day of October, 2017. /s/ Craig Holland /s/ Mick Donahoo By: Craig Holland By: Mick Donahoo Its: President Its: Secretary 9
