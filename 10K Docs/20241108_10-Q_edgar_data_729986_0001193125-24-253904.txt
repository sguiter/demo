For the adoption of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, United made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of available-for-sale

 debt securities and report accrued interest separately in Accrued interest receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Available-for-sale

 debt securities are placed on non-accrual
 status when we no longer expect to receive all contractual amounts due, which is generally at 90 days past due. Accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income when a security is placed on non-accrual
 status. Accordingly, United does not currently recognize an allowance for credit loss against accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale

 debt securities. The table above excludes accrued interest receivable of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, that is recorded in Accrued interest receivable.

 In determining whether or not a security is impaired, management considered the severity of the loss in conjunction with United s positive intent and the more likely than not ability to hold these securities to recovery of their cost basis or maturity. Generally, the significant amount of gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities at September 30, 2024 was the result of rising interest rates.

 to days past due as to principal or interest. However, regardless of delinquency status, if a loan is fully secured and in the process of collection and resolution of collection is expected in the near term (generally less than days), then the loan will not be placed on nonaccrual status. When interest accruals are discontinued, unpaid interest recognized in income in the current year is reversed, and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance for credit losses. United s method of income recognition for loans and leases that are classified as nonaccrual is to recognize interest income on a cash basis or apply the cash receipt to principal when the ultimate collectability of principal is in doubt. Nonaccrual loans and leases will not normally be returned to accrual status unless all past due principal and interest has been paid and the borrower has evidenced their ability to meet the contractual provisions of the note.

 United s estimate of future credit losses uses a lifetime methodology, derived from modeled loan performance based on the extensive historical experience of loans with similar risk characteristics, adjusted to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The historical loss experience used in United s credit loss models includes the impact of loan modifications provided to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and also includes the impact of projected loss severities as a result of loan defaults.

United categorizes loans and leases into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, underlying collateral (if any), public information and current economic trends, among other factors. 
 United uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass 

Special Mention 

Substandard 

Doubtful 
 For loans with a consumer credit exposure, United internally assigns a grade based upon an individual loan s delinquency status. United reviews and updates, as necessary, these grades on a quarterly basis. 

- 
 days are generally considered special mention. 
 A substandard loan with a corporate credit exposure is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt by the borrower. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. They require more intensive supervision by management. Substandard loans are generally characterized by current or expected unprofitable operations, inadequate debt service coverage, inadequate liquidity, or marginal capitalization. Repayment may depend on collateral or other credit risk mitigants. For some substandard loans, the likelihood of full collection of interest and principal may be in doubt and thus, placed on nonaccrual. For loans with a consumer credit exposure, loans that are days or more past due or that have been placed on nonaccrual are considered substandard. 
 A loan with corporate credit exposure is classified as doubtful if it has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable. A doubtful loan has a high probability of total or substantial loss, but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the loan, its classification as loss is deferred. Doubtful borrowers are usually in default, lack adequate liquidity or capital, and lack the resources necessary to remain an operating entity. Pending events can include mergers, acquisitions, liquidations, capital injections, the perfection of liens on additional collateral, the valuation of collateral, and refinancing. Generally, there are not any loans with a consumer credit exposure that are classified as doubtful. Usually, they are charged-off
 prior to such a classification.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other real estate owned OREO included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was and , respectively. OREO consists of real estate acquired in foreclosure or other settlement of loans. Such assets are carried at the lower of the investment in the assets or the fair value of the assets less estimated selling costs. Any adjustment to the fair value at the date of transfer is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent valuation adjustments as well as any costs relating to operating, holding or disposing of the property are recorded in other expense in the period incurred. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the recorded investment of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process was and , respectively. 
 and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to loans and leases that are included separately in Accrued interest receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. For all classes of loans and leases receivable, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become days past due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Interest received on nonaccrual loans and leases, generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal.

United estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level or term as well as reasonable and supportable forecast adjustments for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values or other relevant factors. A reversion to historical loss data occurs via a straight-line method during the year following the one-year
 reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

 United pools its loans and leases based on similar risk characteristics in estimating expected credit losses. United has identified the following portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods: 

Method: Probability of Default/Loss Given Default (PD/LGD)

Risk characteristics of commercial real estate owner-occupied loans and commercial other loans and leases are similar in that they are normally dependent upon the borrower s internal cash flow from operations to service debt. Commercial real estate nonowner-occupied loans differ in that cash flow to service debt is normally dependent on external income from third parties for use of the real estate such as rents, leases and room rates. Residential real estate loans are dependent upon individual borrowers who are affected by changes in general economic conditions, demand for housing and resulting residential real estate valuation. Construction and land development loans are impacted mainly by demand whether for new residential housing or for retail, industrial, office and other types of commercial construction within a given area. Consumer loan pool risk characteristics are influenced by general, regional and local economic conditions. 

and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is separately classified on the balance sheet and is included in other liabilities. The decrease in the reserve for lending-related commitments from December 31, 2023 was due mainly to a lower amount of loan commitments outstanding. The combined allowance for loan losses and reserve for lending-related commitments is considered the allowance for credit losses. 
 United s allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 increased or from December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by increased outstanding loan balances for the commercial real estate non-owner
 occupied, real estate construction and land development, and residential real estate loan segments as well as adjustments for the reasonable and supportable forecast increasing the reserve for the commercial real estate non-owner
 occupied segment, particularly as it relates to office loans. 
 The third quarter of 2024 qualitative adjustments include analyses of the following: 

Current conditions
 United considered the impact of inflation, interest rates, the banking regulatory environment, geopolitical conflict and the presidential election when making determinations related to factor adjustments for the external environment. United also considered portfolio trends related to economic and business conditions, collateral values for dependent loans; past due, nonaccrual and graded loans and leases; and concentrations of credit. 

Reasonable and supportable forecasts
 The forecast is determined on a portfolio-by-portfolio

 basis by relating the correlation of real GDP and the unemployment rate to loss rates to forecasts of those variables. The reasonable and supportable forecast selection is subjective in nature and requires more judgment compared to the other components of the allowance. Assumptions for the economic variables were the following: 

The forecast for real GDP in the third quarter remained relatively consistent with the second quarter projections of for 2024 (a decrease of from the second quarter), for 2025 and for 2026. The unemployment rate forecast 
increased by for 2024 to while 2025 shifted up slightly to from and 2026 also increased slightly to from .

Greater risk of loss is probable in the office portfolio due to continued hybrid and remote work that may be exacerbated by future economic conditions as well as higher interest rates, cap rates and the uncertainty surrounding appraised values of the collateral. United recognized this greater risk of loss by increasing the loss multiple relating to the historical loss experience of the office portfolio. 

Reversion to historical loss data occurs via a straight-line method during the year following the one-year
 reasonable and supportable forecast period.

At September 30, 2024, United had a total of twenty statutory business trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing or participating in pools of trust preferred capital securities Capital Securities with the proceeds invested in junior subordinated debt securities Debentures of United. The Debentures, which are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future senior indebtedness and certain other financial obligations of United, are the sole assets of the trusts and United s payment under the Debentures is the sole source of revenue for the trusts. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the Debentures was and , respectively, and was included in the category of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets entitled Other long-term borrowings. The Capital Securities are not included as a component of shareholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. United fully and unconditionally guarantees each individual trust s obligations under the Capital Securities. 
 Under the provisions of the subordinated debt, United has the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated debt at any time, or from time to time, for periods not exceeding . If interest payments on the subordinated debt are deferred, the dividends on the Capital Securities are also deferred. Interest on the subordinated debt is cumulative. 
 In accordance with the fully-phased in Basel III Capital Rules as published by United s primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, United is unable to consider the Capital Securities as Tier 1 capital, but rather the Capital Securities are included as a component of United s Tier 2 capital. United can include the Capital Securities in its Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis. 
 and of loan commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximately 41 of which contractually expire within . Excluded in the December 31, 2023 amount above were commitments to extend credit of related to mortgage loan funding commitments of United s previous mortgage banking segment which were of a short-term nature. 

and of commercial letters of credit outstanding. A standby letter of credit is generally contingent upon the failure of a customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party. United has issued standby letters of credit of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, United has determined that substantially all of its letters of credit are renewed on an annual basis and the fees associated with these letters of credit are immaterial. 
 Mortgage Banking 

Related to its mortgage banking activities, United provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or where the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities. United evaluates the merits of each claim and estimates its reserve based on actual and expected claims received and considers the historical amounts paid to settle such claims. United s reserve was immaterial as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 United has derivative counter-party risk that may arise from the possible inability of United s mortgage banking third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts. United works with mortgage banking third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk. United does not expect any third-party investor to fail to meet its obligation. 
 Legal Proceedings 

United and its subsidiaries are currently involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. On at least a quarterly basis, United assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with all pending or threatened claims and litigation, utilizing the most recent information available. On a matter-by-matter

 basis, an accrual for loss is established for those matters which United believes it is probable that a loss may be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, each accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any subsequent developments. Accordingly, management s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, no accrual is established. 
 Management is vigorously pursuing all its legal and factual defenses and, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that all such litigation will be resolved with no material effect on United s financial statements. 
 Regulatory Matters 

A variety of consumer products, including mortgage and deposit products, and certain fees and charges related to such products, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny. It is possible that regulatory authorities could bring enforcement actions, including civil money penalties, or take other actions against United in regard to these consumer products. United could also determine of its own accord, or be required by regulators, to refund or otherwise make remediation payments to customers in connection with these products. It is not possible at this time for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss related to such matters. 

. The derivatives were intended to hedge the changes in cash flows associated with floating rate FHLB borrowings. One of these two interest rate swap derivatives matured during the third quarter of 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, United has determined that no forecasted transactions related to its remaining cash flow hedge resulted in gains or losses pertaining to cash flow hedge reclassification from AOCI to income because the forecasted transactions became probable of not occurring. United estimates that will be reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to interest expense over the next 12-months
 following September 30, 2024 related to the cash flow hedge. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is six years. 
 At inception of a hedge relationship, United formally documents the hedged item, the particular risk management objective, the nature of the risk being hedged, the derivative being used, how effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed and how the ineffectiveness of the hedge will be measured. United also assesses hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis using regression analysis. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured by using the change in fair value method. The change in fair value method compares the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative to the change in the fair value of the hedged exposure, attributable to changes in the benchmark rate. 
 United is subject to the Dodd-Frank Act clearing requirement for eligible derivatives. United has executed and cleared eligible derivatives through the London Clearing House LCH ). Variation margin at the LCH is distinguished as settled-to-market

 and settled daily based on the prior day value, rather than collateralized-to-market.

 The daily settlement of the derivative exposure does not change or reset the contractual terms of the instrument. The total notional amount of interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges cleared through the LCH include for asset derivatives as of September 30, 2024. Balances related to LCH are presented as a single unit of account with the fair value of the designated cash flow interest rate swap asset being reduced by variation margin posted by (with) the applicable counterparty and reported in the following table on a net basis. The related fair value on a net basis approximates . 
 United through its mortgage banking channel enters into interest rate lock commitments to finance residential mortgage loans with its customers. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by United. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. Market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale is managed using corresponding forward mortgage loan sales contracts. United is a party to these forward mortgage loan sales contracts to sell loans with servicing either released or retained and short sales of mortgage-backed securities. When the interest rate is locked with the borrower, the rate lock commitment, forward sale agreement, and mortgage-backed security position are undesignated derivatives and marked to fair value through earnings. The fair value of the rate lock derivative is measured using valuations from investors for loans with similar characteristics as well as considering the probability of the loan closing (i.e. the pull-through rate) with some adjusted for the Company s actual sales experience versus the investor s indicated pricing. Fair values of TBA mortgage-backed securities are measured using valuations from investors for mortgage-backed securities with similar characteristics. Income from mortgage banking activities includes the gain recognized for the period presented and associated elements of fair value.

Derivative contracts involve the risk of dealing with both bank customers and institutional derivative counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. United s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional amount of the contract. The Company s agreements generally contain provisions that limit the unsecured exposure up to an agreed upon threshold. Additionally, the Company attempts to minimize credit risk through certain approval processes established by management.

t traded in active markets, United looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities and classifies such items as Level 2. Nevertheless, certain assets and liabilities are 
 t actively traded in observable markets and United must use alternative valuation techniques using unobservable inputs to determine a fair value and classifies such items as Level 3. For assets and liabilities that are 
 t actively traded, the fair value measurement is based primarily upon estimates that require significant judgment. Therefore, the results may 
 t be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there are inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values. The level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant in the fair value measurement.

 In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the following describes the valuation techniques used by United to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. 
 Securities available for sale and equity securities
: Securities available for sale and equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available Level 1 ). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Using a market approach valuation methodology, third party vendors compile prices based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, and To Be Announced prices Level 2 ). Management internally reviews the fair values provided by third party vendors on a monthly basis. Management also performs a quarterly price testing analysis at the individual security level which compares the pricing provided by the third party vendors to an independent pricing source s valuation of the same securities. Variances that are deemed to be material are reviewed by management. Additionally, to further assess the reliability of the information received from third party vendors, management obtains documentation from third party vendors related to the sources, methodologies, and inputs utilized in valuing securities classified as Level 2. Management analyzes this information to ensure the underlying assumptions appear reasonable. Management also obtains an independent service auditor s report from third party vendors to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate controls are in place over the valuation process. Upon completing its review of the pricing from third party vendors at September 30, 2024, management determined that the prices provided by 

to with a weighted average increase of . 
 Derivatives
: United utilizes interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to interest rate risk and variability of cash flows associated to changes in the underlying interest rate of the hedged item. These hedging interest rate swaps are classified as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. United utilizes third-party vendors for derivative valuation purposes. These vendors determine the appropriate fair value based on a net present value calculation of the cash flows related to the interest rate swaps using primarily observable market inputs such as interest rate yield curves Level 2 ). Valuation adjustments to derivative fair values for liquidity and credit risk are also taken into consideration, as well as the likelihood of default by United and derivative counterparties, the net counterparty exposure and the remaining maturities of the positions. Values obtained from third party vendors are typically not adjusted by management. Management internally reviews the derivative values provided by third party vendors on a quarterly basis. All derivative values are tested for reasonableness by management utilizing a net present value calculation. 
 For a fair value hedge, the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognized on the balance sheet as either a freestanding asset or liability with a corresponding adjustment to the hedged financial instrument. Subsequent adjustments due to changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge are offset in current period earnings either in interest income or interest expense depending on the nature of the hedged financial instrument. For a cash flow hedge, the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognized on the balance sheet as either a freestanding asset or liability with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity, net of tax. Subsequent adjustments due to changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are offset to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same line associated with the forecasted transaction when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
 The Company records its interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales commitments at fair value determined as the amount that would be required to settle each of these derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date. In the normal course of business, United, through its mortgage banking channel, enters into contractual interest rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers with fixed expiration dates. The commitments become effective when the borrowers lock-in 
 a specified interest rate within the timeframes established by the mortgage companies. All borrowers are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment. Interest rate risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the interest rate lock by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to the investor. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, United, through its mortgage banking channel, enters into either a forward sales contract to sell loans to investors or a TBA mortgage-backed security. Fair values of TBA mortgage-backed securities are measured using valuations from investors for mortgage-backed securities with similar characteristics Level 2 ). The forward sales contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments. These valuations fall into a Level 2 category. The interest rate lock commitments are recorded at fair value which is measured using valuations from investors for loans with similar characteristics Level 2 with some adjusted for the Company s actual sales experience versus the investor s indicated pricing Level 3 ). The unobservable input for Level 3 valuations is the Company s historical sales prices. For September 30, 2024, the range of historical sales prices increased the investor s indicated pricing by a range of to with a weighted average increase of .

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market

accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
 The following describes the valuation techniques used by United to measure certain financial assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements. 
 Individually assessed loans
: In the determination of the allowance for loan losses, loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. When management determines that foreclosure is probable or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. Fair value is measured using a market approach based on the value of the collateral securing the loans. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using comparable property sales Level 2 ). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process of construction or if an appraisal of the real estate property is over two years old, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports Level 3 ). For individually assessed loans, a specific reserve is established through the allowance for loan losses, if necessary, by estimating the fair value of the underlying collateral on a nonrecurring basis. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

fair value measurement of intangible assets was made during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs ):
 A MSR asset represents the amount by which the present value of the estimated future net cash flows to be received from servicing loans are expected to more than adequately compensate the Company for performing the servicing. The Company initially measures servicing assets and liabilities retained related to the sale of residential loans held for sale at fair value. For subsequent measurement purposes, the Company measures servicing assets and liabilities using the amortization method on a quarterly basis. The quarterly determination of fair value of servicing rights is provided by a third party and is estimated using a present value cash flow model. The most important assumptions used in the valuation model are the anticipated rate of the loan prepayments and discount rates. Although some assumptions in determining fair value are based on standards used by market participants, some are based on unobservable inputs and therefore are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The unobservable inputs for Level 3 valuations are market discount rates, anticipated prepayment speeds, projected delinquency rates, and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs. During the third quarter of 2024, United sold its remaining balance of MSRs. For the unobservable inputs used in the valuation of MSRs at December 31, 2023, refer to Note 8 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company did t record any temporary impairment of MSRs in the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

() Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The following methods and assumptions were used by United in estimating its fair value disclosures for other financial instruments: 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets fair values. 
 Securities held to maturity and other securities
: The estimated fair values of securities held to maturity are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data. Any securities held to maturity, not valued based upon the methods above, are valued based on a discounted cash flow methodology using appropriately adjusted discount rates reflecting nonperformance and liquidity risks. Other securities consist mainly of shares of Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock that do not have readily determinable fair values and are carried at cost. 
 Loans and leases
: The fair values of certain mortgage loans (e.g., one-to-four

 family residential), credit card loans, and other consumer loans are based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair values of other loans and leases (e.g., commercial real estate and rental property mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans, financial institution loans and agricultural loans) are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market interest rates currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms to borrowers of similar creditworthiness, which include adjustments for liquidity concerns. For acquired PCD loans, fair value is assumed to equal United s carrying value, which represents the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows, as adjusted for any Allowance for Credit Losses recorded for these loans. 
 Deposits
: The fair values of demand deposits (e.g., interest and noninterest checking, regular savings and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair values of fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.

United adopted a clawback policy that applies to named executive officers and other executive officers and permits the Committee to cancel certain awards and to recoup gains realized from previous awards should United be required to prepare an accounting restatement due to materially inaccurate performance metrics. A Form S-8

Restricted Stock Units 

Under the 2020 LTI Plan, United may grant restricted stock units RSUs to key employees. These awards help align the interests of these employees with the interests of the shareholders of United by providing economic value directly related to the performance of the Company. These RSU grants could be time-vested RSUs, performance-vested RSUs, or a combination of both. Currently, time-vested RSUs vest ratably over three years from the date of grant. Performance-vested RSUs cliff-vest after assessment of the Company s performance over a period of three years. The number of performance-vested RSUs that vest is determined by two metrics measured relative to peers: Return on Average Tangible Common Equity ROATCE and Total Shareholder Return TSR ). Based on ASC Topic 718, the ROATCE comparison is considered a performance condition while the TSR comparison is considered a market condition. There will be no payout of the performance-vested awards if the threshold performance is not achieved. United communicates the specific threshold, target, and maximum performance-vested RSU awards and performance targets to the applicable key employees at the beginning of a performance period. Dividends are accrued but not paid in respect to the awards until the RSUs vest. The holder does not have the right to vote the shares during the time and performance periods. The value of the time-vested RSUs and the performance-vested, based on the performance condition, RSUs awarded is established as the fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant. The value of the performance-vested, based on the market condition, RSUs awarded is estimated through the use of a Monte Carlo valuation model as of the grant date. The Company recognizes expense on the RSUs in accordance with ASC Topic 718.

statutory business trusts that were created for the purpose of raising funds that originally qualified for Tier I regulatory capital. As previously discussed, these trusts now are considered Tier II regulatory capital. These trusts, of which several were acquired through bank acquisitions, issued or participated in pools of trust preferred capital securities to third-party investors with the proceeds invested in junior subordinated debt securities of United. The Company, through a small capital contribution, owns of the voting equity shares of each trust. The assets, liabilities, operations, and cash flows of each trust are solely related to the issuance, administration, and repayment of the preferred equity securities held by third-party investors. United fully and unconditionally guarantees the obligations of each trust and is obligated to redeem the junior subordinated debentures upon maturity. 
 United does not consolidate these trusts as it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities because United s wholly owned and indirect wholly owned statutory trust subsidiaries do not have a controlling financial interest in the VIEs. A controlling financial interest is present when an enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The enterprise with a controlling financial interest, known as the primary beneficiary, consolidates the VIE.

Item 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 to encourage corporations to provide investors with information about the company s anticipated future financial performance, goals, and strategies. The act provides a safe haven for such disclosure; in other words, protection from unwarranted litigation if actual results are not the same as management expectations. United desires to provide its shareholders with sound information about past performance and future trends. Consequently, any forward-looking statements contained in this report, in a report incorporated by reference to this report, or made by management of United in this report, in any other reports and filings, in press releases and in oral statements, involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of the words expect, may, could, intend, project, estimate, believe, anticipate, and other words of similar meaning. Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates, which although believed to be reasonable, may turn out to be incorrect. Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon these estimates and statements. United cannot assure that any of these statements, estimates, or beliefs will be realized and actual results may differ from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. United undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. PENDING ACQUISITION On May 9, 2024, United entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Piedmont Bancorp, Inc., a Georgia corporation Piedmont ). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Piedmont will merge with and into United (the Merger ), with United as the surviving corporation in the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, Piedmont s wholly-owned subsidiary, The Piedmont Bank, a state bank chartered under the laws of the State of Georgia, will merge with and into United s wholly-owned subsidiary, United Bank, a state bank chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the Bank Merger ), with United Bank as the surviving bank in the Bank Merger. As of September 30, 2024, Piedmont has total assets of approximately 2.2 billion, total loans of approximately 1.9 billion, total liabilities of approximately 2.0 billion, total deposits of approximately 2.0 billion, and total shareholders equity of approximately 207 million. Piedmont is the holding company for The Piedmont Bank, a Georgia state-chartered bank, with sixteen locations in the State of Georgia. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS During the first quarter of 2024, United consolidated its mortgage delivery channels by consolidating George Mason s and Crescent s mortgage origination and sales business with United Bank. United had previously exited the third-party origination TPO business during the fourth quarter of 2023 as part of this consolidation. United continues to offer mortgage products through its bank mortgage channel with previous George Mason offices re-branded under the United umbrella. The consolidation streamlined operations and will enhance the customer experience. Based on this consolidation of its mortgage delivery channels and an analysis performed at September 30, 2024 in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, United has concluded that it operates only in one reportable segment community banking.

This discussion and the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of United Bankshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Management has evaluated all significant events and transactions that occurred after September 30, 2024, but prior to the date these financial statements were issued, for potential recognition or disclosure required in these financial statements. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this document. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This discussion and analysis contains certain financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP. Under SEC Regulation G, public companies making disclosures containing financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure, certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a statement of the company s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, United has presented a non-GAAP financial measure because it believes that this measure provides meaningful additional information to assist in the evaluation of United s results of operations or financial position. Presentation of a non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with how United s management evaluates its performance internally and this non-GAAP financial measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the banking industry. Specifically, this discussion contains certain references to financial measures identified as tax-equivalent FTE net interest income and return on average tangible equity. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures to be helpful in understanding United s results of operations or financial position. Net interest income is presented in this discussion on a tax-equivalent basis. The tax-equivalent basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, United s management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. United uses this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition. Average tangible equity is calculated as GAAP total shareholders equity minus total intangible assets. Tangible equity can thus be considered a more conservative valuation of the company. When considering net income, a return on average tangible equity can be calculated. Management provides a return on average equity to facilitate the understanding of as well as to assess the quality and composition of United s capital structure. This measure, along with others, is used by management to analyze capital adequacy and performance. However, this non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Where the non-GAAP financial measure is used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as reconciliation to that comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a statement of the company s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure, can be found within this discussion and analysis. Investors should recognize that United s presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure might not be comparable to a similarly titled measure at other companies. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting and reporting policies of United conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments, which are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the

Table of Contents 

sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, the calculation of the income tax provision, and the use of fair value measurements to account for certain financial instruments to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. United s critical accounting policies involving the significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 were unchanged from the policies disclosed in United s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 within the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL CONDITION United s total assets as of September 30, 2024 were 29.86 billion, which was a decrease of 63.22 million or less than 1 from December 31, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease of 587.34 million or 14.24 in investment securities, a decrease of 9.77 million or 17.36 in loans held for sale, and a decrease of 19.20 million or 6.95 in other assets. These decreases in assets were mostly offset by a 309.89 million or 19.38 increase in cash and cash equivalents and a 262.88 million or 1.23 increase in loans, net of unearned income. Total liabilities decreased 259.80 million or 1.03 from year-end 2023. Borrowings decreased 1.26 billion or 63.63 , which were partially offset by a 1.01 billion or 4.42 increase in deposits. Shareholders equity increased 196.58 million or 4.12 . The following discussion explains in more detail the changes in financial condition by major category. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 increased 309.89 million or 19.38 from year-end 2023. In particular, interest-bearing deposits with other banks increased 288.98 million or 21.56 as United placed more cash in an interest-bearing account with the Federal Reserve while cash and due from banks increased 20.82 million or 8.10 . Federal funds sold increased 83 thousand or 7.09 . During the first nine months of 2024, net cash of 309.17 million and 405.57 million were provided by operating and investing activities, respectively, while net cash of 404.86 million was used in financing activities. See the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for data on cash and cash equivalents provided and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Securities Total investment securities at September 30, 2024 decreased 587.34 million or 14.24 . Securities available for sale decreased 546.88 million or 14.44 . This change in securities available for sale reflects 1.41 billion in purchases, 2.06 billion in sales, maturities and calls of securities, and an increase of 93.37 million in market value. The majority of the sales activity was related to asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and state and political subdivision securities. Equity securities were 9.08 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 137 thousand or 1.53 due mainly to a net increase in fair value. Other investment securities decreased 40.60 million or 12.32 from year-end 2023, due to a redemption of FHLB stock due to a decline in FHLB borrowings.

Table of Contents 

During the third quarter of 2024, United did not recognize any credit losses on its available for sale investment securities. Management does not believe that any individual security with an unrealized loss as of September 30, 2024 is impaired. United believes the decline in value resulted from changes in market interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity, not a deterioration of credit. Based on a review of each of the securities in the available for sale investment portfolio, management concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that it would be able to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate interest payments on such securities. United has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature. As of September 30, 2024, there was no allowance for credit losses related to the Company s available for sale securities. However, United acknowledges that any securities in an unrealized loss position may be sold in future periods in response to significant, unanticipated changes in asset/liability management decisions, unanticipated future market movements or business plan changes. During the third quarter of 2024, United sold approximately 197 million of available for sale securities at a loss of 6.88 million. The securities sold were comprised of approximately 66 in floating rate securities and approximately 34 in fixed rate securities. Approximately 150 million of the sale proceeds were reinvested in available for sale securities with an average yield of 5.1 . Further information regarding the amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities, including remaining maturities as well as a more detailed discussion of management s impairment analysis, is presented in Note 3 to the unaudited Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale were 46.49 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9.77 million or 17.36 from year-end 2023. Loan sales in the secondary market exceeded originations during the first nine months of 2024. Loan originations for the first nine months of 2024 were 513.56 million while loans sales were 523.33 million. Portfolio Loans Loans, net of unearned income, increased 262.88 million or 1.23 . Since year-end 2023, commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased 111.38 million or less than 1 as a result of a 286.81 million or 3.45 increase in commercial real estate loans, which was partially offset by a 175.43 million or 4.91 decrease in commercial loans (not secured by real estate). Residential real estate loans increased 147.71 million or 2.80 and construction and land development loans increased 221.95 million or 7.05 . Consumer loans decreased 223.18 million or 20.96 due to a decrease in indirect automobile financing. The following table summarizes the changes in the major loan classes since year-end 2023:

Other Assets Other assets decreased 19.20 million or 6.95 from year-end 2023. Deferred tax assets decreased 15.61 million due to an increase in the fair value of AFS securities, dealer reserve decreased 6.35 million due to a decrease in indirect automobile financing, core deposit intangibles decreased 2.73 million due to amortization, and OREO properties decreased 2.45 million due to sales of consumer OREO properties. Partially offsetting these decreases in other assets was a 6.87 million increase in income tax receivable due to timing differences. Deposits Deposits represent United s primary source of funding.

In terms of composition, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 110.98 million or 1.80 while interest-bearing deposits increased 1.12 billion or 6.72 from December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits consist of demand deposit and noninterest bearing money market MMDA account balances. The 110.98 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits was due mainly to a 151.64 million or 3.38 decrease in commercial noninterest-bearing deposits and a 55.76 million or 4.08 decrease in personal noninterest deposits. Public noninterest-bearing deposits increased 92.11 million or 58.48 and official checks increased 34.24 million or 57.68 .

In particular, commercial MMDAs increased 577.54 million while personal MMDAs and public funds MMDAs increased 151.26 million and 36.83 million, respectively. Time deposits under 100,000 increased 104.41 million or 9.79 from year-end 2023. This increase in time deposits under 100,000 was the result of a 114.63 million increase in fixed rate Certificates of Deposits CDs under 100,000. Partially offsetting this increase in deposits under 100,000 was a 5.69 million decrease in CDs under 100,000 obtained through the use of deposit listing services. Since year-end 2023, time deposits over 100,000 increased 98.68 million or 4.36 as fixed rate CDs increased 341.79 million and public funds CDs increased 37.37 million.

Net income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 95.27 million and 278.59 million, respectively, as compared to earnings of 96.16 million and 286.92 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Earnings for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 decreased primarily due to higher provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income partially offset by a higher net interest income and a lower income tax expense.

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 230.26 million, which was relatively flat from the third quarter of 2023, increasing 1.80 million or less than 1 . The slight increase of 1.80 million in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased 25.81 million while total interest expense increased 24.01 million from the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 678.46 million, a decrease of 11.77 million or 1.71 from the first nine months of 2023. The decrease of 11.77 million in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased 93.94 million while total interest expense increased 105.72 million from the first nine months of 2023. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.54 million, or 2.01 , from the second quarter of 2024. Total interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 8.54 million while total interest expense increased 4.00 million from the second quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses was 6.94 million and 18.46 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, while the provision for credit losses was 5.95 million and 24.28 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. The provision for credit losses was 5.78 million for the second quarter of 2024. For the third quarter of 2024, noninterest income was 31.94 million, which was a decrease of 1.72 million or 5.11 from the third quarter of 2023. This decrease in noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was due mainly to decreases of 6.53 million and 3.01 million, respectively, in net losses on investment securities transactions and in income from mortgage banking activities driven by lower mortgage loan sales volume partially offset by the gain on the sale of MSRs. Noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 94.38 million which was a decrease of 7.21 million or 7.09 from the first nine months of 2023. This decrease in noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 was due mainly to decreases of 8.10 million and 4.01 million, respectively, in income from mortgage banking activities driven by lower mortgage loan sales volume and mortgage loan servicing income due mainly to a decline in net gains on the sales of MSRs and a lower amount of loans serviced. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in fees from brokerage services and income from bank-owned life insurance as well as lower net losses on investment securities transactions. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income increased 1.72 million or 5.69 primarily due the previously mentioned gain on the sale of MSRs and increased income from mortgage banking activities partially offset by an increase in net losses on investment securities transactions. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, noninterest expense was relatively flat from the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, increasing 109 thousand and 2.92 million, respectively. Both of these increases were less than 1 . For the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, several categories of noninterest expense increased which were largely offset by decreases in other categories. For the first nine months of 2024, the increase of 2.92 million in noninterest expense from the first nine months of 2023 was driven primarily by increases of 3.30 million in employee compensation and 2.10 million in FDIC insurance expense partially offset by decreases of 2.21 million in mortgage loan servicing expense and 1.42 million in other expense. The increase in employee compensation was driven by higher employee incentives, base salaries, and employee severance associated with the previously announced mortgage delivery channel consolidation partially offset by lower employee commissions related to mortgage banking production. The increase in FDIC insurance expense was driven by 1.81 million of expense recognized in the first quarter of 2024 for the FDIC special assessment. The decrease in mortgage loan servicing expense was driven by the sales of MSRs. The decrease in other noninterest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the expense for the reserve for unfunded loan commitments driven by a decrease in the outstanding balance of loan commitments. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was relatively flat from the second quarter of 2024, increasing 565 thousand or less than 1 . Income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 were 24.65 million as compared to 24.78 million for the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense was 18.88 million for the second quarter of 2024. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, income tax expense was 64.93 million and 72.68 million, respectively. For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, United s effective tax rate was 20.56 and 16.36 , respectively. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, United s effective tax rate was 20.49 . The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 18.90 and 20.21 , respectively. The following discussion explains in more detail the consolidated results of operations by major category.

Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the primary component of United s earnings. It is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets. Net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in market interest rates. Such changes, and their impact on net interest income in 2024 and 2023, are presented below. Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 230.26 million, which was relatively flat from the third quarter of 2023, increasing 1.80 million less than 1 . The increase of 1.80 million in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased 25.81 million while total interest expense increased 24.01 million from the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 678.46 million, a decrease of 11.77 million or 1.71 from the first nine months of 2023. The decrease of 11.77 million in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased 93.94 million while total interest expense increased 105.72 million from the first nine months of 2023. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.54 million or 2.01 from the second quarter of 2024. The 4.54 million increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased 8.54 million while total interest expense increased 4.00 million from the second quarter of 2024. For the purpose of this remaining discussion, net interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets. The tax-equivalent basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, United s management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. United uses this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition. Tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was flat from the third quarter of 2023, increasing 1.80 million, or less than 1 . The slight increase in tax-equivalent net interest income was primarily due to a higher yield on average net loans and loans held for sale, a decrease in average long-term borrowings, organic loan growth, and an increase in average short-term investments. This increase in tax-equivalent net interest income was partially offset by the impact of deposit rate repricing and an increase in average interest-bearing deposits. The yield on average earning assets increased 33 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 to 5.85 driven by an increase in the yield on average net loans and loans held for sale of 28 basis points. Average long-term borrowings decreased 842.16 million, or 52.94 , from the third quarter of 2023. Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 increased 363.70 million, or 1.41 , from the third quarter of 2023 due to a 610.37 million increase in average net loans and loans held for sale and a 535.24 million increase in average short-term investments partially offset by a 781.91 million decrease in average investment securities. The yield on average interest-bearing deposits increased 58 basis points from the third quarter of 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 1.41 billion, or 8.79 , from the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 3.52 and 3.54 , respectively. Tax-equivalent net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 12.36 million, or 1.78 , from the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest income was primarily due to higher interest expense driven by deposit rate repricing, an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, and a decrease in acquired loan accretion income. These decreases were partially offset by a higher yield on average net loans and loans held for sale, organic loan growth, and a decrease in average long-term borrowings. The yield on average interest-bearing deposits increased 88 basis points from the first nine months of 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 1.37 billion from the first nine months of 2023. Acquired loan accretion income for the first nine months of 2024 of 7.29 million was a decrease of 1.24 million from the first nine months of 2023. The yield on average earning assets increased 46 basis points from the first nine months of 2023 to 5.78 driven by an increase in the yield on average net loans and loans held for sale of 39 basis points. Average net loans and loans held for sale increased 773.33 million from the first nine months of 2023. Average long-term borrowings decreased 924.21 million from the first nine months of 2023. Additionally, average investment securities decreased 857.35 million, or 18.84 , from the first nine months of 2023 while the yield on average investment securities increased 36 basis points from the first nine months of 2023. The net interest margin for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 3.49 and 3.56 , respectively.

Table of Contents 

On a linked-quarter basis, tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 also increased 4.50 million, or 1.99 , from the second quarter of 2024. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income was driven by an increase in average short-term investments, a higher yield on average net loans and loans held for sale, and a decrease in average long-term borrowings partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits as well as a higher average rate paid on deposits. Average short-term investments increased 457.01 million, or 49.12 , from the second quarter of 2024 primarily driven by cash received from deposit growth. The yield on average net loans and loans held for sale increased 6 basis points to 6.20 for the third quarter of 2024. As previously disclosed, the second quarter of 2024 included a 654 thousand interest recovery from a commercial real estate nonaccrual loan payoff. Average long-term borrowings decreased 541.80 million, or 41.99 , from the second quarter of 2024. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 659.24 million, or 3.94 , from the second quarter of 2024. The yield on average interest-bearing deposits increased 10 basis points to 3.28 for the third quarter of 2024. The net interest margin of 3.52 for the third quarter of 2024 was an increase of 2 basis points from the net interest margin of 3.50 for the second quarter of 2024. United s tax-equivalent net interest income also includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. The following table provides the discount/premium and net accretion impact to tax-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was 6.94 million and 18.46 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to a provision for credit losses of 5.95 million and 24.28 million for third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. On a linked-quarter basis, the provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2024 was 5.78 million. United s provision for credit losses relates to its portfolio of loans and leases, held-to-maturity securities and interest receivable on loans which are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the provision for loan and lease losses was 6.94 million as compared to a provision for loan and lease losses of 5.95 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The higher amount of provision expense for the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a greater amount of charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The provision for loan and lease losses for the first nine months of 2024 was 18.46 million as compared to a provision for loan and lease losses of 24.28 million for the first nine months of 2023. The lower amount of provision expense for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was mainly due to qualitative adjustment factors and reasonable and supportable forecast assumptions regarding future economic expectations. Net charge-offs were 3.60 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net charge-offs of 1.78 million for the same quarter in 2023. Net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 were 6.93 million as compared to net charge-offs of 4.14 million for the first nine months of 2023. The higher amount of net charge-offs for 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to increased charge-offs within the consumer loan portfolio. On a linked-quarter basis, the provision for loan and lease losses was 6.94 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a provision for loan and lease losses of 5.78 million for the second quarter of 2024. The higher amount of provision expense on a linked-quarter basis was due mainly to increased charge-offs within the consumer loan portfolio. Net charge-offs were 1.26 million for the second quarter of 2024. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases, net of unearned income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 0.07 and 0.04 as compared to annualized net charge-offs of 0.03 for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases, net of unearned income for the second quarter of 2024 were 0.02 .

The increase of 21.53 million in nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was due mainly to the transfer to nonaccrual of one significant commercial lending relationship and one large residential real estate relationship. United maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses and a reserve for lending-related commitments. The combined allowance for loan losses and reserve for lending-related commitments is considered the allowance for credit losses. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was 308.74 million as compared to 303.94 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 270.77 million as compared to 259.24 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by increased outstanding loan balances for the commercial real estate non-owner occupied, real estate construction and development, and residential real estate portfolios as well as increased reasonable and supportable forecast adjustments for the commercial real estate

nonowner-occupied office portfolio. As a percentage of loans and leases, net of unearned income, the allowance for loan losses was 1.25 at September 30, 2024 and 1.21 at December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans and leases or coverage ratio was 415.03 and 569.78 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in this ratio was due mainly to an increase in nonperforming loans. United continues to evaluate risks which may impact its loan and lease portfolios. Reserves are initially determined based on losses identified from the PD/LGD and Cohort models which utilize the Company s historical information. Then, any qualitative adjustments are applied to account for the Company s view of current conditions, the future and other factors. The third quarter of 2024 qualitative adjustments include analyses of the following: 

Current conditions United considered the impact of inflation, interest rates, the banking regulatory environment, geopolitical conflict and the presidential election when making determinations related to factor adjustments for the external environment. United also considered portfolio trends related to economic and business conditions, collateral values for dependent loans; past due, nonaccrual and graded loans and leases; and concentrations of credit. 

Reasonable and supportable forecasts The forecast is determined on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis by relating the correlation of real GDP and the unemployment rate to loss rates to forecasts of those variables. The reasonable and supportable forecast selection is subjective in nature and requires more judgment compared to the other components of the allowance. Assumptions for the economic variables were the following: 

The forecast for real GDP in the third quarter remained relatively consistent with the second quarter projections of 2.00 for 2024 (a decrease of 0.10 from the second quarter), 2.00 for 2025 and 2.00 for 2026. The unemployment rate forecast increased by 0.40 for 2024 to 4.40 while 2025 shifted up slightly to 4.40 from 4.20 and 2026 also increased slightly to 4.30 from 4.10 . 

Greater risk of loss is probable in the office portfolio due to continued hybrid and remote work that may be exacerbated by future economic conditions as well as higher interest rates, cap rates and the uncertainty surrounding appraised values of the collateral. United recognized this greater risk of loss by increasing the loss multiple relating to the historical loss experience of the office portfolio. 

Reversion to historical loss data occurs via a straight-line method during the year following the one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. United s review of the allowance for loan and lease losses at September 30, 2024 produced increased reserves in three of the four loan categories as compared to December 31, 2023. The allowance related to the commercial, financial agricultural loan pool, consisting of the owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate and other commercial loan segments, increased 6.33 million due to increased outstanding balances, increased allocations for individually assessed loans and increased reasonable and supportable forecast adjustments particularly as it pertains to office loans. The residential real estate segment reserve increased 5.61 million due primarily to increased outstanding balances while also impacted by a slight downgrade in the adjustment for past due, nonaccrual and graded loans. The real estate construction and development loan segment reserve increased 2.35 million due to increased outstanding balances. The consumer loan segment reserve decreased 2.76 million primarily due to a decrease in outstanding balances. An allowance is established for estimated lifetime losses for loans that are individually assessed. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases are regularly reviewed to identify expected credit losses. A loan is individually assessed for expected credit losses when the loan does not share similar characteristics with other loans in the portfolio. Measuring expected credit losses of a loan requires judgment and estimates, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates. Expected credit losses are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective rate or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an expected credit loss has occurred. The allowance for loans and leases that were individually assessed was 19.43 million at September 30, 2024 and 13.15 million at December 31, 2023. In comparison to the prior year-end, this element of the allowance increased 6.28 million due to the downgrade of a commercial real estate non-owner occupied relationship secured by office collateral as well as an unsecured relationship with a governmental-type entity.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses of 308.74 million at September 30, 2024 is adequate to provide for expected losses on existing loans and lending-related commitments based on information currently available. United s loan administration policies are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in terms of loan approval and credit quality. The commercial loan portfolio is monitored for possible concentrations of credit in one or more industries. Management has lending limits as a percentage of capital per type of credit concentration in an effort to ensure adequate diversification within the portfolio. Most of United s commercial loans are secured by real estate located in West Virginia, southeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. It is the opinion of management that these commercial loans do not pose any unusual risks and that adequate consideration has been given to these loans in establishing the allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses related to held to maturity securities for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was immaterial. The allowance for credit losses related to held to maturity securities was 19 thousand and 17 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There was no provision for credit losses recorded on available for sale investment securities for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 and no allowance for credit losses on available for sale investment securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Management is not aware of any potential problem loans or leases, trends or uncertainties, which it reasonably expects, will materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources which have not been disclosed. Additionally, management has disclosed all known material credits, which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment schedules. Other Income Other income consists of all revenues, which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets. Noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving United s profitability. Recognizing the importance, management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced. Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 31.94 million, a decrease of 1.72 million or 5.11 from the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was driven by net losses on the sale of investment securities and a decrease in mortgage banking income partially offset by increases in mortgage loan servicing income and fees from brokerage services. Noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 94.38 million, a decrease of 7.21 million or 7.09 from the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was driven by decreases in mortgage loan servicing income and mortgage banking income partially offset by an increase in fees from brokerage services, higher income from bank-owned life insurance and lower net losses on investment securities transactions. Income from mortgage banking activities totaled 4.54 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 7.56 million for the same period of 2023, a decline of 3.01 million or 39.86 . For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, income from mortgage banking activities was 13.74 million and 21.85 million, respectively. The decreases for 2024 as compared to 2023 were due mainly to lower mortgage loan production. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, mortgage loan sales were 171.32 million and 217.63 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, mortgage loan sales were 523.33 million and 632.85 million, respectively. Mortgage loans originated for sale were 151.33 million and 513.56 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 185.95 million and 635.58 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Mortgage loan servicing income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 6.54 million or 772.93 from the third quarter of 2023. This increase was driven primarily by the aforementioned 7.09 million gain on the sale of MSRs in the third quarter of 2024. Mortgage loan servicing income for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 4.01 million or 30.90 from the first nine months of 2023. The first nine months of 2024 also included the 7.09 million net gain on the sale of MSRs in the third quarter of 2024 while the first nine months of 2023 included net gains on the sale of MSRs of 8.31 million. In addition, mortgage loan servicing income declined in the first nine months of 2024 due to lower mortgage balances serviced since the sale of the MSRs in 2023.

United recorded a net loss on investment securities of 6.72 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a net loss on investment securities of 181 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, net losses on investment securities were 7.03 million as compared to net losses on investment securities of 7.92 million for the first nine months of 2023. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, United sold approximately 197 million and 299 million of AFS investment securities at a loss of 6.88 million and 13.69 million, respectively. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2024, United recognized a 6.91 million gain on the VISA share exchange, of which 4.60 million was realized through the sale of eligible shares and the remainder of which related to shares held at fair value at the end of the second quarter which were eventually sold in the third quarter of 2024. In the second quarter of 2023, United sold approximately 187 million of AFS investment securities resulting in a net loss of 7.24 million. Fees from brokerage services for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 640 thousand or 14.44 and 2.75 million or 21.89 , respectively, from the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher volume. Income from bank-owned life insurance for the first nine months of 2024 increased 1.52 million or 23.54 from the first nine months of 2023. This increase was due mainly to an increase in the cash surrender value of insurance policies as well as death proceeds of 690 thousand recognized in the third quarter of 2024. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased of 1.72 million, or 5.69 , from the second quarter of 2024 due mainly to the previously mentioned gain on the sale of MSRs and increased income from mortgage banking activities partially offset by an increase in net losses on investment securities transactions. Income from mortgage banking activities increased 643 thousand primarily due to higher mortgage loan sale volume and a higher quarter-end valuation of mortgage loans held for sale. Additionally, in comparison to the second quarter of 2024, an increase in mortgage loan servicing income was mostly offset by higher net losses on investment securities. Mortgage loan servicing income was 7.39 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 6.60 million from the second quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, as previously mentioned, United sold its remaining MSRs with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately 1.1 billion at a gain of 7.09 million. Net losses on investment securities were 6.72 million for the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to a net loss of 6.88 million on approximately 197 million of AFS investment securities sold in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net losses of 218 thousand for the second quarter of 2024. Other Expenses Just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced, it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations to reduce costs. Other expenses include all items of expense other than interest expense, the provision for credit losses, and income taxes. Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 135.34 million, which was relatively flat from the third quarter of 2023, increasing 109 thousand or less than 1 . For the first nine months of 2024, noninterest expense was 410.86 million, which was also relatively flat from the first nine months of 2023, increasing 2.92 million or less than 1 . Employee compensation for the first nine months of 2024 increased 3.30 million or 1.90 from the first nine months of 2023. The increase in employee compensation was driven by higher employee incentives, base salaries and employee severance related to the consolidation of the mortgage delivery channels. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in commissions related to lower mortgage banking production. Employee benefits expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased 1.31 million or 3.38 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher amounts of expense for postretirement benefits partially offset by lower health insurance costs.

OREO expense for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 636 thousand or 54.50 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to fewer declines in the fair value of OREO properties. Equipment expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 641 thousand or 8.94 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance expense partially offset by lower depreciation expense. Mortgage loan servicing expense and impairment expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 decreased 648 thousand or 61.66 and 2.21 million or 47.58 , respectively, from the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. The decreases in 2024 were due primarily to a lower amount of mortgage loans serviced as a result of the sale of MSRs in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. FDIC insurance expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased 2.10 million or 15.24 from the first nine months of 2023. The increase in FDIC insurance expense was driven by 1.81 million of expense recognized in the first quarter of 2024 for the FDIC special assessment. Other expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 1.08 million or 3.52 from the third quarter of 2023. This increase was driven by higher amounts of certain general operating expenses mostly offset by smaller decreases in several other categories of noninterest expense. Other expense for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 1.42 million or 1.48 from the first nine months of 2023. Within other expenses, the most significant decrease was 4.31 million in the expense for the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. In addition, advertising expense decreased 1.54 million and amortization of intangibles declined 1.11 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in the amortization of investment tax credits of 2.23 million and merger expenses of 1.61 million as well as higher amounts of certain other general operating expenses. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was relatively flat from the second quarter of 2024, increasing 565 thousand, or less than 1 . The slight increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven by increases in employee benefits of 937 thousand and other noninterest expense of 847 thousand. The increase in employee benefits was primarily driven by higher postretirement benefit costs. The increase in other noninterest expense from the second quarter of 2024 was driven by higher amounts of certain general operating expenses mostly offset by smaller decreases in several other categories of noninterest expense. Within other noninterest expense, merger-related expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 332 thousand compared to 1.27 million for the second quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting the increases in noninterest expense were decreases of 720 thousand in FDIC insurance expense due mainly to an adjustment for the special assessment in the second quarter of 2024 as well as a lower assessment rate and 608 thousand in mortgage loan servicing expense and impairment due to a lower amount of loans serviced. Income Taxes Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 was flat from the third quarter of 2023, decreasing 130 thousand, or less than 1 , primarily due to slightly lower pre-tax earnings partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate. On a linked-quarter basis, income tax expense increased 5.77 million from the second quarter of 2024. This increase was driven by higher pre-tax earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recognized in the second quarter of 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, income tax expense was 64.93 million as compared to 72.68 million in the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recognized in the second quarter of 2024. United s effective tax rate was 20.56 for the third quarter of 2024, 20.49 for the third quarter of 2023 and 16.36 for the second quarter of 2024. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, United s effective tax rate was 18.90 and 20.21 , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources In the opinion of management, United maintains liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and the credit needs of its customers. Like all banks, United depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets. A significant source of funds available to United is core deposits . Core deposits include certain demand deposits, statement and special savings and NOW accounts. These deposits are relatively stable, and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to United. Short-term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds. These include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as advances from the FHLB. Repurchase agreements represent funds which are obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process. Liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash. All banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near-cash items to meet the day-to-day demands of customers and United s cash needs. Other than cash and due from banks, the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity. The goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding which enables United to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet United s cash needs. Liquidity is managed by monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources. Substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents, unused short-term borrowing and a geographically dispersed network of branches providing access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market. Short-term needs can be met through a wide array of outside sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Other sources of liquidity available to United to provide long-term as well as short-term funding alternatives, in addition to FHLB advances, are long-term certificates of deposit, lines of credit, borrowings that are secured by bank premises or stock of United s subsidiaries and issuances of trust preferred securities. In the normal course of business, United through its Asset Liability Committee evaluates these as well as other alternative funding strategies that may be utilized to meet short-term and long-term funding needs. During the first nine months of 2024, United increased its interest-bearing deposit balance at the FRB by 330.04 million to 1.57 billion. The change in the balance at the FRB was mostly the result of a 1.01 billion increase in total deposits and 640.84 million of net sales, maturities, and paydowns in the available for sale debt securities portfolio partially offset by a 1.25 billion decrease in FHLB advances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash of 309.17 million was provided by operating activities due mainly to net income of 278.59 million. Net cash of 405.57 million was provided by investing activities which was primarily due to 661.41 million of net proceeds from the sales of investment securities over purchases partially offset by portfolio loan growth of 262.65 million. During the first nine months of 2024, net cash of 404.86 million was used in financing activities due primarily to a net repayment of 1.25 billion in FHLB advances and cash dividends paid of 150.54 million partially offset by growth in deposits of 1.01 billion. The net effect of the cash flow activities was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 309.89 million for the first nine months of 2024. At September 30, 2024, United had an unused borrowing amount at the FHLB of approximately 8.19 billion subject to delivery of collateral after certain trigger points, 4.03 billion without the delivery of additional collateral. United has various unused lines of credit available from certain of its correspondent banks in the aggregate amount of 280 million, all of which was available at September 30, 2024. United also has a 20 million unsecured, revolving line of credit with an unrelated financial institution to provide for general liquidity needs, all of which was available at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, United s borrowing capacity for the FRB Discount Window was 4.59 billion. United did not have any borrowings from the FRB s Discount Window, or its new Bank Term Funding Program, during the first nine months of 2024. United anticipates it can meet its obligations over the next 12 months and has no material commitments for capital expenditures. United also has lines of credit available. See Notes 10 and 11 to the accompanying unaudited Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the amounts available to United under lines of credit. The Asset Liability Committee monitors liquidity to ascertain that a liquidity position within certain prescribed parameters is maintained. No changes are anticipated in the policies of United s Asset Liability Committee.

United s capital position is financially sound. United seeks to maintain a proper relationship between capital and total assets to support growth and sustain earnings. United has historically generated attractive returns on shareholders equity. United is well-capitalized based upon regulatory guidelines. United s risk-based capital ratio is 16.18 at September 30, 2024 while its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and leverage ratios are 13.80 , 13.80 and 11.73 , respectively. The September 30, 2024 ratios reflects United s election of a five-year transition provision, allowed by the Federal Reserve Board and other federal banking agencies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to delay for two years the full impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized financial institution are a risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 , a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0 and a leverage ratio of 5.0 . Total shareholders equity was 4.97 billion at September 30, 2024, which was an increase of 196.58 million or 4.12 from December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 127.96 million in retained earnings (net income less dividends declared). United s equity to assets ratio was 16.64 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 15.94 at December 31, 2023. The primary capital ratio, capital and reserves to total assets and reserves, was 17.49 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 16.79 at December 31, 2023. United s average equity to average asset ratio was 16.64 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 16.12 the third quarter of 2023. United s average equity to average asset ratio was 16.52 for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 15.81 for the first nine months of 2023. All of these financial measurements reflect a financially sound position. During the third quarter of 2024, United s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.37 per share. Cash dividends were 1.11 per common share for the first nine months of 2024. Total cash dividends declared were 50.21 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 150.63 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 48.71 million for the third quarter of 2023 and 146.05 million for the first nine months of 2023, respectively. 

Item 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The objective of United s Asset Liability Management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within United s policy guidelines. This objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposures due to changes in economic conditions, interest rate levels and customer preferences. Interest Rate Risk Management considers interest rate risk to be United s most significant market risk. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in United s net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. United s earnings are largely dependent on the effective management of interest rate risk. Management of interest rate risk focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within Board-approved policy limits. United s Asset/Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Board, monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change to net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Policy established for interest rate risk is stated in terms of the change in net interest income over a one-year and two-year horizon given an immediate and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates. The current limits approved by the Board are structured on a staged basis with each stage requiring specific actions. United employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its exposure to changing interest rates. One such technique utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off-balance sheet instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities. The model also includes executive management projections for activity levels in product lines offered

by United. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model. Rate scenarios could involve parallel or nonparallel shifts in the yield curve, depending on historical, current, and expected conditions, as well as the need to capture any material effects of explicit or embedded options. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management s strategies. Interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time frame. The principal function of managing interest rate risk is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates. The difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the GAP. Earnings-simulation analysis captures not only the potential of these interest sensitive assets and liabilities to mature or reprice, but also the probability that they will do so. Moreover, earnings-simulation analysis considers the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time. United closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an on-going basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin. The following table shows United s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

Change in Interest Rates (basis points)

 At September 30, 2024, given an immediate, sustained 100 basis point upward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model, net interest income for United is estimated to increase by 1.82 over one year as compared to an increase by 0.24 at December 31, 2023. A 200 basis point immediate, sustained upward shock in the yield curve would increase net interest income by an estimated 2.82 over one year as of September 30, 2024, as compared to a decrease of 0.28 as of December 31, 2023. A 100 basis point immediate, sustained downward shock in the yield curve would increase net interest income by an estimated 0.22 over one year as of September 30, 2024 as compared to an increase of 2.66 , over one year as of December 31, 2023. A 200 basis point immediate, sustained downward shock in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated 0.14 over one year as of September 30, 2024 as compared to an increase of 4.35 over one year as of December 31, 2023. In addition to the one year earnings sensitivity analysis, a two-year analysis is also performed. Compared to the one year analysis, United is projected to show improved performance in year two within the upward rate shock scenarios. Given an immediate, sustained 100 basis point upward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model, net interest income for United is estimated to increase by 4.00 in year two as of September 30, 2024. A 200 basis point immediate, sustained upward shock in the yield curve would increase net interest income by an estimated 6.89 in year two as of September 30, 2024. A 100 basis point immediate, sustained downward shock in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated 2.29 in year two as of September 30, 2024. A 200 basis point immediate, sustained downward shock in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated 5.86 in year two as of September 30, 2024. While it is unlikely market rates would immediately move 100 or 200 basis points upward or downward on a sustained basis, this is another tool used by management and the Board to gauge interest rate risk. All of these estimated changes in net interest income are and were within the policy guidelines established by the Board. To further aid in interest rate management, United s subsidiary bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ). The use of FHLB advances provides United with a low risk means of matching maturities of earning assets and interest-bearing funds to achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets. In addition, United uses credit with large regional banks and trust preferred securities to provide funding.

As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, United may use derivative instruments to protect against adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities and on future cash flows. These derivatives commonly consist of interest rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, futures, forward contracts, written and purchased options. Interest rate swaps obligate two parties to exchange one or more payments generally calculated with reference to a fixed or variable rate of interest applied to the notional amount. United accounts for its derivative activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Extension Risk A key feature of most mortgage loans is the ability of the borrower to repay principal earlier than scheduled. This is called a prepayment. Prepayments arise primarily due to sale of the underlying property, refinancing, or foreclosure. In general, declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments, and rising interest rates tend to slow prepayments. Like other fixed-income securities, when interest rates rise, the value of mortgage-related securities generally declines. The rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of mortgage-related securities and may shorten or extend the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase. If interest rates rise, United s holdings of mortgage-related securities may experience reduced returns if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated. This is generally referred to as extension risk. At September 30, 2024, United s mortgage related securities portfolio had an amortized cost of 1.8 billion, of which approximately 925.9 million or 51 were fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs ). These fixed rate CMOs consisted primarily of planned amortization class PACs ), sequential-pay and accretion directed VADMs bonds having an average life of approximately 4.6 years and a weighted average yield of 2.84 , under current projected prepayment assumptions. These securities are expected to have moderate extension risk in a rising rate environment. Current models show that an immediate, sustained upward shock of 300 basis points, the average life of these securities would only extend to 6.4 years. The projected price decline of the fixed rate CMO portfolio in rates up 300 basis points would be 14.8 , or less than the price decline of a 7- year treasury note. By comparison, the price decline of a 30-year 5.5 current coupon mortgage backed security MBS in rates higher by 300 basis points would be approximately 18.9 . United had approximately 383.4 million in fixed rate Commercial mortgage backed Securities CMBS with a projected yield of 1.84 and a projected average life of 4.5 years on September 30, 2024. This portfolio consisted primarily of Freddie Mac Multifamily K securities and Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing DUS securities with a weighted average maturity WAM of 8.4 years. United had approximately 11.3 million in 15-year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of 2.05 and a projected average life of 4.1 years as of September 30, 2024. This portfolio consisted of seasoned 15-year mortgage paper with a weighted average loan age WALA of 5.5 years and a weighted average maturity WAM of 10.3 years. United had approximately 304.4 million in 20-year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of 1.81 and a projected average life of 6.1 years on September 30, 2024. This portfolio consisted of seasoned 20-year mortgage paper with a weighted average loan age WALA of 3.5 years and a weighted average maturity WAM of 16.3 years. United had approximately 151.8 million in 30-year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of 2.88 and a projected average life of 7 years on September 30, 2024. This portfolio consisted of seasoned 30-year mortgage paper with a weighted average loan age WALA of 4.6 years and a weighted average maturity WAM of 24.3 years. The remaining 1 of the mortgage related securities portfolio on September 30, 2024, included floating rate CMO, CMBS and mortgage backed securities.

Item 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision of and with the participation of United s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of United s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, United s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that United s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period required by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls United s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that United s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and fraud. While United s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Changes in Internal Controls There have been no changes in United s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 2024, or in other factors that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect United s internal control over financial reporting.
