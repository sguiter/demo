Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical
facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio
investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions and our assumptions. We are externally managed by the Adviser, a registered
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). Words such as anticipates, 
 expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, 
 believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, 
 targets, projects, potential, predicts, and variations of these words and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance
and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could
cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including: 

our
 future operating results; 

our business prospects and the
 prospects of our portfolio companies; 

risk associated with possible
 disruptions in our operations or the economy generally; 

changes in the general interest
 rate environment; 

general economic, political and
 industry trends and other external factors, including uncertainty surrounding the financial
 and political stability of the United States and other countries; 

our contractual arrangements
 and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts
 of interest with our Adviser and its affiliates; 

the dependence of our future
 success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we invest; 

the ability of our portfolio
 companies to achieve their objectives; 

the use of borrowed money to
 finance a portion of our investments; 

the adequacy of our financing
 sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash
 flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 

the ability of our Adviser to
 locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of our Adviser and
 its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to qualify and maintain
 our qualification as a BDC and as a regulated investment company RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code 

the impact on our business of
 U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 

the effect of changes in tax
 laws and regulations and interpretations thereof; and 

the risks, uncertainties and
 other factors we identify under Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in
 this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on
which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a
result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties,
the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation
by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which
may relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition and involves 

2 

numerous risks and uncertainties, including,
but not limited to, those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking
statements. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we make directly to you or through reports that we may file
with the SEC in the future, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

of expenses which are owed to the Adviser, and are included in Due to Adviser on the Consolidated
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In accordance with the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser has elected to pay the Company
for certain expenses incurred during the period from February 23, 2024 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2024. The
Adviser has elected to pay in expenses for the period from February 23, 2024 (commencement of operations) to September 30,
2024, of which remains receivable from the Adviser as of September 30, 2024. 

Management fee 

Prior to the Company s election to
be regulated as a BDC, the Company did not pay management fees. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred
no management fees. Following the BDC Election Date, the Company has begun to accrue management fees. 
The management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.00 of the value of the Company s net assets as of
the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable
month. For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, net assets mean the Company s total assets less liabilities determined on
a consolidated basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). 

Incentive Fees 

Prior to the Company s election to
be regulated as a BDC, the Company did not pay incentive fees. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred
no incentive fees. Following the BDC Election Date, the Company has begun to accrue incentive fees. 

The incentive fee will consist of two components
that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the
incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains, each as described
below. 

Incentive Fee Based on Income 

The portion based on our income is based
on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to our common shares. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
Returns means dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from
portfolio companies such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fee, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as
well as prepayments premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance and fees earned by the Adviser or an affiliate
accrued during the month, minus operating expenses for the month (including the management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under
the Advisory Agreement and an Administration Agreement with our Administrator, any expense of securitizations, and interest expense
or other financing fees and any dividends paid on preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee and shareholder servicing and/or
distribution fees, if any). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred
interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income
that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains,
realized capital losses, or unrealized gain/(loss). 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, adjusted for
any Share issuances or repurchases during the applicable quarter in which the Incentive Fee is calculated, is compared to a hurdle
rate of return of 1.50 per quarter (6.00 annualized). 

We will pay the Adviser an incentive fee
quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 

No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.50 per quarter (6.00 annualized); 

100 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.71 (6.84 annualized). We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.71 as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser

The significant unobservable input used in
yield analysis is the discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases/decreases in discount rates in isolation
would result in a significantly lower/higher fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the market approach
is the transaction price to acquire the position. There has been no change to the valuation based on the underlying assumptions
used at the closing of such transaction. There has been no change to the valuation based on the underlying assumptions used at
the closing of such transaction. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach
are the comparative yield or discount rate. The comparative yield and discount rate are used to discount the estimated future cash
flows, which include both future principal and interest payments expected to be received from the underlying investment. An increase/decrease
in the comparative yield or discount rate would result in a decrease/increase, respectively, in the fair value.

per annum, (ii) increased the available borrowing capacity of the facility

In connection with the Credit Facility, the

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts, per share data, percentages,
and as otherwise noted) 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Except as otherwise specified, references to we, us, our, or the
 Company refer to Lord Abbett Private Credit Fund. 

OVERVIEW 

We were formed on November 27, 2023, as a Delaware
limited partnership named Lord Abbett Private Credit Fund 1, LP. On August 30, 2024, we converted to a Delaware statutory trust
and were renamed Lord Abbett Private Credit Fund. We are a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected
to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are externally managed by the Adviser, which manages our day-to-day operations
and provides us with investment advisory services pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. The Adviser is registered as
an investment adviser with the SEC. We have also elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify
annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. 

The Adviser oversees (subject to the oversight
of the Board, a majority of whom are Independent Trustees) the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment
decisions with respect to our portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. Under the Advisory Agreement, we have
agreed to pay the Adviser an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Also, under
the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to pay Lord, Abbett Co. LLC (the Administrator an administration
fee on a monthly basis. 

Our investment objective is to generate current
income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation, by primarily focusing on directly originated, senior secured loans
to U.S. middle market companies. 

As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other
than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time
the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of our total assets. Qualifying assets are generally
privately offered securities issued by U.S. private companies or thinly traded public companies. We may also invest up to 30 of
our portfolio opportunistically in non-qualifying portfolio investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies,
joint ventures or other interests that are non-qualifying. The Adviser directly originates credit opportunities from a large universe
of Sponsors, strategic sourcing relationships, intermediaries and other direct lenders, as well as internal Lord Abbett resources. 

We generally intend to distribute substantially
all of our available earnings annually by paying distributions on a quarterly basis, as determined by our Board, in its discretion. 

KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Investments 

Our level of investment activity can and does
vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies,
the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 

Revenue 

We plan to generate revenue in the form of
interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies.
Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities
is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments
or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due
at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions.
Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as
interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will
be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 

Expenses 

Except as specifically provided below, all
investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to
us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services,
will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We will bear the following costs and expenses of our operations, 

23 

administration
and transactions, including, but not limited to (1) investment advisory fees, including the Base Management Fee and Incentive
Fee, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement; (2) Administration fee Administration Fee to the
Administrator, pursuant to the Administration Agreement; and (3) other expenses of the Company s operations and transactions
listed in Item 1. Business Expenses in our Form 10 filing. 

From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator
or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such
affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf that are Fund expenses. From time to time, the Adviser and the Administrator
may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by
our shareholders. 

The Company has entered into an Expense Support Agreement
with the Adviser. For additional information, see Note 3 - Related Party Transactions .

and for the period from February 23, 2024 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2024, net change in unrealized appreciation

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES 

We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings
of our common shares, net borrowings from our credit facilities and unsecured debt, and cash flows from interest and fees earned
from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments
through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of any closing
of our continuous private offering of our common shares. 

Our primary use of cash is investments in portfolio
companies, payments of our expenses, funding repurchases under our share repurchase program and payment of cash distributions to
our shareholders. Details of our credit facilities are described in Note 5 Debt to the consolidated
financial statements. We may also, from time to time, enter into new credit facilities, increase the size of existing credit facilities
or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity
requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Refer to Note 9 - Subsequent Events . 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES 

This discussion of our expected operating plans
is based upon our expected financial statements, which will be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements will require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining
such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we will describe our critical accounting
policies in the notes to our future financial statements. 

The Company is required to report its investments
for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with
Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act and ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes
the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of
valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market
for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Item 1. Business Determination of
Net Asset Value in our Form 10 for more information on how we value our investments. 

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

See Note 3 - Related Party
Transactions to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company s related party
transactions. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

We are subject to financial market risks, including
portfolio valuation risk, market risk and risk related to interest rates. 

Portfolio Valuation Risk 

The Adviser, subject to the oversight of the
Board, will determine the valuation of the Company s investments. It is expected that most of the Company s investments
will not have readily available market quotations, which will require the Adviser to estimate, in accordance with the Adviser s
valuation policies, the fair value of such investments on the valuation date. Fair value pricing is based on subjective judgments,
and it is possible that the fair value of a security may differ materially from the value that would be realized if the security
were sold. Absent bad faith or manifest error, valuation determinations of the Adviser will be conclusive and binding on the Company
investors. 

In addition, the Adviser may have an interest
in determining higher valuations in order to be able to present better performance to prospective investors. In certain cases,
the Company may hold an investment in an issuer experiencing distress or going through bankruptcy. In such a situation, the Adviser
may continue to place a favorable valuation on such investment due to the Adviser s determination that the investment is
sufficiently secured despite the distressed state or bankruptcy of the issuer. However, no assurances can be given that this assumption
is justified or that such valuations will be accurate in the long term. In addition, an investment in a portfolio company may not
be permanently written-off or permanently written down despite its distressed state or covenant breach until such portfolio company
experiences a material corporate event (e.g., bankruptcy or partial sale) which establishes an objective basis for such revised
valuation. In these circumstances, the Adviser has an interest in delaying any such write-offs or write-downs to maintain a higher
management fee base and thus, management fees paid to the Adviser. 

In addition, the Company may rely on third-party
valuation services to verify the value of certain investments. An investment may not have a readily ascertainable market value
and accordingly, could potentially make it difficult to determine a fair value of an investment and may yield an inaccurate valuation.
Further, because of the Adviser s knowledge of the investment, the valuation services may defer to the Adviser s valuation
even where such valuation may not be accurate or the determination thereof involved a conflict of interest. Additionally, the Company
may also choose to discontinue the use of any third-party valuation services at any time, which could create a conflict of interest
and impair the third-party valuation service s independence. An inaccurate valuation of an investment could have a substantial
impact on the Company. 

28 

Market Risk 

The success of the Company s activities
will be affected by general economic and market conditions, such as interest rates, inflation rates, industry conditions, competition,
technological developments, tax laws, availability of credit, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to
taxation of the Company s investments), trade barriers, currency exchange controls, and national and international political
circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations). These factors may affect, among other things, the level
and volatility of securities prices, the liquidity of the Company s investments and the availability of certain securities
and investments. Volatility or illiquidity could impair the Company s profitability or result in losses. The Company may
maintain substantial trading positions that can be materially adversely affected by the level of volatility in the financial markets the
larger the positions, the greater the potential for loss. Global markets have recently experienced unprecedented volatility and
losses. The effects thereof are continuing and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be materially adversely affected.
Furthermore, none of these conditions is within the control of the Adviser. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Adverse
Developments in the Debt Capital Markets of our Form 10. 

Risk Related to Interest Rates 

Interest rates are highly sensitive to many
factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and
other factors beyond the ability of the Company to control or to forecast. Debt securities have varying levels of sensitivity to
changes in interest rates. When the Company chooses to borrow money to make investments, the Company s net investment income
will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which the Company borrows funds and the rate at which the Company
invest those funds. As a result, the Company can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates would not
have a material adverse effect on its net investment income in the event the Company uses debt to finance its investments. In periods
of rising interest rates, the Company s cost of funds would increase, which could reduce its net investment income. The Company
may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. In addition,
a rise in the general level of interest rates typically leads to higher interest rates applicable to the Company s debt investments. 

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 100.0 
of our debt investments were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of September 30,
2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical reference rate changes in interest rates (considering
interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate debt instruments assuming no changes in our investments and borrowing structure
as of September 30, 2024):

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) have concluded that
our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company
that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. 

See also Note 1 - Organization 
of this Form 10-Q. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set
forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A of our Form 10, which could
