. Campbell Company s attempt to manage the risk of the Trust s open positions is essentially
 the same in all market categories traded. Campbell Company applies risk management policies to its trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be taken per risk unit of assets under management. In addition, Campbell
 Company follows diversification guidelines (often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups), as well as reducing position sizes dynamically in response to trading losses. Campbell 
 Company controls the risk of the Trust s non-trading fixed income instruments by limiting the duration of such instruments and requiring a minimum credit quality of the issuers of those instruments.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Introduction

The Campbell Fund Trust (the Trust is a business trust organized on January 2, 1996 under the Delaware Business Trust Act, which was replaced by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act as of September 1,
 2002. The Trust is a successor to the Campbell Fund Limited Partnership (formerly known as the Commodity Trend Fund) which began trading operations in January 1972. The Trust currently trades in the U.S. and international futures, forward and
 centrally cleared swap markets under the sole direction of Campbell Company, LP, the managing operator of the Trust. Specifically, the Trust trades in a diverse array of global assets, including global interest rates, stock indices, currencies,
 credit and commodities. The Trust is an actively managed account with speculative trading profits as its objective.

Effective August 31, 2008, the Trust began offering Series A, Series B, and Series W Units. The units in the Trust prior to that date became Series B Units. Series B Units are only available for
 additional investment by existing holders of Series B Units. Effective August 1, 2017, the Trust began offering Series D units.

As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate capitalization of the Trust was 552,271,435 with Series A, Series B, Series D and Series W comprising 414,665,915, 40,815,025, 37,223,920 and 59,566,575,
 respectively, of the total. The Net Asset Value per Unit was 4,297.55 for Series A, 4,772.48 for Series B, 1,750.52 for Series D and 5,424.03 for Series W.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
 reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates utilized
 in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the Financial Statements.

The Trust records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized and change in unrealized trading gain (loss) in the Statements
 of Operations. Generally, fair values are based on market prices; however, in certain circumstances, estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price (i.e., forward contracts which are traded in the
 inter-bank market).

Capital Resources

The Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering, and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the
 Trust s business, it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets which are not operating capital or assets.

The Trust generally maintains 60 to 75 of its net asset value in cash, cash equivalents or other liquid positions in its cash management program over and above that needed to post as collateral for
 trading. These funds are available to meet redemptions each month. After redemptions and additions are taken into account each month, the trade levels of the Trust are adjusted and positions in the instruments the Trust trades are added or liquidated
 on a pro-rata basis to meet those increases or decreases in trade levels.

Liquidity

Most United States futures exchanges limit fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits. During a single
 trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has reached the daily limit for that day, positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated. Futures prices have occasionally
 moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent the Trust from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the Trust to substantial losses which could exceed the margin
 initially committed to such trades. In addition, even if futures prices have not moved the daily limit, the Trust may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices, if little trading in such contracts is taking place. Other than these
 limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in the Trust s futures trading operations, the Trust s assets are expected to be highly liquid.

Table of Contents 

The entire offering proceeds, without deductions, will be credited to the Trust s bank, custodial and/or cash management accounts. The Trust meets margin requirements for its trading activities by
 depositing cash and U.S. government securities with the futures broker and the over-the-counter counterparty. This does not reduce the risk of loss from trading futures, forward and swap contracts. The Trust receives all interest earned on its
 assets. No other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of Trust assets.

Approximately 15 to 40 of the Trust s assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures brokers, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such
 assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury Bills in segregated accounts with the futures brokers pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder. Approximately 5 to 15 of the Trust s assets are deposited with the
 over-the-counter counterparty or centrally cleared in order to initiate and maintain forward contracts. Such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, unless such over-the-counter counterparty is
 registered as a futures commission merchant. These assets are held either in U.S. government securities or short-term time deposits with U.S.-regulated bank affiliates of the over-the-counter counterparty.

The managing operator deposits the majority of those assets of the Trust that are not required to be deposited as margin with the futures brokers and over-the-counter counterparties in a custodial
 account with Northern Trust Company. The assets deposited in the custodial account with Northern Trust Company are segregated. Such custodial account constitutes approximately 60 to 75 of the Trust s assets and are invested directly by PNC Capital
 Advisors, LLC PNC ). PNC is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. PNC does not guarantee any interest or profits will accrue on the Trust s assets in the custodial account. PNC invest the assets
 according to agreed upon investment guidelines that first preserve capital, second allow for sufficient liquidity, and third provide a yield beyond the risk-free rate. Investments can include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. Government Securities,
 Government Agency Securities, Municipal Securities, banker acceptances and certificates of deposits; (ii) commercial paper; (iii) short-term investment grade corporate debt; and (iv) Asset Backed Securities.

The Trust occasionally receives margin calls (requests to post more collateral) from its futures brokers or over-the-counter counterparty, which are met by moving the required portion of the assets held
 in the custody account at Northern Trust Company to the margin accounts. In the past three years, the Trust has not needed to liquidate any position as a result of a margin call.

The Trust s assets are not and will not be, directly or indirectly, commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested in or loaned to Campbell Company or any
 affiliated entities.

Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The term off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Trust trades in
 futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Trust, market risk, that such contracts may
 be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Trust at the same time, and if the
 Trust s trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the Trust, the Trust could lose all of its assets and the Unitholders would realize a 100 loss. Campbell Company, the managing operator (who also acts as trading
 advisor), minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 40 however, these precautions may not be effective in limiting the risk
 of loss.

In addition to market risk, in entering into futures, forward and swap contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Trust. The counterparty for
 futures contracts and centrally cleared swap contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse
 who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some
 foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.

In the case of forward contracts, which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of
 financial institutions; thus there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. Campbell Company trades for the Trust only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of the Trust are valued each day at fair
 value. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Trust.

Disclosures About Certain Trading Activities that Include Non-Exchange Traded Contracts Accounted for at Fair Value

The Trust invests in futures, forward currency, and centrally cleared swap contracts. The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and reflects
 the settlement price for each contract as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.)
 of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of centrally cleared swap contracts is determined by using currency market quotations provided by an independent external pricing source.

The Trust realized a profit in January. Gains came from equity index and interest rates holdings, while trading in foreign exchange (FX), commodities, and credit produced partially offsetting losses
 during the month. Global stock indexes generated profits for the Trust. Net long positioning on a variety of equity indices benefitted as most major global stock indexes finished the month in positive territory. The general risk-on sentiment was
 fueled by goldilocks data releases, ongoing disinflationary traction, some positive earnings takeaways, and Chinese stimulus measures. Fixed income markets contributed additional gains during the month. January s overarching theme was the unwinding
 of expectations for early rate cuts across the world. In the US, bond prices fell (yields rose) as solid economic data cast doubts on how quickly the Fed will begin cutting rates, benefiting short positioning in US 30yr Treasuries. Additional gains
 were realized in payer positions (which benefit from higher rates) in Scandinavian instruments. Hotter-than-expected Swedish inflation spurred traders to look for less easing by the Riksbank, while a moderately hawkish tilt by Norges Bank took
 Norwegian yields higher. In the credit indices, partially offsetting losses were realized in short protection positions as most credit spreads widened. FX trading generated partially offsetting losses with short positions in the developed market
 currencies (versus long USD) suffering the most. The dominant theme was the aforementioned improving data out of the US, which caused a correction in the USD after the dovish Fed expectations in the prior months. Gains in short NOK (versus long the
 USD) were more than offset by losses in long positions in markets like NZD. Commodity trading also provided losses for the Trust. Energies were the worst performing commodity sub-sector with most energy markets posting negative returns. A short
 holding in natural gas, one of the big winners for the Trust in 2023, faltered as models covered much of their position during a rally in the first half of the month, consequently missing much of the move lower in the latter half of the month. Short
 grain holdings provided some offsetting gains, as the agricultural complex weakened on expectations for widening inventories and weaker demand.

The Trust produced a gain in February. Gains came from equity index, interest rates, and credit holdings, while trading in foreign exchange (FX) and commodities produced some partially offsetting losses
 during the month. Long global stock index positioning generated the best sector returns for the Trust. Many equity markets around the globe were bolstered to all-time highs amid the artificial-intelligence euphoria as well as stronger US economic
 data. Concentration concerns, stretched positioning, and a hawkish Fed remain the key overhangs. Fixed income markets contributed additional gains during the month. Global bond prices fell (yields rose) as expectations for imminent rate cuts
 continued to fade, with central bank officials pushing back on early spring cuts. Short positioning in German 5yr and 10yr bonds benefited after the ECB minutes confirmed that policymakers still believe it is too soon to cut rates, prompting traders
 to reduce rate cut bets to 

The Trust produced a gain in March. Gains came from equity index, foreign exchange (FX), credit, and commodity holdings, while trading interest rates produced some partially offsetting losses during the
 month. Global stock indexes generated the best profits for the Trust. Net long positioning on a variety of equity indices benefitted as equities posted another month of gains as the US economy remained resilient, the Fed signaled it is still willing
 to cut interest rates this year, and AI optimism continued to be a key tailwind for the market. Foreign exchange trading experienced additional gains for the Trust in March. Long positions on the US dollar benefited as the USD strengthened on back of
 rate differential expectations. That is, the market is still pricing in the Fed to cut rates this year, but not as early as other central banks. The Scandinavian central banks were particularly dovish in March and their currencies weakened; a short
 position on the Norwegian krone (versus long the USD) was a standout performer for the Trust. Short protection positions on the credit indices generated additional gains as spreads narrowed on the month amid the broader rally in risk assets.
 Commodity trading was modestly additive in March. Positive performance came from nearly all markets in the energy sub-sector, as efforts from OPEC+ to curb supply and continued geopolitical risks in the Middle East were favorable to net long
 holdings. Underperformance in short grain positioning capped sector gains. Fixed income markets contributed offsetting losses during the month. Global bonds rallied (yields fell) as many of the major central banks turned more dovish after two months
 of pushing back against rate cuts. The BOE delivered a more dovish split to its voting pattern and UK gilts advanced, generating losses on short positioning. In the wake of dovish-leaning ECB meetings/commentary, short positioning on German bonds
 incurred additional losses. Meanwhile, guidance from the Czech National Bank was an exception on the month and delivered a hawkish bias. Receiver positions in Czech Interest Rate Swaps (lower rates desired) suffered losses as a result.

The Trust produced a gain in April. Gains came from interest rates trading while, equity index, foreign exchange (FX), credit, and commodity holdings produced some partially offsetting losses during the
 month. Fixed income markets generated the best sector returns for the Trust. April saw bonds swing between the competing narratives of persistent inflation prompting calls for yields to be higher for longer and geopolitical risks prompting safe
 haven bids. Ultimately, the former prevailed which pushed global bond prices lower (yields higher). Short positioning in US Treasuries across all tenors profited after the hot US CPI caused a hawkish repricing of the Fed s policy outlook. By month
 end, traders had pushed back the timing of the first rate cut to December, dramatically changing the base case for 2024 from six cuts to a single year-end cut. The sell-off in Treasuries spilled over into global markets, to the benefit of short
 positioning in German bonds. In IRS markets, payer positions (desires rates higher) in Norway and Sweden added to gains as rates in Scandinavian countries rose in tandem with the US. Largely long positioning in global equity indices had a negative
 impact on Trust performance for the month with risk markets facing a reckoning of the likelihood of higher for longer yields in conjunction with heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In the credit indices, additional losses were
 realized in short protection positions as credit spreads widened amid the broader move lower in risk. FX trading generated additional losses during the month with the Developed Market (DM) currencies suffering the most. While the USD index continued
 its strengthening trend on back of the aforementioned stronger US CPI and fewer 2024 rate cuts expected from the Fed, certain DM currency pairs traded in a more choppy fashion. Gains in short NOK (versus long the USD) were more than offset by Trust
 losses in currencies like the AUD and GBP, which suffered amid the mid-month reversals. Commodity holdings detracted modestly from P L in April. The energy sub-sector produced small losses, with a short natural gas position the underperformer as
 natural gas futures rallied into month-end amid forecasts for warming temps for much of the US. Grains and industrial metals holdings produced some partially offsetting gains.

The Trust produced a loss during May. Losses came from foreign exchange (FX), commodity, and interest rate positions, while stocks and credit index trading created some partially offsetting gains. FX
 trading generated Trust losses during the month with the Developed Market currencies suffering the worst. May proved to be a difficult month for some FX strategies to navigate given the abrupt shift in the trend of the US dollar. After four straight
 months of gains for the USD index, the greenback slipped in May on back of several goldilocks economic data points. While our models reacted quickly in certain markets like the GBP and benefited from the strength in the pound, they were more than
 offset by short positions in the NOK and EUR. Commodity positions also detracted from the Trust during the month. The dominant losses were found in the energy sub-sector, led by a short natural gas holding. Futures prices in natural gas rose as
 tightening supplies spurred a rally. Short grain holdings produced additional losses as the grain complex rallied amid crop concerns. Precious metals produced some offsetting gains as silver prices rose to the highest in more than a decade. Fixed
 income instruments generated additional losses. Global bonds ended the month mixed with US Treasuries outperforming their peers. The aforementioned goldilocks US data put Fed rate cuts back in play, sending 10yr and 5yr Treasuries higher (yields
 lower) to the detriment of short positioning. Conversely, rate cut speculation in mainland Europe was dialed back on signs of persistent services sector inflation and elevated wage growth, creating losses in long positioning in short-dated Eurozone
 bonds. A strong GDP print coupled with a small upside inflation surprise in Switzerland pushed rates higher, hurting receiver (desire rates lower) Swiss IRS positioning. Long positioning in global equity indices provided some partially offsetting
 gains for the Trust in May. Stock markets advanced on the back of renewed traction surrounding the soft-landing narrative and on optimism for the Fed to begin cutting rates later this year. In the credit indices, additional gains were realized in
 short protection positions as credit spreads tightened amid the broader move higher in risk.

The Trust produced a gain during June. Profits came from commodity and stock index holdings, while interest rate, foreign exchange (FX), and credit positions created some partially offsetting losses.
 Commodity holdings produced the best Trust profits during June. The dominant gains were found from short positioning in the grain markets. The grain complex weakened on ample supplies and sluggish demand with prices plunging into month-end after the
 USDA acreage report showed higher-than-expected plantings. Holdings in meats, softs, and energies produced additional gains. Stocks trading was also additive for the Trust in June. Long Asian and US stock positions proved beneficial as indexes in
 those regions advanced on AI enthusiasm as well as soft landing optimism after the US CPI and PPI figures added to the disinflation narrative. Meanwhile, long holdings on European indices produced some offsetting losses as those markets weakened on
 the back of political uncertainty. Fixed income instruments generated partially offsetting losses for the Trust in June, dominated by short positioning in long-dated bonds. Prices rallied (yields fell) as the first of the G-7 central banks began to
 cut rates. German 10-year bonds headlined losses after the ECB cut 25bps, its first move lower since 2016. While the US Fed held rates unchanged, short positioning in US 10-year Treasuries added to losses after a soft inflation print cleared the path
 for future Fed interest rate cuts. In the credit indices, additional losses were realized in short protection positions. Credit spreads widened on the month, dominated by Europe and political uncertainty after the EU elections. FX trading provided
 additional losses during the month with the Developed Market currencies suffering the worst. The US dollar may have strengthened on the month, but it wasn t a smooth ride given the mixed economic data. The hotter US employment report early in June
 caused a sharp move higher in the USD only to revert lower with the softer US CPI report one week later. The USD eventually made new monthly highs with global election concerns helping the flight-to-quality move, but the choppiness proved difficult
 for certain strategies.

The Trust produced a gain during July. Profits came from all traded asset classes; stock index, foreign exchange (FX), interest rate markets, credit, and commodities all benefited the Trust. Long
 positioning in equity indices produced the best gains for the Trust in July amid a broader pickup in volatility. US equities posted strong gains to start the month as cooling economic data helped to fuel soft-landing expectations and rate cut bets.
 Though there was a large rotation out of tech mega-cap names and into value/cyclical/small-cap shares, the P L gains realized in the first half of the month more than offset the rotation-driven losses. Foreign exchange trading generated
 additional profits with gains in Developed Market currencies dominating the sector. FX markets experienced some volatility-driving events during the month, and there were some notable divergences across countries. The Japanese yen strengthened
 sharply on back of a more hawkish approach from the Bank of Japan, carry trades were unwound, and commodity currencies were sold. While the choppiness in AUDUSD was a pain-point for the Trust the month prior, the Australian dollar trended lower in
 the second half of July, benefiting the Trust. Fixed income instruments provided further gains as easing cycles from some countries pushed yields lower. Canadian bonds rallied (yields fell) after the Bank of Canada cut rates for a second straight
 meeting, benefiting a long CGB position. A receiver Czech IRS position (desire lower yields) added to gains after a weaker-than-expected CPI print boosted the scope for further monetary easing. Long positioning in short-term European bonds benefited
 after the ECB held interest rates steady and signaled the September meeting will be wide open. In the credit indices, additional gains were experienced in short protection positions as credit spreads tightened over the month. Commodity holdings
 produced additional Trust profits during the month. The dominant gains were found in short grain positioning as ample crops from the US amid a lack of Chinese demand sent the agricultural complex lower. Long oil holdings led to some partially
 offsetting P L losses as petroleum markets weakened on the back of the aforementioned weaker expectations of China s commodity consumption.

The Trust produced a loss during August. Losses came from stock indices, commodities, and credit holdings. Fixed income markets provided partially offsetting gains while foreign exchange (FX) positions
 had minimal impact. Long positioning on global stock indexes generated Trust losses. Equity markets started the month severely under pressure after a more hawkish-than-expected Bank of Japan meeting. Japanese stocks saw their worst single day of
 losses since 1987 with the volatility bleeding into other risk assets. A dramatic miss from US employment figures further contributed to the downturn in sentiment as market appetite turned towards the need for drastic rate cuts from the Federal
 Reserve. Though equity markets experienced a significant bounce into month-end, losses realized in the first few days of August were unable to be fully recovered. Commodities also detracted from P L in August. Energies generated the largest
 sub-sector losses during the month, led by long positioning across Brent and WTI crude oil, as prices fell alongside global equities at the start of the month. A long cocoa holding provided some partially offsetting gains as cocoa futures advanced on
 West African supply concerns. Fixed income instruments generated gains during the month. Global bonds rallied (yields fell) as most major central banks turned decisively more dovish. Long positioning in US 5Y and 10Y Treasuries led gains with the
 weaker US data triggering a reassessment of the Fed outlook. Canadian 10Y bonds advanced on the back of a mixed jobs report and softer inflation, to the benefit of long positioning. Short Japanese 10Y positioning delivered partially offsetting losses
 as Japanese bond prices followed peers higher despite the Bank of Japan bucking the broader easing trend. In the credit indices, mixed positioning and a choppy month of price action led to losses. FX trading had minimal impact on P L with gains
 in Developed Market currencies offsetting the losses experienced in the Emerging Markets. While Trust positioning was mixed, the dominant theme was US dollar weakness with Fed Chair Powell saying the time has come for policy to adjust which led
 markets to price in a cut for September.

The Trust produced a gain in September. Profits during the month came from interest rate, foreign exchange (FX), stock index, and credit holdings. Commodities had a more muted impact on P L. Fixed
 income instruments generated gains during the month. Global bond prices rallied (yields fell) as increasing bets the Fed would start its easing cycle with a 50bp cut became a reality. Long positioning in short-dated instruments profited as the
 jumbo-sized cut by the Fed was accentuated at the more interest-rate sensitive portion of the curve. Longs on Canadian 10yr bonds produced gains after the BOC shaved 25bps off their benchmark rate for the third consecutive month amid weakening
 inflation data. Receiver Sweden and Czech IRS positions (desire lower rates) also profited as their respective policy makers cut rates amid weaker growth and receding inflation. FX trading also had a positive impact on P L with gains coming from
 long positions in both the Developed and Emerging Market currencies (versus short the USD). Softer US inflation and slower growth from the labor market was the catalyst for the weaker dollar and the expectations for the larger cut from the Federal
 Reserve. Other central banks around the world did not have as much of a dovish surprise as the Fed during the month, so US policy and the dollar were the biggest impetus for shifts in FX positioning. Long stock index positioning provided additional
 gains for the Trust in September. Most global stock indices rallied during the month after the jumbo 50bps Fed rate cut propelled stocks to new all-time highs. Continued AI optimism and more aggressive-than-expected Chinese stimulus further supported
 equities globally. In the credit indices, short protection positions benefited with the major credit spreads tightening on the month. Commodity holdings had minimal P L impact on the month. The meat sub-sector was profitable for the Trust, led by
 a long live cattle position. Cattle futures rallied during the month amid an increase in beef demand expectations. Soft commodities provided additional gains for the Trust, while short grain complex positions generated some partially offsetting
 losses.

The Trust showed a profit in January. Gains came from stock index, commodity, foreign exchange (FX), and credit positions, while interest rate holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Global
 stock indexes generated the largest gains for the Trust in January. Net long positioning on a variety of equity holdings gained as most major global stock indexes finished the month in the green. The general risk-on sentiment was fueled by China
 reopening optimism and the hopes that the world s Central Banks ease off their aggressive rate-hike cycle. A slew of mixed Q4 earnings reports and continued layoff announcements were largely ignored as money flowed into riskier assets. Commodity
 trading also provided gains for the Trust to start the year. Long coffee and sugar holdings generated the biggest wins within the softs sub-sector as those prices rallied on supply concerns. Industrial metals generated additional gains for the Trust
 spearheaded by a long LME copper position. The base metals complex experienced a significant monthly rally on back of the weak US dollar, ongoing China reopening optimism, and increasing concern over dwindling stockpiles. Foreign exchange trading
 produced additional Trust profits. The US dollar experienced a sell-off in January and the gains on long Emerging Market (EM) positions, versus short the USD, more than offset the losses incurred in the short Developed Market (DM) currencies. Longs
 in Latin American currencies were the main EM gainers as risky assets and carry trades were bought in the risk-on environment. Interest rate positions generated partially offsetting losses on the month. US Treasuries advanced (yields fell) after
 easing US inflation data strengthened the case for the Fed to turn less aggressive, hurting short positioning along the curve. In Europe, short positioning on German bonds added to Trust losses as prices followed Treasuries higher despite hawkish
 rhetoric from Lagarde and other European Central Bankers. Long positioning on UK gilts and the Aussie 10-year bond generated partially offsetting gains.Short protection positions in the credit indices which narrowed sharply alongside the broader
 rally in risk assets generated gains for the Trust.

The Trust showed a robust profit in February. Gains came from fixed income, foreign exchange (FX), and commodity positions, while stock indices produced some partially offsetting losses. Credit holdings
 had limited P L impact on the month. Interest rate positions dominated Trust gains in February with long-dated and short-dated instruments equally contributing to profits. US Treasury prices fell (yields rose) as hotter-than-expected inflation
 data and an extraordinary jump in payrolls elicited increasingly hawkish commentary from Fed members throughout the month, benefiting short positioning. Euro-area core inflation accelerated to a record, prompting money markets to price in a higher
 ECB terminal rate, which created gains for short German bond positioning. Interest rate swap holdings were also additive, led by a payer position in Mexican rates as yields moved higher after a larger-than-expected rate hike from Mexico s Central
 Bank. Foreign exchange trading produced additional Trust returns. The US dollar rallied over the course of the month and the Trust s short positions in the Developed Market (DM), versus long the US dollar, drove sector gains. A short Norwegian krone
 holding (against long USD) was a major P L contributor in the FX sector as the krone continued to be susceptible to weakness in energies, ultimately ending the month as the worst performing G-10 currency in 2023. Commodities provided additional
 profits for the Trust in February. Short holdings across the industrial and precious metal sub-sectors profited as increasing expectations for further Fed policy tightening and a stronger US dollar weighed on metals prices. Net long global stock
 index positioning generated some offsetting losses during the month. After a strong start to the year, February saw equity markets retrace in North America and Asia. In the US, stronger-than-expected economic releases, which included labor and
 inflation data, spurred a meaningful repricing of FOMC rate expectations. In the APAC region, strained US-China geopolitical relations and weaker near-term demand outlooks for China further weighed on risk sentiment. Long positioning on European
 equities provided some offsetting gains as markets proved more resilient to higher rates in the region.

The Trust realized a loss in March. Losses came from interest rate, stock, commodity, and credit holdings, while foreign exchange (FX) produced some partially offsetting gains during the month. Interest
 rate positions dominated Trust losses on the month, with both long-dated and short-dated instruments suffering in the wake of the banking crisis that drove global bond prices higher (yields lower). The negative impact on the financial sector from the
 US Fed s policy tightening campaign prompted traders to scale back rate hike bets, hurting short US Treasury positioning across most tenors. Partially offsetting gains came from long UK Gilt and Aussie 10-year bond positioning, both of which
 benefited from the rapid shift to less risky assets. Stock holdings also weighed on Trust performance amid a volatile month of trading. Predominantly long stock positioning was negatively impacted after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the
 ensuing fears of contagion. Some stock P L losses were recovered with prices rallying off mid-month lows as the banking sector stabilized and investors weighed the possibility of the Fed pausing its rate increases. Commodity positions added to
 Trust losses in March. Short precious metal holdings generated the largest sub-sector losses as bullion prices rose amid the banking sector turmoil, diminished expectations for further Fed tightening, and a softer US dollar. Credit trading generated
 additional losses as a short protection position in the iTraxx Senior Financial index suffered after credit spreads widened sharply in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse fiascos. Foreign exchange trading provided some partially
 offsetting Trust gains. While the DXY index traded lower during the month on back of the shift to a more dovish outlook on the US Federal Reserve, a few of the so-called commodity currencies were the exceptions. The Trust profited from
 short-positions on the Aussie dollar and Norwegian krone, which both traded softer on back of weakness in oil markets.

The Trust was close to unchanged in April. Commodity and foreign exchange (FX) positions produced gains, while fixed income holdings generated offsetting losses. Credit and stock holdings had little
 effect on the Trust. The commodity sector was additive for the Trust during the month. A long sugar holding produced a significant gain as the soft commodity rallied to an 11-year high on Brazilian supply concerns following above-average rainfall in
 the region. Some long energy holdings generated partially offsetting losses amid a mid-month sector-wide selloff that was spurred by recession worries and potentially tighter financial conditions which clouded the outlook for fuel demand. FX trading
 contributed modest gains in April. Varied performance in the global FX markets (versus the dollar), coupled with mixed positioning led to negligible sector P L. Short positions on the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar, which continued their
 2023 weakening trends, resulted in gains for the Trust. Partially offsetting losses were realized in certain emerging market currencies, where long positioning was a detractor in the risk-off environment. Mixed credit positions produced de minimis
 gains for the Trust as credit spreads widened alongside the sell-off in other risky assets. Interest rate positions added modest losses to the Trust over the month. UK Gilts underperformed after data showed inflation remained in the double digits,
 prompting traders to raise bets on the peak BOE rate, hurting long positioning. Aussie bonds also contributed to losses after minutes showed the RBA discussed a quarter-point hike before deciding on a pause in April. Short US Treasury positions
 generated some partially offsetting gains. Stocks indexes trading was flat for the Trust in April. Gains were seen from Asian and European stock holdings while US index positions generated offsetting losses as markets weighed the potential
 higher-for-longer dynamic, the debt ceiling stalemate, renewed banking sector turmoil, and a pickup in growth worries with better than feared earnings and guidance.

The Trust produced a gain during May. Profits came from commodity and foreign exchange (FX) positions, while stock index and interest rates produced some partially offsetting losses. Credit holdings had
 little impact on the Trust. The commodity sector led Trust gains during the month of May. Short copper positions generated the best sector gains with prices falling to 6-month lows as sentiment soured on the back of China s disappointing economic
 recovery and on the stronger US dollar. Additionally, copper stockpiles rebounded from multi-year lows. A short natural gas position also provided gains as the energy dropped amid ample supplies following persistent milder weather in the US. Foreign
 exchange trading generated additional Trust profits. Despite debt-ceiling concerns in the United States, the US dollar rallied during the month and the Trust s gains on short Developed Market (DM) positions (versus long the USD) marginally offset the
 losses incurred in some long Emerging Market (EM) currencies. Shorts in commodity-linked currencies like the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar were the big DM gainers with those FX markets depreciating as oil prices sold off and as China growth
 concerns increased. Global stock index trading resulted in losses to the Trust. Net-long positioning for much of the month generated losses as recession fears, a higher-for-longer stance from many Central Banks, US debt ceiling concerns, and
 China s lackluster recovery weighed on sentiment. A strong AI-driven rally following Nvidia s upbeat earnings and blow-out guidance at month-end capped losses. Interest rate positions were also a negative contributor in May. Long positioning on the
 UK Gilt led losses as a higher-than-expected UK inflation print put pressure on the Bank of England to continue hiking and caused Gilts to weaken (yields higher). Partially offsetting gains came from Canadian and New Zealand interest rate
 instruments. Canada s inflation also came in hotter-than-expected which proved beneficial to short CGB positioning as prices declined. Payer NZD IRS positioning (which is profitable with higher yields) experienced monthly gains as Kiwi yields pushed
 higher prior to the late May RBNZ meeting.

The Trust produced a loss in June. Losses came from commodity and foreign exchange holdings while interest rate, stock index, and credit positions produced some partially offsetting gains during the
 month. The commodity sector led Trust losses during the month of June. Energy positions generated the largest sub-sector loss, namely from a short natural gas holding. Futures on natural gas rallied throughout the month as warmer temperatures
 continued to drive up cooling demand. A short on cocoa futures added to monthly losses as the soft commodity surged on fears heavy rains in major producing countries will disrupt harvests. Foreign exchange trading generated additional Trust losses as
 short positions in the Developed Market currencies (versus long the USD) more than offset the gains experienced in the Emerging Markets. The dominant story for the USD and monetary policy was that the Fed skipped a rate hike at its June meeting
 while other central banks like the ECB remained focused on tightening. This divergence resulted in the dollar index trading weaker on the month, hurting our net long USD position. Interest rate positions resulted in some offsetting gains in June with
 the positive P L being led by short-dated instruments. With the exception of the Federal Reserve, major central banks continued raising rates with several delivering larger-than-expected hikes against a backdrop of better-than-expected economic
 data and persistent inflation. Short positioning on Euribor and German 2-year bonds benefited as yields rallied (prices fell) in the wake of a 25bps ECB hike and ongoing hawkish commentary from ECB President Lagarde. Short protection positions on the
 credit indices generated additional gains for the Trust. Credit spreads narrowed amid the broader rally in risk and the Trust benefited as a result. Global stock indexes generated profits for the Trust. Net long positioning on a variety of equity
 holdings benefited as most major indices finished the month in positive territory. Despite aggressive monetary policy tightening and geopolitical tensions, risk-on sentiment prevailed on optimistic soft-landing expectations and AI sector growth
 tailwinds.

The Trust produced a loss in July. Losses came from foreign exchange (FX) and interest rate holdings while credit and commodity positions produced some partially
 offsetting gains during the month. Stock indexes had little impact. Foreign exchange trading generated Trust losses with short positions in the Developed Market currencies (versus long USD) dominating FX P L. The main story around US policy was
 that while the Fed hiked 25bps in July, the market is pricing in a terminal rate that is close to its peak, which caused weakness in the greenback relative to its peers. The biggest Trust loss came from a short on the Norwegian krone, which saw
 additional appreciation on back of the continued strength in crude prices. Interest rate positions were also a negative contributor in July. Mixed fixed income positions generated losses as yields traded choppy as the markets weighed cooling
 inflation trends, peak Fed expectations, sticky employment, and strong economic data. Offsetting gains were experienced in a payer position on the NOK as yields continued their move higher with Norway s economy seen as more resilient than
 neighboring Sweden. Short protection positions on the credit indices generated partially offsetting gains for the Trust. Credit spreads narrowed amid the broader rally in risk and the Trust benefited as a result. The commodity sector added further
 gains for the Trust in July. Long energy positions were the largest sector contributor as the complex rallied amid signs of tightening global supply and an improving demand outlook. Industrial and precious metals posted partially offsetting losses
 with short positions suffering as prices rallied on the weaker USD and positive US macroeconomic trends. Stock index holdings had little impact on the Trust in the month of July amid mixed positioning across the global indices. Stock markets advanced
 during the month on soft landing expectations and disinflation traction. Positive earnings takeaways provided additional support for stocks.

The Trust produced a gain in August. Gains came from foreign exchange (FX) and commodity holdings while stock indexes, interest rate, and credit positions produced some partially offsetting losses
 during the month. Foreign exchange trading led Trust gains in August. Shorts in the developed market currencies (versus long USD) benefited as the USD rallied sharply, following US Treasury yields which hit a 15-year high. The dollar bloc (AUD, NZD,
 CAD) and the Scandis (NOK and SEK) were the major underperformers on the month, with short AUDUSD leading Trust gains on weaker Chinese data and a rate hold from the RBA. Commodity trading was also additive for the Trust in August. Grains generated
 the largest sub-sector returns by way of a short wheat holding, which benefitted as prices fell on weak demand for US exports. Short industrial metal positions produced additional gains for the Trust as the base metals complex weakened on concerns
 about China s economy. Mixed positioning across the global stock indexes generated partially offsetting losses for the Trust. Equity indices weakened during the month as the hard vs soft landing debate continued, fueled by persistent inflation
 concerns and some weak US data that supported the peak-Fed narrative. Further, equity markets reacted to the steep rise in US yields along with an unexpected Fitch downgrade of the US. Fixed income instruments also detracted on the month. August
 kicked off with Fitch downgrading the US credit rating, which pushed Treasuries yields lower (prices higher), but weak auctions and hawkish Fed minutes sharply reversed that trend in the back half of August. US Treasuries ultimately ended the month
 lower, leaving gains in short US 30yr positioning evenly matched with losses on mixed positioning in the US 10yr note. A dismal Eurozone PMI print sparked a rally in German bonds as investors pared bets on another ECB hike, hurting short positioning.
 Short protection positions on the credit indices generated additional offsetting losses for the Trust. Credit spreads widened amid the broader sell-off in risk and the Trust suffered as a result.

The Trust produced a gain in September. Profits came from interest rate, commodities, and foreign exchange (FX) holdings, while stock and credit index positions produced some partially offsetting losses
 during the month. Fixed income instruments led Trust gains with short positioning profiting as global bond prices tumbled (yield jumped). US Treasuries sold off sharply as investors responded to the Fed s messaging that rates are set to stay higher
 for longer than previously expected. Adding to the retreat in the global bond markets, the Fed revised down their forecast for the number of 2024 interest rate cuts and the ECB signaled rates will be held higher for a sufficiently long period of
 time to quell inflation. Commodity trading also provided gains during the month. Precious metals generated the best sub-sector commodity returns for the Trust. Shorts held across the sector performed positively as continued strength in the US dollar
 and upward pressure on yields weighed on precious metal prices. Long positioning on the petroleum complex also generated gains as those energy markets advanced on tight supplies with OPEC+ leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia constricting output. The
 foreign exchange markets contributed additional gains for the Trust. Shorts in the developed market currencies (versus long the US dollar) benefited as the USD rallied sharply on back of Treasury yields, which made new highs not seen since before the
 Global Financial Crisis. While yields moved higher across many of the developed markets, US rates experienced a divergence higher during the month on back of the hawkish Fed, driving the relative strength in the greenback. Stock indices had a
 negative P L impact in September, with losses concentrated in long European holdings. Nearly all major benchmarks logged losses for the month with the risk-off trading fueled by the higher-for-longer Fed and accompanying upward pressure on
 yields. The pickup in consumer headwinds with higher energy prices and the resumption of student loans, as well as the UAW strike and looming government shutdown, also pressured equity markets lower. Short protection positions on the credit indices
 generated additional offsetting losses for the Trust as credit spreads widened amid the broader sell-off in risk.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Introduction

Past Results Not Necessarily Indicative of Future Performance 

The Trust is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or a substantial amount of the Trust s assets are subject to
 the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Trust s main line of business.

Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the Trust s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Trust s market risk is influenced by a wide
 variety of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Trust s open positions and the liquidity of
 the markets in which it trades.

The Trust rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will
 affect performance, and the Trust s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results.

Standard of Materiality 

Materiality as used in this section, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by
 such movements, taking into account the leverage and multiplier features of the Trust s market sensitive instruments.

Quantifying the Trust s Trading Value at Risk

Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements 

The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Trust s market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability
 provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). All quantitative disclosures in this section are
 deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact (such as the dollar amount of maintenance margin required for market risk sensitive instruments held at the end of the reporting
 period).

The Trust s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded is estimated in terms of Value at Risk (VaR). The Trust estimates VaR using a model based upon historical simulation (with a confidence
 level of 97.5 which involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of a trading portfolio. The VaR model takes into account linear exposures to risks, including equity and commodity prices, interest rates, foreign
 exchange rates, credit, and correlation among these variables. The hypothetical changes in portfolio value are based on daily percentage changes observed in key market indices or other market factors to which the portfolio is sensitive. The Trust s
 VaR at a one day 97.5 confidence level corresponds to the negative change in portfolio value that, based on observed market risk factors, would have been exceeded once in 40 trading days or one day in 40. VaR typically does not represent the worst
 case outcome.

The Trust uses approximately one quarter of daily market data and revalues its portfolio for each of the historical market moves that occurred over this time period. This generates a probability
 distribution of daily simulated profit and loss outcomes. The VaR is the 2.5 percentile of this distribution.

The VaR for a sector represents the 2.5 percentile of outcomes for the aggregate exposures associated with that sector alone. The current methodology used to calculate the aggregate VaR represents the
 VaR of the Trust s open positions across all market sectors, and is less than the sum of the VaRs for all such market sectors due to the diversification benefit across asset classes.

The Trust s VaR computations are based on the risk representation of the underlying benchmark for each instrument or contract and does not distinguish between exchange and non-exchange dealer-based
 instruments. It is also not based on exchange and/or dealer-based maintenance margin requirements.

VaR models, including the Trust s, are continually evolving as trading portfolios become more diverse and modeling techniques and systems capabilities improve. Please note that the VaR model is used to
 numerically quantify market risk for historic reporting purposes only and is not utilized by the Trust in its daily risk management activities. Please further note that VaR as described above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
 other entities.

Because the business of the Trust is the speculative trading of futures, forwards, and swaps, the composition of the Trust s trading portfolio can change significantly over any given time period, or
 even within a single trading day, which could positively or negatively materially impact market risk as measured by VaR.

Material Limitations of Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk

The following limitations of VaR as an assessment of market risk should be noted:

1) 

Past changes in market risk factors will not always result in accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements;

2) 

Changes in portfolio value caused by market movements may differ from those of the VaR model;

3) 

VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions;

4) 

VaR using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; and

5) 

The historical market risk factor data for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under certain unusual market movements.

VaR is not necessarily representative of historic risk nor should it be used to predict the Trust s future financial performance or its ability to manage and monitor risk. There can be no assurance that
 the Trust s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated or that such losses will not occur more than once in 40 trading days.

Non-Trading Risk

The Trust has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as the market risk they represent) are immaterial. The Trust also has
 non-trading market risk as a result of investing a portion of its available assets in U.S. Treasury Bills held at the broker and over-the-counter counterparty. The market risk represented by these investments is minimal. Finally, the Trust has
 non-trading market risk on fixed income securities held as part of its cash management program. The cash manager will use its best endeavors in the management of the assets of the Trust but provide no guarantee that any profit or interest will accrue
 to the Trust as a result of such management.

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures

The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Trust s market risk exposures except for (i) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions
 of how the Trust manages its primary market risk exposures constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act. The Trust s primary market risk exposures as
 well as the strategies used and to be used by Campbell Company for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of the Trust s risk controls to differ
 materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of
 new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Trust. There can be no assurance that the Trust s
 current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in
 the Trust.

The following represent the primary trading risk exposures of the Trust as of September 30, 2024 by market sector.

Foreign Exchange 

The Trust s currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. These
 fluctuations are influenced by interest rate changes as well as political and general economic conditions. The Trust trades in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates i.e., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
 Campbell Company does not anticipate that the risk profile of the Trust s currency sector will change significantly in the future.

Interest Rates 

Interest rate movements directly affect the price of the sovereign bond positions and interest rate swap contracts held by the Trust and indirectly the value of its stock index and currency positions.
 Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries materially impact the Trust s profitability. Campbell Company does not anticipate that the risk profile of the Trust s interest rate sector
 will change significantly in the future.

Equity Indices 

The Trust s primary equity exposure is to equity price risk in the G-7 countries as well as Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Netherlands, India, South Africa and Sweden. The stock index
 futures traded by the Trust are by law limited to futures on broadly based indices. The Trust is primarily exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in the major U.S., European and Japanese indices. Markets that trade in a narrow
 range could result in the Trust s positions being whipsawed into numerous small losses.

Credit 

The Trust s primary credit exposure is through fluctuations in the credit worthiness of a particular reference entity, basket of reference entities, or an index.

Energy 

The Trust s primary energy market exposure is to natural gas, crude oil and derivative product price movements often resulting from international political developments and ongoing conflicts in the
 Middle East and the perceived outcome. Oil and gas prices can be volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue to be experienced in this market.

Metals 

The Trust s metals market exposure is to fluctuations in the price of aluminum, copper, gold, lead, nickel, palladium, platinum, silver and zinc.

Agricultural 

The Trust s agricultural exposure is to fluctuations of the price of cattle, cocoa, coffee, corn, cotton, hogs, soy, sugar and wheat.

Table of Contents 

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure

The following were the primary non-trading risk exposures of the Trust as of September 30, 2024.

Foreign Currency Balances 

The Trust s primary foreign currency balances are in Australian Dollar, British Pounds, Canadian Dollar, Euros, Hong Kong Dollar, Japanese Yen, Singapore Dollar, South African Rand and Swedish Krona.
 The Trust controls the non-trading risk of these balances by regularly converting these balances back into dollars (no less frequently than twice a month, and more frequently if a particular foreign currency balance becomes unusually large).

Fixed Income Securities and Short Term Investments 

The Trust s primary market exposure in instruments (other than treasury positions described in the subsequent section) held other than for trading is in its fixed income portfolio. The cash manager,
 PNC, has authority to make certain investments on behalf of the Trust. All securities purchased by the cash manager on behalf of the Trust will be held in the Trust s custody account at the custodian. The cash manager will use its best endeavors in
 the management of the assets of the Trust but provides no guarantee that any profit or interest will accrue to the Trust as a result of such management.

U.S. Treasury Bill Positions Held for Margin Purposes 

The Trust also has market exposure in its U.S. Treasury Bill portfolio. The Trust holds U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities no longer than six months. Violent fluctuations in prevailing interest rates
 could cause minimal mark-to-market losses on the Trust s U.S. Treasury Bills, although substantially all of these short-term investments are held to maturity.

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure

The means by which the Trust and Campbell Company, severally, attempt to manage the risk of the Trust s open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded. Campbell 
 Company applies risk management policies to its trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be taken per risk unit of assets under management. In addition, Campbell Company follows diversification guidelines (often formulated in
 terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups), as well as reducing position sizes dynamically in response to trading losses.

General

The Trust is unaware of any (i) anticipated known demands, commitments or capital expenditures; (ii) material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in its capital resources; or (iii) trends or uncertainties
 that will have a material effect on operations. From time to time, certain regulatory agencies have proposed increased margin requirements on futures contracts. Because the Trust generally will use a small percentage of assets as margin, the Trust
 does not believe that any increase in margin requirements, as proposed, will have a material effect on the Trust s operations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Campbell Company, the managing operator of the Trust, with the participation of the managing operator s chief executive officer and chief operating officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
 design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) with respect to the Trust as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on their
 evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief operating officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in the managing operator s internal control over financial reporting applicable to
 the Trust identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal
 control over financial reporting applicable to the Trust.
