As of December 31, 2023, million and million of the Company s liquid corporate senior loans were classified in Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. 
 Other financial instruments The Company considers the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between their origination and their expected realization as well as their highly-liquid nature. Due to the short-term maturities of these instruments, Level 1 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. 
 Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize, or be liable for, upon disposition of the financial assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. The Company does not expect that changes in classifications between levels will be frequent.

 Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis (Including Impairment Charges) 
 Certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. The Company s process for identifying and recording impairment related to credit investments, real estate assets and intangible assets is discussed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate million asset-specific credit loss reserve on funded and unfunded commitments related to of the Company s first mortgage loans with an aggregate carrying value of billion. The asset-specific credit loss reserve was recorded based on the Company s estimation of the fair value of the first mortgage loans aggregate underlying collateral, less costs to sell the underlying collateral, as of September 30, 2024. These loans are therefore measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs, and are classified as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. The Company considered a variety of inputs including property performance, market data and comparable sales, as applicable. The significant unobservable inputs used include the terminal capitalization rate, which ranged from to , and the discount rate, which ranged from to . For additional information regarding the first mortgage loans, refer to Note 8 Loans Held-For-Investment. 
 As discussed in Note 4 Real Estate Assets, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, properties were deemed to be impaired due to sales prices or revised cash flow estimates that were less than their respective carrying values, and their carrying values were reduced to an estimated fair value of million, resulting in impairment charges of million. The revised cash flow estimates were a result of continued deterioration of fundamentals at certain office properties, including weakened leasing activity and increased capitalization rates, and a revision in assumed holding periods at certain properties. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain condominium units were deemed to be impaired, primarily due to a decrease in expected sales prices for certain units, and their carrying values were reduced to their estimated fair value, resulting in impairment charges of million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, real estate assets related to properties were deemed to be impaired and their carrying values were reduced to an estimated fair value of million, resulting in impairment charges of million. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, condominium unit was deemed to be impaired and its carrying value was reduced to its estimated fair value, resulting in impairment charges of . The Company estimates fair values using Level 3 inputs and a combined income and market approach, specifically using discounted cash flow analysis and recent comparable sales transactions. The evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment requires the Company s management to exercise significant judgment and to make certain key assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) terminal capitalization rates; (2) discount rates; (3) the number of years the property will be held; (4) property operating expenses; and (5) re-leasing assumptions, including the number of months to re-lease, market rental income and required tenant improvements. There are inherent uncertainties in making these estimates such as market conditions and the future performance and sustainability of the Company s tenants. The Company determined that the selling prices used to determine the fair values were Level 2 inputs.

 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the loan collateralizing one of the Company s CMBS positions was transferred from the master servicer to a special servicer due to payment default generated by halted rent payments on the underlying office properties being mortgaged. In March 2023, the underlying collateral of the loan was appraised by the special servicer, resulting in an appraisal reduction representing approximately of one of the CMBS position s tranches in which the Company is invested. Though the appraisal reduction was partially reversed during the year ended December 31, 2023, the initial appraisal reduction resulted in reduced cash flows received from the respective CMBS position during the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received notice of preliminary sales transaction activity in relation to the underlying collateral of this CMBS position, as well as an additional position in a separate tranche of this instrument, indicative of a bid below the carrying value of the investment. The Company considered various factors, including the factors noted above, in determining whether a credit loss existed. The present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the CMBS positions did not exceed their amortized cost basis, and as such the Company determined both tranches of the security the Company is invested in had incurred a credit loss. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, the CMBS positions were in maturity default as they did not mature as anticipated on the initial maturity date during December 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the CMBS positions were no longer in maturity default as the CMBS was modified to provide for an extended maturity date of July 2025 plus a extension option, as well as a permanently reduced interest rate to per annum. The Company does not intend to sell the CMBS position and it is not considered more likely than not that the Company will be forced to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost. 
 As a result of the credit loss incurred, the Company reclassified million of unrealized loss from other comprehensive income (loss) on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) to increase in provision for credit losses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023, and recorded an incremental million to increase in provision for credit losses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations identified as part of the Company s quantitative credit loss assessment during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a million increase to the provision for credit losses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the CMBS positions identified as having incurred a credit loss was million prior to any credit loss provisions. The Company will continue to monitor for changes in expected cash flows in order to continue to measure the credit loss. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were CMBS positions with an aggregate fair value of million with unrealized losses reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Upon evaluating these securities at the individual security level, the Company concluded that the unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2024 were noncredit-related and would be recovered from the securities estimated future cash flows. The Company considered various factors in reaching this conclusion, including that the Company did not intend to sell the securities, it was not considered more likely than not that the Company would be forced to sell the securities prior to recovering the amortized cost, and there were no material credit events that would have caused the Company to conclude that the amortized cost would not be recovered.

 interest rate cap agreements matured. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did have any derivative instruments. 
 Additional disclosures related to the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments are included in Note 3 Fair Value Measurements. The notional amount under the derivative instruments is an indication of the extent of the Company s involvement in each instrument, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks. 
 Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. The Company had interest rate caps which were used to manage exposure to interest rate movements, but did not meet the requirements to be designated as a hedging instrument. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges is recorded directly to earnings in other (expense) income, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges in order to hedge the variability of the anticipated cash flows on the Company s variable rate debt. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments designated as hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), with a portion of the amount subsequently reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable rate debt. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amounts were reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) as a change to interest expense. unrealized amounts on interest rate swaps were remaining in other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company includes cash flows from interest rate swap agreements in net cash flows provided by operating activities on its condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, as the Company s accounting policy is to present

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a complete discussion of such risk factors, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning ascribed to those terms in Part I Financial Information of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained therein, and the terms we, us, our and the Company refer to CIM Real Estate Finance Trust, Inc. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the federal securities laws, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that reflect our expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. We have attempted to identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as may, will, seek, expects, anticipates, believes, targets, intends, should, estimates, could, continue, assume, projects, plans or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, those discussed below. In addition, these risks and uncertainties include those associated with general economic, market and other conditions. We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable by law. We do not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying assumptions or new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required to satisfy our obligations under federal securities law. The forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risk factors identified in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The following are some, but not all, of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
 We are subject to risks associated with bankruptcies or insolvencies of our borrowers and tenants and from borrower or tenant defaults generally. 
 Our credit and real estate investments subject us to domestic and international political, economic, capital markets and other conditions and events. 
 We are subject to fluctuations in interest rates which could reduce our ability to generate income on our credit investments. 
 We are subject to an increase in inflation that could increase our credit and real estate portfolio related costs at a higher rate than our rental income and other revenue and adversely impact demand for rental space and future extensions of our tenants leases. 
 We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as significant disruptions of CIM Group s information technology IT networks and related systems. 
 We are subject to competition from entities engaged in lending which may impact the availability of origination and acquisition opportunities acceptable to us. 
 We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all. 
 We are subject to risks associated with tenant, geographic and industry concentrations with respect to our investments and properties. 
 Our properties, intangible assets and other assets, as well as the property securing our loans or other investments, may be subject to impairment charges. 
 We could be subject to unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities that may arise from dispositions. 
 We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties and we may suffer delays or be unable to acquire, dispose of, or lease properties on advantageous terms. 
 We have substantial indebtedness, which may affect our ability to pay distributions and expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and the risk of default under our debt obligations.

Table of Contents 

We are subject to risks associated with the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt. 
 We may not be able to maintain profitability. 
 We may not generate cash flows sufficient to pay our distributions to stockholders or meet our debt service obligations. 
 Our continued compliance with debt covenants depends on many factors and could be impacted by current or future economic conditions. 
 We may be affected by risks resulting from losses in excess of insured limits. 
 We may fail to remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We could be subject to a material tax liability if our sales of properties are treated as prohibited transactions. 
 We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability or reduce our operating flexibility. 
 We may be unable to list our shares on a national securities exchange in a particular timeframe or at all. 
 If we, our operating partnership and any other subsidiaries do not maintain exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, we will be subject to significant regulation and restrictions on our business and investments, which could materially and adversely impact us. 
 Definitions 
 We use certain defined terms throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have the following meanings: 
 The phrase annualized rental income refers to the straight-line rental revenue under our leases on operating properties owned as of the respective reporting date, which includes the effect of rent escalations and any tenant concessions, such as free rent, and excludes any contingent rent, such as percentage rent. Management uses annualized rental income as a basis for tenant, industry and geographic concentrations and other metrics within the portfolio. Annualized rental income is not indicative of future performance. 
 Under a net lease, the tenant occupying the leased property (usually as a single tenant) does so in much the same manner as if the tenant were the owner of the property. The tenant generally agrees that it will either have no ability or only limited ability to terminate the lease or abate rent prior to the expiration of the term of the lease as a result of real estate driven events such as casualty, condemnation or failure by the landlord to fulfill its obligations under the lease. There are various forms of net leases, most typically classified as either triple-net or double-net. Triple-net leases typically require the tenant to pay all expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, including roof, structure and parking lot). Double-net leases typically hold the landlord responsible for the capital expenditures for the roof and structure, while the tenant is responsible for all lease payments and remaining operating expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance). 
 
 Overview 
 We are a non-traded REIT that seeks to attain attractive risk-adjusted returns and create long term value for our stockholders by investing in a diversified portfolio of senior secured mortgage loans, creditworthy long-term net-leased property investments and other senior loan and liquid credit investments. Our investment strategy allows us to adapt over time in order to respond to evolving market conditions and to capitalize on investment opportunities that may arise at different points in the economic and real estate investment cycle. Subject to market conditions, we expect to pursue a listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange at such time as our Board determines that such a listing would be in the best interests of our stockholders, though we can provide no assurance that a listing will happen in a particular timeframe or at all. 
 We were formed on July 27, 2010, and we elected to be taxed, and conduct our operations to qualify, as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have no paid employees and are externally managed by CMFT Management and, with respect to investments in securities and certain other of our investments, our Investment Advisor, each of which is an affiliate of CIM Group, a vertically-integrated community-focused real estate and infrastructure owner, operator, lender and developer. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our loan portfolio consisted of 71 loans with a net book value of 3.5 billion, and 22 investments in real estate-related securities and other of 389.6 million. The Company conducts and expects to continue to conduct its commercial real estate lending business through CLR, a Maryland statutory trust and subsidiary of the Company which we expect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of September 30, 2024, CLR holds a diversified portfolio of approximately 1.4 billion of the Company s senior secured mortgage loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, we owned 191 properties, which consisted of 180 retail properties, seven office properties, and four industrial properties, representing 16 industry sectors and comprising approximately 6.0 million rentable square feet of commercial space located in 36 states, with a net book value of 1.0 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we owned condominium developments with a net book value of 61.4 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we disposed of three properties encompassing approximately 260,000 gross rentable square feet, as further discussed in Note 4 Real Estate Assets to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our operating results and cash flows are primarily influenced by interest income from our credit investments, rental and other property income from our commercial properties, interest expense on our indebtedness and credit investments and related expenses. In general, our business model is such that rising interest rates will correlate to increases in our net income, while declining interest rates will correlate to decreases in our net income. As of September 30, 2024, 99.1 of our CMBS and loans held-for-investment by net book value earned a floating rate of interest, indexed to SOFR, and were financed with liabilities that pay interest at floating rates, which resulted in an amount of net equity that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. CMFT Management reviews our investment portfolio and is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. In addition, as 100.0 of our rentable square feet was under lease, including any month-to-month agreements, as of September 30, 2024, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.7 years, we believe our exposure to changes in commercial rental rates on our portfolio is substantially mitigated, except for vacancies caused by tenant bankruptcies or other factors. Our manager regularly monitors the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing each tenant s financial results, any available credit rating agency reports on the tenant or guarantor, the operating history of the property with such tenant, the tenant s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant s industry segment and other information for changes and possible trends. If our manager identifies significant changes or trends that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of a tenant, it will gather a more in-depth knowledge of the tenant s financial condition and, if necessary, attempt to mitigate the tenant credit risk by evaluating the possible sale of the property or identifying a possible replacement tenant should the current tenant fail to perform on the lease. 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been characterized by a mix of positive and challenging developments leading to continued volatility in global markets. Investor concerns over inflation, higher interest rates, slowing economic growth, political and regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical conditions have persisted. 
 Continued inflation caused the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2022 and 2023. Although the majority of our business model is such that elevated interest rates will, all else being equal, correlate to increases in our net income, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our existing borrowers, tenants and owned property values. The Federal Reserve has begun to, and has indicated that it may continue to, decrease interest rates in 2024. In a period of declining interest rates, our interest income on floating-rate investments may generally decrease, subject to the impact of interest rate floors in our investment portfolio. 
 For a complete discussion of risk factors related to the economy that could impact our lending and our business, see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 .

 Credit Segment 
 Revenues 
 Our Credit segment revenues decreased 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the suspension of interest income on three of our risk-rated 5 first mortgage loans with a carrying value of 372.2 million that were placed on nonaccrual status and were past due on their interest payments as of September 30, 2024, as well as a decrease in the overall size of our investment portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we held credit investments with an outstanding principal balance of 4.5 billion compared to credit investments with an outstanding principal balance of 5.0 billion as of September 30, 2023. 
 Expenses

The decrease in our Credit segment expenses of 31.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 25.7 million decrease in the provision for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a net decrease in the asset-specific credit loss provision of 20.9 million on funded and unfunded commitments recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was further driven by a 5.5 million decrease in interest expense primarily due to decreased outstanding borrowings used to fund credit investments, as well as a decrease in average index rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Other Income 
 Other income for our Credit segment consists of gain on investment in unconsolidated entities, unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, along with dividend income from our equity securities. The increase in our Credit segment other income of 939,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 4.5 million unrealized gain on equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a 2.1 million unrealized loss on equity securities for the same period in 2023. The increase was further driven by a 1.5 million increase in gain on investment in unconsolidated entities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was partially offset by the recognition of 3.7 million of other

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in property operating expenses of 3.3 million, primarily driven by decreased condominium-related legal expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was further offset by a decrease in interest expense, net of 788,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, driven by the paydown and termination of the variable rate debt assumed by the Company upon completing the January 2021 foreclosure of assets which previously secured the Company's mezzanine loans (the Assumed Variable Rate Debt during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Same Store Analysis 
 Our results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate assets. We review our stabilized operating results, measured by net operating income, from properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods, referred to as same store properties, and we believe that the presentation of operating results for same store properties provides useful information to stockholders. Net operating income is 
 60 

Table of Contents 

a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company s operating performance. Net operating income is considered by management to be a helpful supplemental performance measure, as it enables management to evaluate the impact of occupancy, rents, leasing activity and other controllable property operating results at our real estate properties, and it provides a consistent method for the comparison of our properties. We define net operating income as operating revenues less operating expenses, which exclude (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense and other non-property related revenue and expense items such as (a) general and administrative expenses, (b) expense reimbursements to related parties, (c) management fees, (d) transaction-related expenses, (e) real estate impairment, (f) increase in provision for credit losses, (g) gain on disposition of real estate and condominium developments, net, (h) merger-related expenses, net and (i) interest income. Our calculation of net operating income may not be comparable to that of other REITs and should not be considered to be more relevant or accurate in evaluating our operating performance than the current GAAP methodology used in calculating net income (loss). In determining the same store property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods, except for properties during the current or prior year that were under development or redevelopment.

 Share Redemptions 
 Our share redemption program permits our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We will limit the number of shares redeemed pursuant to our share redemption program as follows: (1) we will not redeem in excess of 5 of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12 months prior to the end of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid; and (2) funding for the redemption of shares will be limited, among other things, to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares under our DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date. In an effort to accommodate redemption requests throughout the calendar year, we will generally limit quarterly redemptions to approximately 1.25 of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12-month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid, and to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares in the respective quarter under the Secondary DRIP Offering. Any of the foregoing limits might prevent us from accommodating all redemption requests made in any fiscal quarter or in any 12-month period. We will determine whether we have sufficient funds and/or shares available as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal quarter, but in any event prior to the applicable payment date. If we cannot purchase all shares presented for redemption in any fiscal quarter, based upon insufficient cash available from the sale of shares under our DRIP and/or the limit on the number of shares we may redeem during any quarter or year, we will give priority to the redemption of deceased stockholders shares and stockholders with exigent circumstances, as determined in our sole discretion and accompanied by such evidentiary documentation as we may request. While the shares of deceased stockholders and stockholders determined to have exigent circumstances will be included in calculating the maximum number of shares that may be redeemed in any annual or quarterly period, they will not be subject to the annual or quarterly percentage caps; therefore, if the volume of requests to redeem deceased stockholders shares and 
 63 

Table of Contents 

stockholders determined to have exigent circumstances in a particular quarter were large enough to cause the annual or quarterly percentage caps to be exceeded, even if no other redemption requests were processed, the redemptions of deceased stockholders shares and stockholders determined to have exigent circumstances would be completed in full, assuming sufficient proceeds from the sale of shares under our DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date, were available. If sufficient proceeds from the sale of shares under our DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date, were not available to pay all such redemptions in full, the requests to redeem deceased stockholders shares and shareholders determined to have exigent circumstances would be honored on a pro rata basis. We next will give priority to requests for full redemption of accounts with a balance of 250 shares or less at the time we receive the request, in order to reduce the expense of maintaining small accounts. Thereafter, we will honor the remaining redemption requests on a pro rata basis. Following such quarterly redemption period, if a stockholder would like to resubmit the unsatisfied portion of the prior request for redemption, such stockholder must submit a new request for redemption of such shares prior to the last day of the new quarter. Unfulfilled requests for redemption will not be carried over automatically to subsequent redemption periods. In addition, our management reserves the right, in its sole discretion at any time, and from time to time, to reject any request for redemption for any reason. Our Board may choose to amend the terms of, suspend or terminate our share redemption program at any time in its sole discretion if it believes that such action is in the best interest of us and our stockholders. Any material modifications or suspension of the share redemption program will be disclosed to our stockholders as promptly as practicable in our reports filed with the SEC and via our website. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received valid redemption requests under our share redemption program totaling approximately 109.9 million shares, of which we redeemed approximately 3.7 million shares as of September 30, 2024 for 22.4 million (at an average redemption price of 6.09 per share) and approximately 1.8 million shares subsequent to September 30, 2024 for 10.7 million (at an average redemption price of 6.09 per share). The remaining redemption requests relating to 104.4 million shares went unfulfilled. A valid redemption request is one that complies with the applicable requirements and guidelines of the share redemption program then in effect. The share redemptions were funded with proceeds from the Secondary DRIP Offering. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We expect to utilize proceeds from net cash provided by operations, cash proceeds from the sale of credit investments, principal payments received on credit investments, cash proceeds from real estate asset dispositions, proceeds from the Secondary DRIP Offering, proceeds from the sale of subsidiary equity, distributions, as well as secured or unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders to finance our future acquisitions and loan originations, repayment of certain indebtedness and for general corporate uses. The sources of our operating cash flows will primarily be provided by interest income from our portfolio of credit investments and the rental and other property income received from current and future leased properties. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our debt facilities, which are set forth in the following table (in thousands):

 (1) Variance driven by late quarter timing of CMBS sales and debt pay downs primarily in connection with the amended and restated Master Repurchase Agreement with Barclays (as described in further detail in Note 10 Repurchase Facilities, Notes Payable and Credit Facilities). 
 Capital Resources 
 Our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition or origination of credit investments and real estate, and the payment of tenant improvements, acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions, redemptions and interest and principal on current and any future debt financings, including principal repayments of 1.4 billion within the next 12 months, 127.4 million of which has a rolling term that resets monthly, as further discussed in Note 10 Repurchase Facilities, Notes Payable and Credit Facilities to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments of 265.9 million related to 35 loans and unfunded commitments of 60.5 million related to the NewPoint JV. Loan funding commitments are generally subject to certain conditions and the satisfaction of borrower milestones. Therefore, the exact timing and amounts of such future loan fundings are uncertain and will depend on the current and future performance of the underlying collateral assets. We expect to fund our loan commitments over the remaining term of the related loans, which have a weighted-average future funding period of 3.2 years. 
 Generally, we expect to meet our liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, cash proceeds from the sale of credit investments, principal payments received on credit investments, cash proceeds from real estate asset dispositions, proceeds from the Secondary DRIP Offering, proceeds from the sale of subsidiary equity, distributions, as well as secured or unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders to finance our future acquisitions and loan originations, repayment of certain indebtedness and for general corporate uses. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after certain capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, are paid; however, we have used, and may continue to use, other sources to fund distributions, as necessary, including borrowings on our unencumbered assets. To the extent that cash flows from operations are lower, distributions paid to our stockholders may be lower. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from the Secondary DRIP Offering or debt financings will be used to fund acquisitions, loan originations, certain capital expenditures, repayments of outstanding debt or distributions and redemptions to our stockholders. We believe that the resources stated above will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from sources other than those described above within the next 12 months.

Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had debt outstanding with a carrying value of 3.3 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 6.0 . See Note 10 Repurchase Facilities, Notes Payable and Credit Facilities to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for certain terms of our debt outstanding.

The allocation of our unfunded loan commitments is based on the earlier of the commitment expiration date or the final maturity date; however, we may be obligated to fund these commitments earlier than such date. This table does not include 60.5 million of unfunded commitments related to the NewPoint JV. 
 (3) Interest payments on the variable rate debt, credit facilities and repurchase facilities have been calculated based on outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024 through their respective maturity dates. This is only an estimate as actual amounts borrowed and interest rates could vary over time. 
 We expect to incur additional borrowings in the future to acquire additional properties and credit investments. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property. As of September 30, 2024, our ratio of debt to total gross assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities was 62.6 . 
 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 39.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased interest income of 14.0 million as a result of our three first mortgage loans that were placed on nonaccrual status and were past due on their interest payments as of September 30, 2024, along with the disposition of five properties and a net decrease in credit investments of 531.5 million subsequent to September 30, 2023. See Results of Operations for a more complete discussion of the factors impacting our operating performance. 
 Investing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities decreased by 58.3 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets and condominium units of 903.5 million, as the Company disposed of three properties and 11 condominium units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 186 properties and 14 condominium units disposed of during the same period in 2023. The change was offset by 542.0 million of net proceeds from loans held-for-investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the 164.6 million net investment in loans held-for-investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was further offset by 71.0 million of net proceeds from real estate-related securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the 85.7 million net investment in real estate-related securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities increased by 298.0 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in net repayments on the repurchase facilities, notes payable and credit facilities of 291.9 million.

Election as a REIT 
 We elected to be taxed, and operate our business to qualify, as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain requirements relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of assets, distributions of income to our stockholders and recordkeeping. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders so long as we distribute at least 90 of our annual taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains). 
 If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any reason in a taxable year and applicable relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We will not be able to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders in any year in which we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also will be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. No provision for federal income taxes has been made in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. We are subject to certain state and local taxes related to the operations of properties in certain locations, which have been provided for in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates 
 Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We consider our critical accounting policies to be the following: 
 Current Expected Credit Losses; 
 Recoverability of Real Estate Assets; and 
 Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets. 
 A complete description of such policies and our considerations is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and related notes thereto. 
 
 Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
 We have entered into agreements with CMFT Management and our Investment Advisor whereby we agree to pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, CMFT Management, the Investment Advisor or their affiliates. In addition, we have invested in, and may continue to invest in, certain assets with funds that are advised by an affiliate of CMFT Management. We may also originate loans to third parties that use the proceeds to finance the acquisition of real estate from funds that are advised by an affiliate of CMFT Management. See Note 12 Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 Richard S. Ressler, the chairman of our Board, chief executive officer and president, who is also a founder and principal of CIM Group and is an officer/director of certain of its affiliates, is the vice president of our manager. Additionally, one of our 
 67 

Table of Contents 

directors, Jason Schreiber, is an employee of CIM Group. Nathan D. DeBacker, our chief financial officer, principal accounting officer and treasurer, is an employee of CIM and a vice president of our manager, and is an officer of certain of its affiliates. As such, there may be conflicts of interest where CMFT Management or its affiliates, while serving in the capacity as sponsor, general partner, officer, director, key personnel and/or advisor for CIM Group or another program sponsored or operated by affiliates of our manager, may be in conflict with us in connection with providing services to other real estate-related programs related to property acquisitions, property dispositions, and property management, among others. The compensation arrangements between affiliates of CMFT Management and these other real estate programs sponsored or operated by affiliates of our manager could influence the advice provided to us. See Part I, Item 1. Business Conflicts of Interest in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable rate borrowings. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to manage our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We do not intend to hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and the related financing obligations. In general, we seek to match the interest rate characteristics of our investments with the interest rate characteristics of any related financing obligations such as repurchase agreements, bank credit facilities, term loans, revolving facilities and securitizations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 2.5 billion of variable rate debt, excluding any debt subject to interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements, if any, and therefore, we are exposed to interest rate changes in SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, an increase or decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of 12.6 million per year. 
 As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of September 30, 2024, it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date. The information presented herein has limited predictive value. Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations. 
 These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on our borrowing costs and assume no other changes in our capital structure. 
 Credit Risk 
 Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. We are subject to tenant, geographic and industry concentrations. Any downturn of the economic conditions in one or more of these tenants, states or industries could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to us. 
 The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs i.e. , expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We believe that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants and mitigation options. 
 Our loans and investments are also subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the owners ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay 
 68 

Table of Contents 

interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, our manager reviews our investment portfolios and in certain instances is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that no controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to litigation or claims. We are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, to which we or our subsidiaries are a party or to which our properties are the subject. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Our share redemption program permits our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We will limit the number of shares redeemed pursuant to our share redemption program as follows: (1) we will not redeem in excess of 5 of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12 months prior to the end of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid; and (2) funding for the redemption of shares will be limited, among other things, to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares under our DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date. In an effort to accommodate redemption requests throughout the calendar year, we will generally limit quarterly redemptions to approximately 1.25 of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12-month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid, and to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares in the respective quarter under the Secondary DRIP Offering. Any of the foregoing limits might prevent us from accommodati ng all redemption requests made in any fiscal quarter or in any 12-month pe riod. As of September 30, 2024, the most recent estimated per share NAV was 6.09, which was determined by the Board on February 29, 2024 using a valuation date of January 31, 2024. 
 In general, we redeem shares on a quarterly basis. Shares are redeemed with a trade date no later than the end of the month following the end of each fiscal quarter. Any redemption capacity that is not used as a result of the withdrawal or rejection of redemption requests may be used to satisfy the redemption requests of other stockholders received for that fiscal quarter, and such redemption payments may be made at a later time than when that quarter s redemption payments are made. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we redeemed shares, including those redeemable due to death, as follows: 
 Period (1) 
 Total Number of Shares Redeemed Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs July 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 7,358 6.09 7,358 (2) August 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 1,759,575 6.09 1,759,575 (2) September 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 23,585 6.09 23,585 (2) Total 1,790,518 1,790,518 (2)
