CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, should, expects, might, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, seek, would or continue, or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition liquidity and results of operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in our subsequent periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. 
 Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ include: 
 our dependence on revenue from the property and casualty insurance industries, and specifically automotive insurance, and exposure to risks related to those industries; 

our dependence on our relationships with insurance providers with no long-term minimum financial commitments; 

our reliance on a small number of insurance providers for a significant portion of our revenue; 

our dependence on third-party media sources for a significant portion of visitors to our websites and marketplace; 

our ability to attract consumers searching for insurance to our websites and marketplace through Internet search engines, display advertising, social media, content-based online advertising and other online sources; 

any limitations restricting our ability to market to users or collect and use data derived from user activities; 

risks related to cybersecurity incidents or other network disruptions; 

risks related to the use of artificial intelligence; 

our ability to develop new and enhanced products and services to attract and retain consumers and insurance providers, and to successfully monetize them; 

the impact of competition in our industry and innovation by our competitors; 

our ability to hire and retain necessary qualified employees to expand our operations; 

our ability to stay abreast of and comply with new or modified laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business, including with respect to the insurance industry, telemarketing restrictions and data privacy requirements; 

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and maintain and build our brand; 

our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, variable marketing margin, operating expenses, cash flows and ability to achieve, and maintain, future profitability; 

our ability to properly collect, process, store, share, disclose and use consumer information and other data; and 

the future trading prices of our Class A common stock.

 of total revenue in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Commission revenue from auto insurance carriers consists of constrained LTVs of commission payments the Company expects to receive for selling an insurance policy based on the effective date of the policy. The Company s estimate of constrained LTVs is based on an analysis of historical commission payment trends for relevant policies to establish an expected lifetime value and incorporates management s judgment in interpreting those trends to calculate LTVs and to apply constraints to such LTVs. The most significant factor impacting historical trends is average policy duration. The Company applies a constraint to its estimated LTVs to only recognize the amount of variable consideration that it believes is probable that it will be entitled to receive and will not be subject to a significant revenue reversal in the future. To the extent that commission payment trends change or the underlying factors impacting commission payments change, the Company s estimate of constrained LTVs could be materially impacted. To the extent the Company makes changes to its estimates of constrained LTVs, it recognizes any material impact of the change to commission revenue in the reporting period in which the change is made, including revisions of estimated lifetime commissions either below or in excess of previously estimated constrained LTVs recognized as an adjustment to revenue and the related contract asset. The Company recognizes revenue for new policies by applying the latest estimated constrained LTV for that product.

Amounts collected during the period are added to the deferred revenue balance.

There have been no other material changes to the Company s leases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, please read Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Indemnification Agreements In the normal course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to third parties and enters into commitments and guarantees Agreements under which it may be required to make payments. The duration of these Agreements varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. Furthermore, many of these Agreements do not limit the Company s maximum potential payment exposure. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any claims under indemnification arrangements will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies The Company is from time to time subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of its business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe, based on its current knowledge, that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties, and cannot be predicted with certainty. It is possible that an adverse outcome of any matter could be material to the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole for any particular reporting period of occurrence. In addition, it is possible that a matter may prompt litigation or additional investigations or proceedings by other government agencies or private litigants. On May 15, 2024, Tim Presto, individually and in his capacity as Seller Representative of Ryan McClintock, Edward Hames and Tim Presto, the former equity owners (collectively, the Sellers of Kanopy Insurance Center, LLC, One Eight Software, Inc., Parachute Insurance Services Corp., and Policy Fuel, LLC (collectively, the Acquired Entities ), brought a civil action in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware against the Company alleging, among other things, breaches of the Equity Purchase Agreement governing the Company s acquisition of the Sellers equity interests in the Acquired Entities (the Purchase Agreement ). Among other claims, the Seller Representative alleges, principally, that the Sellers are entitled to payment in the form of a combination of common stock and performance stock units pursuant to the earnout provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, based on the Seller Representative's assertion that the Acquired Entities would have achieved certain revenue thresholds for the 12-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, absent the alleged breaches of the Purchase Agreement. The complaint generally seeks an unspecified amount of damages related to such claims. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuit and believes it has substantial defenses to the claims asserted by the Seller Representative and that it complied with its contractual obligations under the Purchase Agreement in all respects. Nevertheless, because the case is still in the preliminary stages, the Company cannot predict or determine the timing or final outcome of this matter at this time or the effect that any adverse determinations the lawsuit may have on its business, financial condition or results of operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We operate a leading online marketplace for insurance shopping, connecting consumers with insurance provider customers, which includes both carriers and agents. Our vision is to become the largest online source of insurance policies by using data, technology and knowledgeable advisors to make insurance simpler, more affordable and personalized. Our results-driven marketplace, powered by our proprietary data and technology platform, is improving the way insurance providers attract and connect with consumers shopping for insurance. 
 We operate a marketplace to connect insurance providers to a large volume of high-intent, pre-validated consumer referrals that match the insurers specific underwriting and profitability requirements. The transparency of our marketplace, as well as the campaign management tools we offer, are designed to make it easy for insurance carriers and third-party agents to evaluate the performance of their marketing spend on our platform and manage their own return on investment. We present consumers with a single starting point for a comprehensive insurance shopping experience where consumers can engage with insurance carriers through multiple channels based on their preferences. Our marketplace enables consumers to choose to visit an insurance provider s website to purchase a policy or engage with a carrier or agent by phone or submit their data to insurance providers to receive quotes. Our services are free for consumers, and we derive our revenue from consumer inquires sold as referrals to insurance providers and directly from commissions on sales of policies by our direct to consumer, or DTC, insurance agency. 
 In 2023, we exited our health insurance vertical, an area that would have required significant capital investment and scale to effectively compete amid an increasingly unpredictable regulatory environment, to increase focus on core verticals, and implemented a workforce reduction plan, or the Reduction Plan, to improve operating efficiency. We refer to the exit of our health insurance vertical and the Reduction Plan as our restructuring, which we completed by September 30, 2023. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total revenue was 144.5 million and 55.0 million, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 162.7 . We had net income of 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss of 29.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and had 18.8 million and (1.9) million in adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total revenue was 352.7 million and 232.2 million, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 51.9 . We had net income of 19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss of 44.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and had 39.3 million and 1.3 million in adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measure for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to net income (loss) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our performance and future growth depend on a number of factors that present opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Auto insurance industry risk 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived 88 and 79 , respectively, of our revenue from auto insurance providers and our financial results depend on the performance of the auto insurance industry. Furthermore, total revenue from our largest auto insurance carrier customer was 39 and 20 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the last two years, the auto insurance industry experienced deteriorated underwriting performance due to a rise in claims, inflation, and inadequate policy premiums. This deteriorated underwriting performance caused our insurance carrier customers to reduce spending on new customer acquisition, which had a negative impact on the pricing and demand for consumer referrals in our marketplace throughout 2023. The state of the auto insurance market remains volatile and while we have seen improvements in spending patterns in 2024, including from our largest carrier, not all of our carrier customers have increased their 
 20 

Table of Contents 

spend in a proportional or significant manner, and a full recovery could be prolonged by further cost inflation, increased claim severity and frequency, or insufficient policy premium increases. 
 Expanding consumer traffic 
 Our success depends in part on the growth of our consumer traffic. We have historically increased consumer traffic to our marketplace by expanding existing advertising channels and adding new channels such as by engaging with consumers through our verified partner network. Over the long term, we plan to increase consumer traffic by leveraging the features and growing the data assets of our platform. While we plan to grow consumer traffic, we have the ability to decrease advertising spend when the revenue associated with such consumer traffic does not result in incremental profit to our business or in response to lower demand for consumer referrals. Further, our profitability will be impacted by our ability to acquire quote requests in significant volume, at prices that are attractive, and that represent high-intent shoppers for which insurance providers will purchase referrals. 
 Increasing the number of insurance providers and their respective spend in our marketplace 
 Our success also depends on our ability to retain and grow our insurance provider network. Historically, we have generally expanded both the number of insurance providers and the spend per provider on our platform. In the more recent past, we experienced periods of decreasing carrier spend in the automotive insurance vertical as described above. 
 Regulation 
 Our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from time to time as a result of changes to federal, state, and industry-based laws and regulations, or changes to standards concerning the enforcement thereof. Our business could be affected directly because we operate websites, conduct telephonic and email marketing, and collect, store, share, and use consumer information and other data. Our business also could be affected indirectly if our customers were to adjust their operations as a result of regulatory changes and enforcement activity. For example, since late 2023, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has been signaling, in public statements and enforcement actions, a new position that consent to receive robocalls under the Telemarketing Sales Rule must be received directly from the consumer, rather than through a third party such as a lead generator. In addition, on January 26, 2024, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the FCC published regulations which, among other things, amend the consent requirements of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 TCPA to close what the FCC refers to as the lead generator loophole by requiring one-to-one consent for outbound telemarketing calls or texts made using an automatic telephone dialing system or pre-recorded or artificial voice messages to wireless or residential numbers. The new one-to-one consent rule is scheduled to take effect on January 27, 2025. 
 Although it remains unclear how these changes may ultimately be implemented or interpreted, we anticipate that they will have an adverse impact on the market for insurance quote requests and will require us and our third-party sources to modify our marketing practices and policies. While we have been and will continue to analyze our marketing practices and policies in order to mitigate the impact on our business and to ensure continuing compliance with the new rules, there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. 
 In addition, a number of states have enacted (and others are considering) broad data privacy laws that could affect our business. Although it remains unclear how these new privacy laws may be modified or interpreted, their effects could have an impact on our business, and may require us to modify our data use practices and policies and incur compliance-related costs and expenses. 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We regularly review a number of metrics, including GAAP operating results and the key metrics listed below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make operating and strategic decisions. Some of these metrics are non-financial metrics or are financial metrics that are not defined by GAAP.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, interest income and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we present in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to supplement the financial information we present on a GAAP basis. We monitor and present Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing our business. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Also, Adjusted EBITDA may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), please see Non-GAAP Financial Measure . 
 Variable Marketing Margin 
 We define variable marketing margin, or VMM, as revenue, as reported in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), less advertising costs (a component of sales and marketing expense, as reported in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)). We use VMM to measure the efficiency of individual advertising and consumer acquisition sources and to make trade-off decisions to manage our return on advertising. We do not use VMM as a measure of profitability. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate our revenue primarily from consumer inquiries sold as referrals to insurance provider customers, consisting of carriers and agents, as well as to indirect distributors. To simplify the quoting process for the consumer and improve performance for the provider, we are able to provide consumer-submitted quote request data along with each referral. We recognize revenue from consumer referrals at the time of delivery. We support three secure consumer referral formats: 
 Clicks: An online-to-online referral, with a handoff of the consumer to the provider s website. 

Data: An online-to-offline referral, with quote request data transmitted to the provider for follow-up. 

Calls: An online-to-offline referral for outbound calls and an offline-to-offline referral for inbound calls, with the consumer and provider connected by phone. 

We also generate revenue from commissions paid to us by insurance carriers for the sale of policies in our automotive insurance vertical, and prior to our exit from health, in our health insurance vertical. Commission revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of our performance obligation, which we consider to be submission of the policy application to the insurance carrier. We recognize revenue based on our constrained estimate of commission payments we expect to receive over the lifetime of the policies sold, which we refer to as constrained LTVs, of commission payments. Commission revenue represented less than 10 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 For the periods presented, our total revenue consisted of revenue generated within our insurance verticals as follows:

Table of Contents 

We expect an overall increase in revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023, including in our automotive and home and renters verticals, as we anticipate increased spending from our carrier partners. We expect revenue from our other insurance verticals to significantly decrease from 2023 to 2024 as a result of our exit from the health insurance vertical in 2023. 
 Cost and Operating Expenses 
 Our cost and operating expenses consist of cost of revenue, sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative expenses, restructuring and other charges, and acquisition-related costs. 
 We allocate certain overhead expenses, such as rent, utilities, office supplies and depreciation and amortization of general office assets, to cost of revenue and operating expense categories based on headcount. As a result, an overhead expense allocation is reflected in cost of revenue and sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expense categories. Personnel-related costs included in cost of revenue and operating expense categories include wages, fringe benefit costs and stock-based compensation expense. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue is comprised primarily of the costs of operating our marketplace and delivering consumer referrals to our customers. These costs consist primarily of technology service costs including hosting, software, data services, and third-party call center costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes depreciation and amortization of our platform technology assets and personnel-related costs. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of advertising and marketing expenditures as well as personnel-related costs for employees engaged in sales, marketing, data analytics and consumer acquisition functions and amortization of sales and marketing-related intangible assets. Advertising expenditures consist of variable costs that are related to attracting consumers to our marketplace, generating consumer quote requests, including the cost of quote requests we acquire from our verified partner network, and promoting our marketplace to carriers and agents. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Marketing costs consist primarily of content and creative development, public relations, memberships, and event costs. We expect our sales and marketing expense will increase as we expect increased carrier spend for referrals in 2024, which will impact our advertising expenditures, though we expect personnel-related costs to decrease in 2024 from 2023 as a result of the Reduction Plan. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for software development and product management. We have focused our research and development efforts on improving ease of use and functionality of our existing marketplace platform and developing new offerings and internal tools. We primarily expense research and development costs. Direct development costs related to software enhancements that add functionality are capitalized and amortized as a component of cost of revenue. We expect that research and development expense will increase slightly in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense consists of personnel-related costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, technical support and administrative personnel as well as the costs associated with professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, insurance premiums and payment processing and billing costs. We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) consists of interest income and other income (expense). Interest income consists of interest earned on invested cash balances. Other income (expense) consists of miscellaneous income (expense) unrelated to our core operations. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we present in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

Adjusted EBITDA . We define adjusted EBITDA as our net income (loss), excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, interest income and income taxes. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). We monitor and present in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing our business. In particular, we believe that excluding the impact of these items in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance. 
 We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. We believe adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense as it has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring non-cash expense for our business; 

adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; 

adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring and other charges that affect cash available to us; 

adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition-related costs that affect cash available to us and the change in fair value of non-cash contingent consideration; 

adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash received from interest income on our investments, which affects the cash available to us; 

adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes that affect cash available to us; and 

the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. 

In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. 
 The following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Revenue increased by 89.5 million from 55.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 144.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue was due to an increase of 86.9 million in our automotive vertical and an increase of 3.3 million in our home and renters insurance vertical, partially offset by a decrease of 0.7 million in our other insurance verticals. The increase in revenue from our automotive vertical was due to an increase in carrier spend for referrals of 87.4 million, primarily from our largest customer. The increase in revenue from our home and renters insurance vertical was primarily due to an increase in carrier spend for referrals. The decrease in revenue from our other insurance verticals was due to a decrease in carrier spend for referrals due primarily to our exit from the health insurance vertical.

Revenue increased by 120.5 million from 232.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 352.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue was due to an increase of 127.6 million in our automotive vertical and an increase of 9.6 million in our home and renters insurance vertical, partially offset by a decrease of 16.8 million in our other insurance verticals. The increase in revenue from our automotive vertical was due to an increase in carrier spend for referrals of 132.1 million, primarily from our largest customer, partially offset by a decrease in commission revenue of 4.5 million. The increase in revenue from our home and renters insurance vertical was primarily due to an increase in carrier spend for referrals. The decrease in revenue from our other insurance verticals was due to a decrease in commission revenue of 10.3 million and a decrease in carrier spend for referrals of 6.5 million, both due primarily to our exit from the health insurance vertical.

Cost of revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense for technology assets that were fully depreciated in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as they were no longer going to be used. Decreases in personnel-related costs of 0.5 million primarily related to decreased headcount in our call center were fully offset by increases in third-party call center costs due to increased volume.

Personnel-related costs included stock-based compensation expense of 5.1 million and 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Technology services and agent license fees also decreased by 0.7 million and 0.6 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to our exit from the health insurance vertical and the reduction in personnel.

Personnel-related costs included stock-based compensation expense of 6.0 million and 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Restructuring and Other Charges 
 Restructuring and other charges of 19.8 million and 23.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, consisted of costs related to the Reduction Plan we implemented in June 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, restructuring and other charges primarily included the loss on the sale of health insurance vertical assets of 19.4 million and an asset impairment charge of 0.4 million for the right-of-use asset related to our Cambridge, Massachusetts office lease. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, restructuring costs and other charges also included net employee separation charges and non-cash compensation related to the restructuring of 3.8 million. 
 Acquisition-related 
 Acquisition-related costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.2 million consisted of the decrease in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities recorded as the result of our 2021 acquisition of PolicyFuel. We did not record any changes in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities in the three months ended September 30, 2023 or in either of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest income increased by 0.1 million and 0.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to an increase in interest earned on our cash balances. Other income (expense), net was not significant for any periods presented.

Income Tax Expense

We maintain a valuation allowance on our overall net deferred tax asset as it is deemed more likely than not the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of 82.8 million and up to 25.0 million of availability under our revolving line of credit pursuant to the 2023 Amended Loan Agreement (defined as the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 7, 2020 between us and Western Alliance Bank, as Lender, or the 2020 Loan Agreement, as amended by the Loan and Security Modification Agreement dated as of July 15, 2022, or the 2022 Loan Amendment, as amended by the Loan and Security Modification Agreement dated as of August 1, 2023, or the 2023 Consent and Release, as amended by the Loan and Security Modification Agreement, dated as of on August 7, 2023, or the 2023 Loan Amendment, as amended by the Loan and Security Modification Agreement, dated as of September 4, 2024). 
 Pursuant to the 2023 Amended Loan Agreement, borrowings under the revolving line of credit cannot exceed 85 of eligible accounts receivable balances, bear interest at the greater of 7.0 or the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal and mature on July 15, 2025. In an event of default, as defined in the 2023 Amended Loan Agreement, and until such event is no longer continuing, the annual interest rate to be charged would be the annual rate otherwise applicable to borrowings under the 2023 Amended Loan Agreement plus 5.00 . 
 Borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and property. Under the 2023 Amended Loan Agreement, we have agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants to which we will remain subject until maturity. The covenants include limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain fundamental business transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions of other businesses. In addition, under the 2023 Amended Loan Agreement and through the maturity date, we are required to maintain a minimum Adjusted Quick Ratio of 1.10 to 1.00 defined as the ratio of (1) the sum of (x) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held at the Lender plus (y) net accounts receivable reflected on our balance sheet to (2) current liabilities, including all borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Amended Loan Agreement, but excluding the current portion of deferred revenue (in each case determined in accordance with GAAP). At any time the Adjusted Quick Ratio is less than 1.30 to 1.00 the Lender shall have the ability to use our cash receipts to repay outstanding obligations until such time as the Adjusted Quick Ratio is equal to or greater than 1.30 to 1.00 for two consecutive months. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants and we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit.

Table of Contents 

Since our inception, we have incurred operating losses on an annual basis and may incur losses in the future. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, without considering the borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending on business initiatives, purchases of capital equipment to support our growth, sales and marketing activities, impact to our business from our restructuring, expansion of our business through acquisitions or our investments in complementary offerings, technologies or businesses, market acceptance of our platform and overall economic conditions. If we do not achieve our revenue goals as planned, we believe that we can reduce our operating costs. If we need additional funds and are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may need to significantly curtail our operations in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations, which could adversely affect our business prospects. 
 Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Operating activities provided 46.4 million in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulting from our net income of 19.9 million, net non-cash charges of 19.5 million and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets liabilities of 7.1 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a 30.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a 3.7 million decrease in commissions receivable, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 27.1 million. Operating activities used 2.0 million in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from our net loss of 44.9 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 1.3 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of 44.2 million, which included the loss on sale of health insurance vertical assets of 19.4 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a 13.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and commissions receivable of 7.3 million, 2.6 million and 2.6 million, respectively. 
 Changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities were generally due to changes in our business and timing of customer and vendor invoicing and payments. Collection of commissions receivable depends upon the timing of our receipt of commission payments from insurance carriers. A significant portion of our commissions receivable is classified as long-term. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to the acquisition of property and equipment, which included the capitalization of certain software development costs. Net cash provided by investing activities was 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of cash proceeds from the sale of Eversurance LLC of 13.2 million, partially offset by the acquisition of property and equipment of 3.0 million, which included the capitalization of certain software development costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we capitalized 2.2 million and 2.7 million, respectively, of software development costs. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 1.6 million and less than 0.1 million, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by tax withholding payments relating to net share settlements.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 In April 2024, we entered into two agreements to lease office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts through December 2027 for fixed payments totaling 3.2 million through 2027. In August 2024, we entered into an agreement to sublease office space in Belfast, Northern Ireland through July 2027 for fixed payments totaling approximately 1.6 million through 2027. There have been no other material changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For further disclosure, refer to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We have a credit agreement that provides us with credit at a floating rate of interest. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit and therefore no material exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. 
 We contract with vendors in foreign countries and we have foreign subsidiaries. As such, we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies associated with our foreign transactions and our foreign subsidiaries. We believe this exposure to be immaterial. We do not hedge against this exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates.

Item 4. Controls an d Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Notwithstanding, and in addition to, the foregoing, (i) at all times that any Advances are outstanding hereunder, Borrower shall maintain and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain 100 of its, and their, cash and cash equivalents in Borrower s and its Subsidiaries accounts with Bank, and (ii) at all times that no Advances are outstanding hereunder, Borrower shall maintain and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain not less than 80 of its, and their, cash and cash equivalents in Borrower s and its Subsidiaries accounts with Bank; provided, that, the foregoing limitations in clauses (i) and ii. shall not apply to any cash or cash equivalents of Borrower s Irish Subsidiary maintained in any account at or with any foreign bank or foreign financial institution other than Bank, for the purpose of paying foreign payroll obligations, and solely to the extent that all such other accounts (x) only maintain funds therein for a period not to exceed ten (10) days in any month, and (y) have less than 500,000 in the aggregate maintained therein at any time; provided, further, that, at all times that any Advances are outstanding hereunder and notwithstanding the foregoing clause (i) limitation, Borrower may also maintain its existing deposit accounts with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., so long as (1) the aggregate balance of the deposit accounts does not exceed Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars 25,000.00), and (2) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has executed and delivered a Control Agreement with respect to such domestic deposit account to perfect Bank s Lien in such account in accordance with the terms hereunder which Control Agreement may not be terminated without the prior written consent of Bank. 

B. Section 10 of the Loan and Security Agreement is hereby amended by amending and restating in its entirety the Borrower s notice address to read as follows: 

If to Borrower:	EverQuote, Inc. 
 141 Portland Street 
 Floor 7 
 Cambridge, MA 02139 
 Attn: Joseph Sanborn, CFO FAX: (617) 229-7007 
 3. CONSISTENT CHANGES . The Existing Documents are each hereby amended wherever necessary to reflect the changes described above. 

4. NO DEFENSES OF BORROWER/GENERAL RELEASE . Borrower agrees that, as of this date, they have no defenses against the obligations to pay any amounts under the Indebtedness. Borrower Releasing Party acknowledges that Bank would not enter into this Loan and Security Modification Agreement without Releasing Party s assurance that it has no claims against Bank or any of Bank s officers, directors, employees or agents. Except for the obligations arising hereafter under this Loan and Security Modification Agreement, the Loan and Security Agreement and the other Existing Documents, each Releasing Party releases Bank, and each of Bank s officers, directors and employees from any known or unknown claims that Releasing Party now has against Bank of any nature, including any claims that Releasing Party, its successors, counsel, and advisors may in the future discover they would have now had if they had known facts not now known to them, whether founded in contract, in tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, including but not limited to any claims arising out of or related to the Loan and Security Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Releasing Party waives the provisions of California Civil Code section 1542, which states: 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 The provisions, waivers and releases set forth in this section are binding upon each Releasing Party and its shareholders, agents, employees, assigns and successors in interest. The provisions, waivers and releases of this section shall inure to the benefit of Bank and its agents, employees, officers, directors, assigns and successors in interest. The provisions of this section shall survive payment in full of the Obligations, full performance of all the terms of this Loan and Security Modification Agreement and the other Existing Documents, and/or Bank s actions to exercise any remedy available under the Existing Documents or otherwise. 
 5. CONTINUING VALIDITY . Borrower understands and agrees that in modifying the existing Indebtedness, Bank is relying upon Borrower s representations, warranties, and agreements, as set forth in the Existing Documents. Borrower represents and warrants that the representations and warranties contained in the Loan and Security Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (or, with respect to representations and warranties modified by a materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard, in all respects) as of the date of this Loan and Security Modification Agreement (except for representations and warranties expressly referring to a specific date shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, with respect to representations and warranties modified by a materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard, in all respects) as of such date), and that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Except as expressly modified pursuant to this Loan and Security Modification Agreement, the terms of the Existing Documents remain unchanged and in full force and effect. Bank s agreement to modifications to the existing Indebtedness pursuant to this Loan and Security Modification Agreement in no way shall obligate Bank to make any future modifications to the Indebtedness. Nothing in this Loan and Security Modification Agreement shall constitute a satisfaction of the Indebtedness. It is the intention of Bank and Borrower to retain as liable parties all makers and endorsers of Existing Documents, unless the party is expressly released by Bank in writing. No maker, endorser, or guarantor will be released by virtue of this Loan and Security Modification Agreement. The terms of this paragraph apply not only to this Loan and Security Modification Agreement, but also to any subsequent loan and security modification agreements.
