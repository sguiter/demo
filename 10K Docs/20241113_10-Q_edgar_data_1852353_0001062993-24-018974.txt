DAKOTA GOLD CORP. 
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements 
 For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 (Unaudited) 

under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia, Canada). The Company focuses its business efforts on the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties in the United States of America ("U.S."). On May 22, 2020, the Company completed the domestication process and changed its registration from the Province of British Columbia, Canada to the State of Nevada. As a result of the DTRC Merger, Dakota Gold delivered shares of the Company's common stock to former holders of Dakota Territory common stock. On May 14, 2024, following the receipt of approval by its shareholders, the Company changed its state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware. The Company currently operates in one segment, mineral exploration in the United States. 
 Liquidity 
 The Company's mineral properties are at the exploration stage and are without declared mineral reserves or mineral resources, except for the mineral resource estimate contained in the Company's inaugural technical report summary for the Richmond Hill property, which was prepared in accordance with Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("S-K 1300"), and which was completed in April 2024. Therefore, our mineral properties have not generated revenues. The business of exploring for minerals involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines (see Risk Factors in the Company's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023). Major expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to develop metallurgical processes, to acquire construction and operating permits, and to construct mining and processing facilities. The amounts shown as mineral rights and properties represent acquisition and holding costs and do not necessarily represent present or future recoverable values. The recoverability of the amounts shown for mineral rights and properties is dependent upon the Company obtaining the necessary financing to complete the necessary exploration of the properties, the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, development of the properties and future profitable operations or through sale of the assets. 
 These Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 ("financial statements") have been prepared on the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries will continue as a going concern, meaning it will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. Different bases of measurement may be appropriate if the Company is not expected to continue operations for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not advanced its properties to commercial production and is not able to finance day-to-day activities through operations. 
 The Company's management believes its cash balance of approximately million as of September 30, 2024, the Company's working capital of approximately million, the anticipated ability to utilize the ATM program during the year and the ability to scale down the exploration program, if needed, alleviate doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months beyond the date of these financial statements. 

On June 26, 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement with certain entities managed by Orion Mine Finance ("Orion"), for an investment of approximately million in the Company. On July 2, 2024, Orion purchased shares of common stock of the Company at a price of per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million in a registered direct offering (the "Orion Equity Investment"). million. 

-owned subsidiaries: DTRC, LLC (incorporated in the U.S.), JR Resources (Canada) Services Corp. (incorporated in Canada), Dakota Gold Holdings LLC (incorporated in the U.S.) and Dakota Gold (Canada) Services Corp. (incorporated in Canada). All intercompany accounts and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

ownership of the interests in the Blind Gold, City Creek, Cambrian Unconformity, Tinton, West Corridor, Ragged Top, Poorman Anticline, Maitland, and South Lead / Whistler Gulch Properties. In addition, the Company has ownership in the Barrick Option and the Richmond Hill Properties upon exercise of their underlying option payments. All are located in the heart of the Homestake District. The individual claims, properties, options, and leases are aggregated into a single unit mining property, which we refer to as the "Black Hills Property. " 

On January 12, 2024 (the "closing date"), the Company closed an agreement to purchase various databases, mining permits and real properties in Lawrence County, South Dakota from VMC, LLC ("VMC") for total consideration of million, as well as a contingent payment of million upon the first of either of the following "triggering events: (i) the first commercial gold production or (ii) on a change of control, if the Company still owns the real property. The Company's total consideration to VMC is approximately million (the "balance payment") to be paid in two tranches: 
 1. On the closing date, one-half of the balance payment in shares of the Company's common stock based upon the volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") of the Company's shares for the 20-day period immediately prior to the closing date; and 
 2. On or before October 12, 2024 (the date that is nine months following the closing date) a payment of one-half of the balance payment in the Company's shares of common stock, cash or a combination of the Company's stock and cash, at the election of the Company. The value of any of the Company's stock will be based upon the VWAP of the stock for the 20-day period immediately prior to the date of issuance of the stock on or before nine months following the closing date. 
 The VWAP of the Company's shares of common stock for the 20-day period immediately prior to the initial closing date was per share. 
 On the closing date, the Company issued a total of shares of its common stock, valued at per share, the closing price of the Company's stock on the day before the closing date and paid closing costs of approximately million. The total capitalized value of consideration transferred for the first tranche was approximately million. 
 The second payment due in October 2024 of approximately million was capitalized at its present value of approximately million on January 12, 2024, which reflects a discount rate of . As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the second payment due was approximately million and is included as a deferred payment in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was approximately million and million, respectively. On October 11, 2024, the Company issued shares of common stock as payment in full. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company's mineral properties totaled approximately million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in the exploration stage and has not commenced amortization of its properties.

The Company qualifies all the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by the foregoing cautionary statements . This management's discussion and analysis ("MD A") should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and notes thereto as set forth herein and the Company's annual audited financial statements. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the Company, which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors that affect its business, including without limitation, the disclosures made under "Risk Factors" of its most recent Form 10-K. The Company's unaudited financial statements are stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As the Company is an exploration stage company as defined under S-K 1300 and has not generated revenues to date, its business is subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors beyond its control, including exploration and development risks, competition from well-funded competitors, and its ability to manage growth. Overview The Company's goal is to create stockholder value through the acquisition, responsible exploration, and future development of high caliber gold properties in the Homestake District of South Dakota. Management and the technical teams cumulatively have several hundred years of international mining and exploration experience and key personnel have more than 50 combined years in the Homestake District, mostly with the Homestake Mining Company, as well as other exploration companies that have operated in the region. The Company believes that this experience uniquely positions the Company and will allow it to leverage its direct experience and knowledge of past exploration and mining activities in the Homestake District. Combined with the use of modern exploration and mining techniques, and new geologic understanding from experience in other mines, new research and information extracted from its new geophysical surveys, the Company hopes to focus its programs and build upon where the historic Homestake Mining Company left off in the 1990s. The Homestake District has historically yielded approximately 44.8 million ounces of gold production as of September 30, 2024 with most of it coming from within a small geographic area. The production ledges of the Homestake Mine define a cumulative surface projection area of less than three square miles. Homestake Mining Company's historic gold production and exploration in the Homestake District was overwhelmingly focused on the underground mine. Modern statistical studies of ore deposit trends and understanding of the distribution of large gold camps around the world indicates that large gold deposits generally form in distinct camps and normally occur in clusters that show predictable distributions (Zipf's Law Applied to Ore Deposits). The Company believes this might be true for the Homestake District. Outside of the mine area, the Homestake District has been underexplored and heretofore has not been the subject of modern exploration efforts required to search for other deposits, especially under the cover of younger rocks that dominate the surface. The Company has consistently pursued a strategy of expanding its portfolio of brownfield properties located exclusively within the Homestake District to build a strong land position with the goal of consolidating possible mineral potential. Property acquisitions are focused and based on past exploration, the access to proprietary data sets the Company has assembled over the years, new research and remote data acquisition (Magnetics, Gravity and Radiometric) that was recently conducted over the Homestake District that hosts the Homestake Gold Deposit. Other than our mineral resource estimate with an effective date of October 5, 2023 contained in our inaugural technical report summary for the Richmond Hill property, none of our other properties are sufficiently drilled to prepare an estimate of mineral resources under S-K 1300. The Company believes the Homestake District is in a safe, low-cost jurisdiction with well-developed infrastructure and is in a favorable regulatory environment in which authorities have consistently demonstrated a willingness to work with responsible operators to permit well-planned compliant projects. Drill Programs and Results Permitting and site preparations were initiated for the first drilling program on the iron-formation target and other Tertiary-age replacement targets in the Maitland area and drilling commenced in early 2022. The Company has since expanded its drilling operations to the Richmond Hill Project and has had up to four drill rigs operating on Dakota Gold properties. Dakota Gold has completed permit applications and environmental field work for exploration on several target areas and currently has twelve active permits in place and with one further permit expecting approval in fourth quarter 2024. Of these thirteen permits, five are on the Maitland Project, six are on the Richmond Hill Project, one is on the City Creek Project and one is on the Cambrian Unconformity Project. Permitting targets for some of the other Dakota Gold Properties may be advanced for drilling as exploration activity continues throughout the year. In total, Dakota Gold has completed 188 drill holes for 360,829 feet (109,947 meters) since drilling started in 2022. The Company completed 24 holes for 78,339 feet (23,878 meters) of core drilling on three projects in 2022. The areas drilled were the Maitland Project (44,710 feet; 13,628 meters), the Richmond Hill Project (27,503 feet; 8,383 meters), and the Cambrian Unconformity Project (6,126 feet; 1,867 meters). The Company then completed 89 holes for 174,659 feet (53,236 meters) of core on two projects in 2023; the areas drilled were the Maitland Gold Project (78,589 feet; 23,954 meters) and the Richmond Hill Project (96,070 feet; 29,282 meters). The Company has also completed 73 holes for 108,130 feet (32,948 meters) of core on two projects during the first 3 quarters of 2024; the areas drilled were the Maitland Gold Project (84,185 feet; 25,652 meters) and the Richmond Hill Project (23,945 feet; 7,296 meters). On February 8, 2023, the Company announced the discovery of the Unionville Zone in MA22C-009, which intercepted mineralized, Precambrian hosted, Tertiary-age, epithermal gold mineralization in a structurally controlled breccia. On May 4, 2023, the Company announced the discovery of the JB Zone in MA23C-017, which intercepted significant high-grade, Homestake-type, Precambrian mineralization over potentially mineable widths that has since been followed up with multiple gold intercepts in multiple limbs of Homestake iron formation, the geometry of which is analogous to the West-Ledge system at the Homestake Mine. The Company continues to intersect both Homestake-type and Unionville Zone-type mineralization and released drilling and assay results in press releases on May 23, 2024, June 20, 2024, July 9, 2024, and August 22, 2024. On April 13, 2023, the Company announced the commencement of an infill and step-out drilling program at the Richmond Hill property to convert and expand known gold mineralization identified by more than 900 historical drill holes, and expanded by new Dakota Gold drilling, into the maiden technical report summary for the Richmond Hill property. On September 27, 2023, the Company announced commencement of an infill drilling program at the Unionville Zone on the Maitland Project for the purpose of advancing to a S-K 1300 compliant mineral resource estimate in the future. Richmond Hill Technical Resource Estimate On April 30, 2024, the Company announced the completion of the inaugural S-K 1300 compliant technical report summary for the Richmond Hill property, which was filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K on April 30, 2024. This report does not include the infill drilling program at the Unionville Zone on the Maitland Project. Planned Activities The Company's planned activities in fiscal 2024 will be focused on advancing exploration and resources development drilling on its Maitland and Richmond Hill projects. Additional field work, specifically data compilation, sampling and mapping are planned for Dakota Gold's West Corridor, Blind Gold and Poorman Anticline properties during the balance of 2024. Specifically at Richmond Hill, gold mineralization remains open in all directions and at depth. Additional drilling will be conducted within the resource area, defined in the inaugural resource estimation, where significant mineral potential exists but where drilling was of insufficient density to be included in the initial mineral resource estimate. The additional drilling and the inclusion of silver will be incorporated into future resource estimates. In addition, future exploration will be conducted on targets outside the Richmond Hill resource area where untested targets exist or where potential mineralized structures and breccias project under Paleozoic and Tertiary cover rocks. Also at Richmond Hill, work will continue on understanding the rare earth mineralization announced on January 31, 2024 through additional assay and metallurgical investigation and a preliminary geologic model. At Maitland, infill and step out drilling will continue in the JB and Unionville discovery areas for both Precambrian and Tertiary-age gold mineralization with the goal of completing initial mineral resource estimations for these systems in the future. The Company continues to utilize its proprietary geophysical data sets to evaluate both regional and project specific targets. The Company continues to locate and compile historic data sets useful to the Company's regional exploration programs and has initiated field programs on several of its properties outside of Maitland and Richmond Hill areas in hopes of defining additional drill targets for future exploration programs. Additional land acquisition will be pursued on an opportunistic basis to enhance the Company's ongoing exploration efforts. The Company's projects are all in the exploration stage and do not generate revenues. Other than the mineral resource estimate contained in the technical report summary for the Richmond Hill property, the Company has not established that any of its properties or projects contain mineral resources or mineral reserves, as defined under S-K 1300. Expenditure projections are subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors beyond the Company's control, including exploration and development risks, competition from well-funded competitors, and the Company's ability to manage growth and assessments of ongoing exploration activities and results. The Company cannot offer assurance that its budgeted expenses will fall within its projections. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company is in the exploration stage and currently does not generate revenue. As such, the Company finances its operations and the acquisition and exploration of its mineral properties through the issuance of common stock, and the Company could be materially adversely affected if it is unable to raise capital because of market or other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of approximately 8.35 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 70.51 million. The Company had a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of approximately 27.84 million. On June 26, 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement with certain entities managed by Orion Mine Finance ("Orion"), for an investment of approximately 5.86 million in the Company. On July 2, 2024, Orion purchased 2,344,836 shares of common stock of the Company at a price of 2.50 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 5.71 million in a registered direct offering (the "Orion Equity Investment"). Concurrent with the consummation of the Orion Equity Investment, the Company sold to Orion a 1 net smelter return royalty interest on certain properties held by the Company for total consideration of approximately 0.18 million. During the twelve months ending December 31, 2024, the Company anticipates cash expenditures of approximately 34 million, including approximately 24.45 million that has already been incurred through September 30, 2024. Based on the Company's cash balance at September 30, 2024 of approximately 14.70 million and the anticipated ability to utilize the ATM program during the year, the Company believes that it will have sufficient funds to fund its activities for the next twelve months. The actual timing of expected expenditures and fundraising is dependent upon several factors, including the management of variable exploration expenditures. Should it be unable to raise sufficient capital, the Company plans to scale down the exploration program to maintain sufficient funds through September 30, 2025. Results of Operations Comparison of Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The Company had losses from operations for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaling approximately 10.23 million and 8.86 million, respectively, losses before income tax of approximately 10.11 million and 8.80 million respectively, leading to net losses of approximately 10.09 million and 8.54 million, respectively. Exploration Expenses During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, exploration expenses totaled approximately 7.80 million and 6.94 million, respectively. The Company's main driver for exploration expenditure relates to the number of drills operating at our projects. While the Company alternated between three and four drills operating during both periods, the Company averaged more drills on site in the third quarter of 2024 than in the same quarter of 2023. In addition, the Company used a specialist directional drilling company in 2024 which further increased costs. Included in exploration costs were non-cash exploration-related stock-based compensation expenses of approximately 0.16 million for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were approximately 2.43 million and 1.92 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily for legal, accounting, professional fees, investor relations, and other general and administrative expenses necessary for our operations. The increase was primarily due to increased support costs included in general and administrative costs of approximately 1.06 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (compared to 0.84 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023), investor relations expenses of approximately 0.13 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (compared to approximately 0.03 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023) as the Company increased investor related activities to support the capital raising through the ATM and the Orion financing, professional fees of approximately 0.22 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (compared to 0.18 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023), stock-based compensation allocated to administration expenses of 0.92 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (compared to approximately 0.74 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023) and consulting fees of 0.04 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (compared to approximately 0.01 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023). Other Income and Expense The Company earned interest income from bank accounts of approximately 0.17 million and 0.07 million and incurred interest expense of approximately 0.06 million and nil related to the VMC purchase and the sale of the royalty for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The Company had losses from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaling approximately 28.25 million and 28.61 million, respectively, losses before income tax of approximately 27.88 million and 28.48 million respectively, leading to net losses of approximately 27.84 million and 27.63 million, respectively. Exploration Expenses During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, exploration expenses totaled approximately 20.78 million and 21.38 million, respectively. The Company's main driver for exploration expenditure relates to the number of drills operating at our projects. While the Company alternated between three and four drills in operation during both periods, the Company averaged fewer drills in 2024 and the Company has improved cost efficiency which has reduced the overall costs. The Company also took a longer break from drilling during January 2024 in comparison to 2023, which reduced drilling and related costs including assays and core cutting. Partially offsetting the reduction in drilling costs were higher study costs relating to the completion of the technical report summary for the Richmond Hill property and higher costs as a result of having a specialist company supporting the directional drilling. Included in exploration costs were non-cash exploration-related stock-based compensation expenses of approximately 0.47 million and 0.57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were approximately 7.47 million and 7.23 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily for legal, accounting, professional fees, investor relations, and other general and administrative expenses necessary for our operations. The increase was primarily due to investor relations expenses of approximately 0.67 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (compared to approximately 0.11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023) as the Company increased investor related activities to support the capital raising through the ATM and Orion financing, professional fees of approximately 0.59 million (compared to approximately 0.43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023) and consulting fees of approximately 0.08 million (compared to 0.06 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023), partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation allocated to administration expenses of 2.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (compared to approximately 2.88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023) and support costs included in general and administrative costs of approximately 3.54 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (compared to 3.52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). Other Income and Expense The Company earned interest income from bank accounts of approximately 0.52 million and 0.16 million and incurred interest expense of approximately 0.14 million and nil mainly related to the VMC purchase and the sale of the royalty for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's cash flows used in operating activities were approximately 23.88 million and 25.30 million, respectively. Cash used in operations decreased period over period mainly as a result of the decrease in drilling expenditures between the two periods. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash flow used in investing activities were approximately 0.57 million and 1.12 million, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities consisted of approximately 0.14 million for purchases of property and equipment and 0.43 million for purchase of mineral properties. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the cash used in investing activities consisted of approximately 0.71 million for purchases of mineral properties and 0.41 million for purchases of property and equipment. The decrease in property acquisition costs was due to the timing of acquisitions and the use of shares instead of cash for the purchase of the VMC property during the period and the higher acquisition of property and equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the completion of the Company's new core storage facility. Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash from financing activities totaled approximately 13.60 million, as the Company issued 3,433,057 shares of common stock under the ATM program for net proceeds of approximately 7.67 million, 2,344,836 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 5.71 million pursuant to the Orion Equity Investment and 20,000 shares of common stock for the exercise of stock options for proceeds of approximately 0.04 million and sold to Orion a 1 net smelter return royalty interest on certain properties held by the Company for total consideration of approximately 0.18 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash from financing activities totaled approximately 15.27 million, as the Company issued 5,470,564 shares of common stock under the ATM program for net proceeds of approximately 15.44 million, issued 68,750 shares of common stock for the exercise of stock options for proceeds of approximately 0.07 million, issued 9,018 shares of common stock for the exercise of share purchase warrants for proceeds of approximately 0.02 million and paid income taxes related to RSU and PSU share issuances totaling approximately 0.26 million on behalf of its employees. Critical Accounting Estimates This MD A of financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that the Company's consolidated financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from the Company's assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements; valuation of options granted to directors and officers using Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models. The Company's accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to the Company's audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates described in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures At the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company's management, including its chief executive officer ("CEO") and chief financial officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes to Internal Controls and Procedures over Financial Reporting Management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, concluded that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. None. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities.
