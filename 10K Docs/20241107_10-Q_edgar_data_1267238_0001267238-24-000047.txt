 million and million for Global Lifestyle and million and million for Global Housing for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The disaggregated revenues from service contracts included in fees and other income on the consolidated statements of operations are billion and million for Global Lifestyle and million and million for Global Housing for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Global Lifestyle 
 In the Global Lifestyle segment, revenues from service contracts and sales of products are primarily from the Connected Living business. Through partnerships with mobile carriers, the Company provides administrative services related to its mobile device protection products, including program design and marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, supply chain and service delivery, repair and logistics, and device disposition. Administrative fees are generally billed monthly based on the volume of services provided during the billing period (for example, based on the number of mobile subscribers) with payment due within a short-term period. Each service or bundle of services, depending on the contract, is an individual performance obligation with a standalone selling price. The Company recognizes revenue as it invoices, which corresponds to the value transferred to the customer. 
 The Company also repairs, refurbishes and then sells mobile and other electronic devices, on behalf of its clients, for a bundled per unit fee. The entire processing of the device is considered one performance obligation with a standalone selling price and thus, the per unit fee is recognized when the products are sold. Payments are generally due prior to shipment or within a short-term period. 
 Global Housing 
 In the Global Housing segment, revenues from service contracts and sales of products are primarily from the Homeowners business. As part of the Homeowners business, the Company provides loan and claim payment tracking services for lenders. The Company generally invoices its customers weekly or monthly based on the volume of services provided during the billing period with payment due within a short-term period. Each service is an individual performance obligation with a standalone selling price. The Company recognizes revenue as it invoices, which corresponds to the value transferred to the customer. 
 Contract Balances 
 The receivables and unearned revenue under these contracts were million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. These balances are

For these contracts, expense is recognized as revenues are earned. The Company periodically assesses recoverability based on the performance of the related contracts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately million and million, respectively, of such intangible assets attributed to service contracts that will be expensed over the term of the client contracts.

of the outstanding principal balance of commercial mortgage loans was concentrated in the states of California, Texas and Maryland. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, an economic downturn could have an adverse impact on the ability of its debtors to repay their loans. The outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans range in size from less than million to million as of September 30, 2024, and from less than million to million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Credit quality indicators for commercial mortgage loans are loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios. The loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property s annual net operating income to its annual debt-service payments and is commonly expressed as a ratio. The loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios are generally updated annually in the fourth quarter.

 Global Lifestyle contributed million and million in net favorable loss development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net favorable loss development in both periods was attributable to nearly all lines of business in Global Lifestyle across most of the Company s regions with a concentration on more recent accident years and based on emerging evaluations regarding loss experience. Connected Living contributed million of net favorable development, of which million was from extended service contracts, million from credit and other insurance and million from mobile. For extended service contracts, improvements in data quality for certain clients allowed for reserve releases and contributed to the favorable development. The favorable development for credit and other insurance was primarily from Canada and Europe through the release of reserves associated with older claims. Frequency improvements in Europe and reserve releases on older claims in Brazil contributed to the favorable development in mobile. Global Automotive contributed million of net unfavorable development driven by higher claim frequencies as more vehicles meet the loss criteria in an asset protection product. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the favorable development was also primarily from Connected Living and due to similar drivers. Many of these contracts and products contain retrospective commission (profit sharing) provisions that would result in offsetting increases or decreases in expense dependent on if the development was favorable or unfavorable.

million and million of net favorable loss development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net favorable loss development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of favorable non-catastrophe development of million and million from net favorable development from prior catastrophe events. The favorable non-catastrophe development was driven by million from lender-placed hazard primarily in accident year 2023 due to favorable frequency, easing inflation and legislative reform changes in Florida. The net favorable loss development for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to favorable frequency and severity trends from lower than anticipated inflation, partially offset by unfavorable development on Winter Storm Elliott as a result of higher severity than initially projected. 
 The sharing economy and small commercial businesses, reported within non-core operations, contributed million and million in net unfavorable loss development during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The million in net unfavorable loss development was primarily attributable to sharing economy, driven by more newly reported claims than expected and an increase in the portion and amount of claims anticipated to exceed the per policy deductible. The net unfavorable loss development for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable primarily to reserve assumption increases in sharing economy related to higher frequency expectations for the number of claims closed with indemnity payment. 
 All others contributed million and million of net favorable loss development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. 
 Long-Duration Contracts 
 The Company adopted the targeted improvements accounting guidance for long-duration insurance contracts as of January 1, 2023, using a modified retrospective method on liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses to January 1, 2021 for long-term care insurance contracts that have been fully reinsured. The Company also elected to not apply the amended accounting guidance to long-duration contracts of legal entities sold and derecognized before the January 1, 2023 effective date as the Company has no significant continuing involvement with them. 
 A remeasurement of the ending reporting period future policy benefits and expenses reserve is calculated using the current upper medium grade fixed-income corporate bond instrument yield as of the consolidated balance sheet ending period (the current discount rate ). The current discount rate used is an externally published US corporate A index weighted average spot rate that is updated quarterly and effectively matches the duration of the expected cash flow streams of the long-term care reserves. The difference between the ending period future policy benefits and expenses reserve measured using the original discount rate and the future policy benefits and expenses reserve measured using the current discount rate is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI in the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 The long-term care insurance contracts are fully reinsured and there is no impact to consolidated stockholders equity or net income as the reserves are fully reinsured.

 Segment Information 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had two reportable operating segments which are defined based on the manner in which the Company s chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), reviews the business to assess performance and allocate resources, and which align to the nature of the products and services offered: 
 Global Lifestyle: includes mobile device solutions (including extended service contracts, insurance policies and related services), extended service contracts and related services for consumer electronics and appliances, and credit and other insurance products (referred to as Connected Living and vehicle protection services, commercial equipment services and other related services (referred to as Global Automotive and 
 Global Housing: includes lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance, as well as voluntary manufactured housing, condominium and homeowners insurance (referred to as Homeowners and renters insurance and other products (referred to as Renters and Other ). 
 In addition, we report the Corporate and Other segment, which includes corporate employee-related expenses and activities of the holding company. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA, our segment measure of profitability, as net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities, non-core operations (which consists of certain businesses which we have fully exited or expect to fully exit, including the long-tail commercial liability businesses (sharing economy and small commercial businesses), certain legacy long-duration insurance policies and our operations in mainland China (not Hong Kong)), restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities (outside of normal periodic restructuring and cost management 
 34 

activities), Assurant Health runoff operations, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, as well as other highly variable or unusual items. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 Consolidated net income decreased 56.3 million, or 30 , to 133.8 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 190.1 million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily due to higher reportable catastrophes within Global Housing. This was partially offset by higher top-line growth in Homeowners within Global Housing. 
 Global Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.5 million, or 4 , to 184.3 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 191.8 million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and modestly lower results within Global Automotive, where elevated losses within select ancillary products were partially offset by higher investment income. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Connected Living was flat as investments in new client programs and capabilities to support future growth were offset by growth in mobile device protection programs from increased subscribers, particularly in the U.S. 
 Global Lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 143.7 million, or 7 , to 2.25 billion for Third Quarter 2024 from 2.11 billion for Third Quarter 2023, primarily driven by Connected Living from mobile growth, including contributions from newly launched trade-in programs and global device protection programs. 
 Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA decreased 72.7 million, or 44 , to 92.4 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 165.1 million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily due to 110.6 million of higher pre-tax reportable catastrophes. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA increased 37.9 million, or 20 , primarily from continued top-line growth within Homeowners, including higher policies in-force from new lender-placed programs and portfolios and increased voluntary insurance market pressure, and 30.1 million of favorable year-over-year prior period reserve development. The increase was partially offset by a 27.5 million non-run rate adjustment related to a change in earnings pattern assumptions. 
 Global Housing net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 48.6 million, or 9 , to 603.8 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 555.2 million for Third Quarter 2023, mainly driven by Homeowners top-line growth, including growth in policies in-force and higher average premiums within lender-placed insurance as well as growth across various specialty products, partially offset by the non-run rate adjustment mentioned above. 
 Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA was (29.8) million for Third Quarter 2024 compared to (26.2) million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily driven by higher third-party and employee-related expenses. 
 In fourth quarter 2024, Hurricane Milton is expected to be a reportable catastrophe event with losses in the range of 75.0 million to 110.0 million pre-tax. There is inherent variability in estimates of early loss projections and claims severity, particularly in high-damage regions, and therefore, the estimate may change as additional information emerges. For more information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Critical Factors Affecting Results 
 Our results depend on, among other things, the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting, the accuracy of our reserving methodology for future policyholder benefits and claims, the frequency and severity of reportable and non-reportable catastrophes, returns on and values of invested assets, our investment income, and our ability to realize greater operational efficiencies and manage our expenses. Our results also depend on our ability to profitably grow our businesses, including our Connected Living and Global Automotive businesses, and the performance of our Homeowners business. Factors affecting these items, including conditions in the financial markets, the global economy, political conditions and the markets in which we operate, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation, including the current period of inflationary pressures which have impacted claims costs primarily in the Homeowners and the Global Automotive businesses, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For more information on these and other factors that could affect our results, see Item 1A Risk Factors below and in our 2023 Annual Report, and Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Factors Affecting Results in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Our results may be impacted by our ability to continue to grow in the markets in which we operate, which will be impacted by our ability to provide a superior digital-first customer experience, including from our investments in technology and digital initiatives, capitalize on the connected home opportunity and investments to onboard and ramp-up new business. Our mobile business is subject to volatility in mobile device trade-in volumes and margins based on the actual and anticipated timing of the release of new devices, carrier promotional programs and sales prices for used devices, as well as to changes in consumer preferences. Our Homeowners revenues are impacted by changes in the housing and voluntary insurance markets. In addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to competitive pressures, including the threat of disruption and competition for talent, which has increased due to labor shortages and wage inflation. See Item 1A Risk Factors Business, Strategic and Operational Risks Significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could

adversely affect our results of operations , Our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices, and to regulatory compliance and other risks and The success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce in our 2023 Annual Report.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income decreased 56.3 million, or 30 , to 133.8 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 190.1 million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily due to 88.3 million of higher after-tax reportable catastrophes and 10.3 million of higher after-tax depreciation expense mainly related to the previously disclosed implementation of the integrated global financial systems and infrastructure and other internally developed software. The decrease in net income was partially offset by higher Global Housing earnings, excluding the impact of reportable catastrophes, and 11.3 million of lower after-tax restructuring costs (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report). 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income increased 98.9 million, or 22 , to 558.9 million for Nine Months 2024 from 460.0 million for Nine Months 2023, primarily driven by higher earnings in Global Housing, excluding the impact of reportable catastrophes, 24.4 million of lower after-tax losses from our non-core operations, mainly from sharing economy, a lower annualized effective tax rate, mainly due to transferable tax credits and a favorable mix of foreign business, and a 21.1 million favorable change in after-tax foreign exchange related gains (losses) (including gains (losses) from foreign exchange transactions and derivatives and from the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Argentina). The increase in net income was partially offset by 84.3 million of higher after-tax reportable catastrophes and 17.3 million of higher after-tax depreciation expense, as described above.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.5 million, or 4 , to 184.3 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 191.8 million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily driven by ongoing elevated losses within select ancillary products in Global Automotive, higher expenses for investments in new client programs and capabilities in Connected Living and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The decrease was partially offset by higher net investment income and growth from mobile device protection programs in Connected Living from increased subscribers, particularly in the U.S. 
 Total revenues increased 146.0 million, or 7 , to 2.34 billion for Third Quarter 2024 from 2.19 billion for Third Quarter 2023. Fees and other income increased 114.6 million, or 41 , primarily due to contributions from newly launched mobile trade-in programs. Net earned premiums increased 29.1 million, or 2 , primarily driven by Connected Living growth from global mobile device protection programs, partially offset by a decline in U.S. extended service contracts and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Net investment income increased 2.3 million, or 3 , primarily due to higher yields and asset balances in fixed maturity securities, partially offset by lower cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 153.5 million, or 8 , to 2.15 billion for Third Quarter 2024 from 2.00 billion for Third Quarter 2023. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 127.1 million, or 8 , primarily due to an increase in Connected Living expenses, mainly from higher cost of sales from newly launched mobile trade-in programs and higher commission expenses due to growth from global mobile device protection programs, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower commission expenses for Global Automotive and U.S. extended service contracts in Connected Living. Policyholder benefits increased 26.4 million, or 6 , primarily due to ongoing elevated claims costs in Global Automotive, as described above, and an increase in global mobile device protection subscribers in Connected Living, partially offset by lower losses for extended service contracts in line with the decrease in net earned premiums. 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.0 million to 581.7 million for Nine Months 2024 from 587.7 million for Nine Months 2023, primarily due to ongoing elevated claims costs in Global Automotive, mainly from elevated losses in select ancillary products, as well as higher labor and parts costs due to inflation, higher expenses for investments in new client programs and

capabilities in Connected Living and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by higher net investment income, as well as higher U.S. financial services profitability and growth in domestic mobile device protection programs in Connected Living. 
 Total revenues increased 386.4 million, or 6 , to 6.89 billion for Nine Months 2024 from 6.50 billion for Nine Months 2023. Fees and other income increased 269.2 million, or 34 , primarily due to contributions from newly launched mobile trade-in programs. Net earned premiums increased 96.6 million, or 2 , primarily driven by growth from global mobile device protection programs in Connected Living and from prior period sales in Global Automotive, partially offset by a decline in U.S. extended service contracts in Connected Living and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Net investment income increased 20.6 million, or 8 , primarily due to higher yields and asset balances in fixed maturity securities. 
 Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 392.4 million, or 7 , to 6.30 billion for Nine Months 2024 from 5.91 billion for Nine Months 2023. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 309.8 million, or 7 , primarily due to an increase in Connected Living expenses, mainly from higher cost of sales from newly launched mobile trade-in programs and higher commission expenses due to growth from global mobile device protection programs, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower commission expenses for U.S. extended service contracts in Connected Living and Global Automotive. Policyholder benefits increased 82.6 million, or 7 , primarily due to ongoing elevated claims costs in Global Automotive, as described above, and from higher claims in the global mobile device protection business in Connected Living, partially offset by lower losses for extended service contracts in Connected Living in line with the decrease in net earned premiums.

 The table below presents information regarding the Global Housing segment s results of operations for the periods indicated: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues Net earned premiums 557.0 521.9 1,678.0 1,501.4 Fees and other income 46.8 33.3 131.6 95.7 Net investment income 31.7 29.6 90.1 76.0 Total revenues 635.5 584.8 1,899.7 1,673.1 Benefits, losses and expenses Policyholder benefits 323.3 218.7 803.5 685.4 Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses 219.8 201.0 650.4 599.6 Total benefits, losses and expenses 543.1 419.7 1,453.9 1,285.0 Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA 92.4 165.1 445.8 388.1 Impact of reportable catastrophes 136.8 26.2 195.2 89.1 Net earned premiums, fees and other income Homeowners 478.4 434.1 1,438.5 1,237.8 Renters and Other 125.4 121.1 371.1 359.3 Total 603.8 555.2 1,809.6 1,597.1 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 72.7 million, or 44 , to 92.4 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 165.1 million for Third Quarter 2023, mainly due to 110.6 million of higher pre-tax reportable catastrophes and a 27.5 million non-run rate adjustment related to a change in earnings pattern assumptions. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by continued growth within Homeowners, primarily from higher policies in-force from new lender-placed programs and portfolios and increased voluntary insurance market pressure, higher premium rates and average insured values, and 30.1 million of favorable year-over-year non-catastrophe prior period reserve development. Third Quarter 2024 had 44.7 million of favorable non-catastrophe prior period reserve development compared to 14.6 million in Third Quarter 2023. 
 Total revenues increased 50.7 million, or 9 , to 635.5 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 584.8 million for Third Quarter 2023. Net earned premiums increased 35.1 million, or 7 , primarily driven by Homeowners from higher lender-placed policies in-force, premium rates and average insured values as described above and growth across various specialty products, partially offset by a non-run rate adjustment described above. Fees and other income increased 13.5 million, or 41 , driven by reclassification of certain service fees to fee income from an expense account. Net investment income increased 2.1 million, or 7 , primarily due to higher yields and asset balances in fixed maturity securities. 
 Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 123.4 million, or 29 , to 543.1 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 419.7 million for Third Quarter 2023. Policyholder benefits increased 104.6 million, or 48 , primarily due to higher reportable catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe losses from favorable year-over-year prior period reserve development. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18.8 million, or 9 , primarily due to the reclassification described above, as well as higher costs associated with growth. 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 57.7 million, or 15 , to 445.8 million for Nine Months 2024 from 388.1 million for Nine Months 2023, mainly due to continued growth from higher policies in-force, average insured values and rates within Homeowners and 44.7 million of favorable year-over-year net impact to non-catastrophe prior year reserve development. Nine Months 2024 had 85.1 million of favorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve development compared to 40.4 million in Nine Months 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was also driven by ongoing expense leverage from scale and operating 
 40 

efficiencies and higher net investment income. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by 106.1 million of higher reportable catastrophes and a 27.5 million non-run rate adjustment related to a change in earnings pattern assumptions. 
 Total revenues increased 226.6 million, or 14 , to 1.90 billion for Nine Months 2024 from 1.67 billion for Nine Months 2023. Net earned premiums increased 176.6 million, or 12 , primarily driven by Homeowners from higher lender-placed policies in-force and average insured values, as well as higher premium rates and growth across various specialty products, partially offset by the non-run rate adjustment described above and exits from certain international markets. Fees and other income increased 35.9 million, or 38 , mainly driven by the reclassification described above. Net investment income increased 14.1 million, or 19 , primarily due to higher yields and asset balances on fixed maturity securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 168.9 million, or 13 , to 1.45 billion for Nine Months 2024 from 1.29 billion for Nine Months 2023. Policyholder benefits increased 118.1 million, or 17 , primarily due to higher reportable catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe losses from exposure growth, partially offset by the favorable year-over-year non-catastrophe prior year reserve development. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 50.8 million, or 8 , primarily due to the reclassification described above and higher costs associated with growth.

Corporate and Other 
 The tables below present information regarding the Corporate and Other s segment results of operations for the periods indicated: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues Net earned premiums Fees and other income 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.2 Net investment income 7.8 7.3 20.5 15.6 Total revenues 7.9 7.4 20.9 15.8 Benefits, losses and expenses Policyholder benefits 0.1 General and administrative expenses 37.7 33.6 107.4 94.8 Total benefits, losses and expenses 37.7 33.6 107.4 94.9 Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (29.8) (26.2) (86.5) (79.1) 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted EBITDA was (29.8) million for Third Quarter 2024 compared to (26.2) million for Third Quarter 2023. The change in results was primarily due to higher third-party consulting expenses to support enterprise growth initiatives and higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net investment income from higher asset balances in fixed maturity securities. 
 Total revenues increased 0.5 million, or 7 , to 7.9 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 7.4 million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily driven by an increase in net investment income of 0.5 million, or 7 , mostly due to higher asset balances in fixed maturity securities. 
 Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 4.1 million, or 12 , to 37.7 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 33.6 million for Third Quarter 2023, primarily driven by higher third-party consulting expenses to support enterprise growth initiatives and higher employee-related expenses. 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted EBITDA was (86.5) million for Nine Months 2024 compared to (79.1) million for Nine Months 2023. The change in results was primarily due to higher third-party consulting expenses to support enterprise growth initiatives and higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net investment income. 
 Total revenues increased 5.1 million, or 32 , to 20.9 million for Nine Months 2024 from 15.8 million for Nine Months 2023, primarily driven by an increase in net investment income of 4.9 million, or 31 , mostly due to higher yields and asset balances in fixed maturity securities. 
 Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 12.5 million, or 13 , to 107.4 million for Nine Months 2024 from 94.9 million for Nine Months 2023, primarily driven by higher third-party consulting expenses to support enterprise growth initiatives and higher employee-related expenses.

Investments 
 We had total investments of 8.97 billion and 8.22 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net unrealized losses on our fixed maturity securities portfolio decreased by 210.0 million during Nine Months 2024, from 380.3 million as of December 31, 2023 to a net unrealized loss of 170.3 million as of September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in Treasury yields. 
 The following table shows the credit quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio as of the dates indicated: 
 Fair value as of Fixed Maturity Securities by Credit Quality September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Aaa / Aa / A 4,274.7 56.3 3,958.7 57.3 Baa 2,817.8 37.1 2,564.8 37.1 Ba 422.8 5.6 318.6 4.6 B and lower 80.8 1.0 70.0 1.0 Total 7,596.1 100.0 6,912.1 100.0 
 The following table shows the major categories of net investment income for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Fixed maturity securities 99.2 86.2 285.9 245.8 Equity securities 3.3 4.0 10.1 11.6 Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 4.8 4.5 14.5 12.9 Short-term investments 4.3 4.8 13.5 10.9 Other investments 2.1 7.0 11.5 15.2 Cash and cash equivalents 19.7 23.5 58.0 59.7 Total investment income 133.4 130.0 393.5 356.1 Investment expenses (3.7) (4.5) (12.4) (12.5) Net investment income 129.7 125.5 381.1 343.6 
 Net investment income increased 4.2 million, or 3 , to 129.7 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 125.5 million for Third Quarter 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher yields and asset balances in fixed maturity securities. 
 Net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities decreased 0.8 million, or 4 , to 18.3 million for Third Quarter 2024 from 19.1 million for Third Quarter 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by realized gains from changes in fair value of equity securities, which was partially offset by realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities. 
 
 Net investment income increased 37.5 million, or 11 , to 381.1 million for Nine Months 2024 from 343.6 million for Nine Months 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher yields and asset balances in fixed maturity securities. 
 Net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities decreased 3.0 million, or 6 , to 46.7 million for Nine Months 2024 from 49.7 million for Nine Months 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by unrealized gains from changes in fair value of equity securities and realized gains on sales of equity securities, which was partially offset by realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 17.4 million of securities guaranteed by financial guarantee insurance companies. Included in this a mount was 15.8 million of municipal securities, whose credit rating was A+ with the guarantee, but would have had a rating AA- without the guarantee. 
 For more information on our investments, see Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 
 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program 
 We consolidated our main reinsurance purchases into a single placement date of April 2024. Coverage was placed with more than 40 reinsurers that are all rated A- or better by A.M. Best. 2024 reinsurance premiums for the total program are estimated to be 191.4 million pre-tax, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 207.2 million pre-tax for 2023, reflecting impacts from changing the timing of program placement in this initial year of transition to a single placement date, as well as favorable underlying rates from improved reinsurance market conditions. Actual reinsurance premiums will vary if exposure changes significantly from estimates or if reinstatement premiums are required due to catastrophe events. 
 43 

The U.S. per-occurrence catastrophe coverage includes a main reinsurance program providing 1.48 billion of coverage in excess of a 150.0 million retention for a first event. Layers 1 through 7 of the program allow for one automatic reinstatement. When combined with the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, the U.S. program protects against gross Florida losses of up to approximately 1.69 billion, in excess of retention. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our needs over the next twelve months, including the ability to pay interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock. 
 We are in the process of negotiating an agreement to sell our Miami, Florida property to a potential buyer. If the transaction is consummated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we expect to record a gain above the current carrying value of 46.0 million as of September 30, 2024. We do not anticipate that any such gain will impact our capital deployment priorities. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that a transaction will be approved or consummated. 
 Regulatory Requirements 
 Assurant, Inc. is a holding company and, as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries ability to pay such dividends and make such other payments is regulated by the states and territories in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. These dividend regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary, but generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. See Item 1 Business Regulation U.S. Insurance Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks Changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth in our 2023 Annual Report. Along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in determining the amount of capital used for dividends from insurance subsidiaries is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from A.M. Best Company A.M. Best ). For the year ending December 31, 2024, the maximum amount of dividends our regulated U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us, under applicable laws and regulations currently in effect and without prior regulatory approval, is approximately 592.4 million. In addition, our international and non-insurance subsidiaries provide additional sources of dividends. 
 Regulators or rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries or the enterprise. For further information on our ratings and the risks of ratings downgrades, see Item 1 Business Ratings and Item 1A Risk Factors Financial Risks A decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Holding Company 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 636.2 million in holding company liquidity, which was 411.2 million above our targeted minimum level of 225.0 million. The target minimum level of holding company liquidity, which can be used for unforeseen capital needs at our subsidiaries or liquidity needs at the holding company, is calibrated based on approximately one year of corporate operating losses and interest expenses. We use the term holding company liquidity to represent the portion of cash and other liquid marketable securities held at Assurant, Inc. (out of a total of 723.6 million as of September 30, 2024) which we are not otherwise holding for a specific purpose as of the balance sheet date. We can use such assets for stockholder dividends, stock repurchases, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Dividends or returns of capital paid by our subsidiaries to the holding company, net of infusions of liquid assets and excluding amounts used for or as a result of acquisitions or received from dispositions, were 556.4 million and 772.6 million for Nine Months 2024 and Twelve Months 2023, respectively. We use these cash inflows primarily to pay holding company operating expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our common stockholders, to repurchase our common stock and to fund investments and acquisitions. From time to time, we may also seek to purchase outstanding debt in open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions. 
 Dividends and Repurchases 
 During Nine Months 2024, we made common stock repurchases and paid common stock dividends of 294.8 million. We paid dividends of 0.72 per common share on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record as of September 3, 2024. Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors (the Board and will be dependent upon various factors, including: our subsidiaries payments of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial condition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth 
 44 

prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors the Board deems relevant. The Credit Facility (as defined below) also contains limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and repurchase capital stock if we are in default, or such dividend payments or repurchases would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. In addition, if we elect to defer the payment of interest on our 7.00 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 2048 or our 5.25 Subordinated Notes due January 2061 (refer to Senior and Subordinated Notes below), we generally may not make payments on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock. 
 During Nine Months 2024, we repurchased 990,010 shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 180.0 million, exclusive of commissions. In November 2023, the Board authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to 600.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2024, 494.5 million aggregate cost at purchase remained unused under the repurchase authorization. The timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on various factors, including those listed above. 
 Assurant Subsidiaries 
 The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and net investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries funds in order to generate investment income. 
 We conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. These studies are conducted in accordance with formal company-wide Asset Liability Management guidelines. 
 To complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a varied set of plausible economic scenarios. These models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. For risks related to modeling, see Item 1A Risk Factors Financial Risks Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management. in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Alternative asset portfolio structures are analyzed for significant lines of business. An investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk appetite. Scenario testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed. 
 Our liabilities generally have limited policyholder optionality, which means that the timing of payments is generally insensitive to the interest rate environment. In addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid public fixed-maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs. 
 Generally, our subsidiaries premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. However, there may be instances when unexpected cash needs arise in excess of what is available from usual operating sources. In such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds, including selling assets from the subsidiaries investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper, or drawing funds from the Credit Facility.

Senior and Subordinated Notes 
 The following table shows the principal amount and carrying value of our outstanding debt, less unamortized discount and issuance costs as applicable, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Principal Amount Carrying Value Principal Amount Carrying Value 6.10 Senior Notes due February 2026 175.0 174.1 175.0 173.7 4.90 Senior Notes due March 2028 300.0 298.5 300.0 298.2 3.70 Senior Notes due February 2030 350.0 348.1 350.0 347.9 2.65 Senior Notes due January 2032 350.0 347.3 350.0 347.0 6.75 Senior Notes due February 2034 275.0 272.8 275.0 272.7 7.00 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 2048 400.0 397.5 400.0 397.0 5.25 Subordinated Notes due January 2061 250.0 244.2 250.0 244.1 Total Debt 2,082.5 2,080.6 
 In the next five years, we have a debt maturity in each of February 2026 and March 2028, when the 2026 Senior Notes and the 2028 Senior Notes, respectively, become due and payable. 
 Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program 
 We have a 500.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Credit Facility provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of 500.0 million, which may be increased up to 700.0 million. The Credit Facility is available until December 2026, provided we are in compliance with all covenants. The Credit Facility has a sublimit for letters of credit issued thereunder of 50.0 million. The proceeds from these loans may be used for our commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes. 
 We made no borrowings under the Credit Facility during Nine Months 2024 and no loans were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our commercial paper program requires us to maintain liquidity facilities either in an available amount equal to any outstanding notes from the program or in an amount sufficient to maintain the ratings assigned to the notes issued from the program. Our commercial paper is rated AMB-1+ by A.M. Best, P-2 by Moody s and A-2 by S P. This program is currently backed up by the Credit Facility, of which 500.0 million was available as of September 30, 2024. 
 We did not use the commercial paper program during Nine Months 2024 and there were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities. 
 Cash Flows 
 We monitor cash flows at the consolidated and entity levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and entity levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. 
 The table below shows our net cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Net cash provided by (used in): 2024 2023 Operating activities 1,229.9 775.5 Investing activities (728.8) (640.8) Financing activities (317.8) (241.9) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2.7 (4.2) Net change in cash 186.0 (111.4) 
 We typically generate operating cash inflows from premiums collected from our insurance products, fees received for services and income received from our investment portfolio, while outflows generally consist of policy acquisition costs, 
 46 

benefits paid and operating expenses. These net cash flows are then invested to meet the obligations of our insurance products and required capital supporting these products. Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees, and investment income received and expenses paid. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 1.23 billion for Nine Months 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 775.5 million for Nine Months 2023. The change in net operating cash flows was largely attributable to the timing of collections of premiums and fees in our mobile business operations and timing of tax payments as we received a refund in 2024 related to prior year tax returns as compared to a payment in 2023. This was partially offset by the timing of payments to various vendors for the acquisition of mobile devices used to meet insurance claims or generate profits through sales to third parties, higher net paid claims and an increase in employee incentive-based payments largely based on the performance of the Company. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 728.8 million for Nine Months 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 640.8 million for Nine Months 2023. The change in net investing cash flows was primarily driven by the increased investment of net cash provided by operating activities and reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of fixed maturity securities during the period. Also contributing to the change was a decrease in sales of short-term investments due to the timing of working capital needs. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 317.8 million for Nine Months 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 241.9 million for Nine Months 2023. The change in net financing cash flows was primarily due to higher share repurchases for Nine Months 2024 and the issuance of the 2026 Senior Notes during Nine Months 2023, partially offset by the redemption of our 4.20 senior notes due 2023 during Nine Months 2023. For additional detail on our debt, refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 The table below shows our cash outflows for interest and dividends for the periods indicated: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest paid on debt 82.7 99.0 Common stock dividends 114.8 113.8 Total 197.5 212.8 
 Letters of Credit 
 In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements in which we are the reinsurer. These letters of credit are supported by commitments under which we are required to indemnify the financial institution issuing the letter of credit if the letter of credit is drawn.
