of net sales of any product based on the Technologies.
If the Company elects to sublicense any rights under the License Agreement and amendment, the Company agrees to pay to the University
 of any up-front sub-license fees for any sub-licenses that occurred on or after September 9, 2006, and, on behalf of the sub-licensee,
 of net sales by the sub-licensee of all products based on the Technologies. The Company had sales revenue for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and therefore was not subject to paying any royalties. 

In
the event the Company fails to provide the University with semi-annual reports on the progress or fails to continue to make reasonable
commercial efforts towards obtaining regulatory approval for products based on the Technologies, the University may convert our exclusive
license into a non-exclusive arrangement. Interest on any amounts owed under the License Agreement and amendment will be at per annum.
All intellectual property rights resulting from the Technologies or improvements thereon will remain the property of the other inventors
and/or Dr. Lovejoy, and/or the University, as the case may be. The Company has agreed to pay all out-of-pocket filing, prosecution and
maintenance expenses in connection with any patents relating to the Technologies. In the case of infringement upon any patents relating
to the Technologies, the Company may elect, at its own expense, to bring a cause of action asserting such infringement. In such a case,
after deducting any legal expenses the Company may incur, any settlement proceeds will be subject to the royalty payment owed to
the University under the License Agreement and amendment. 

The
patent applications were made in the name of Dr. Lovejoy and other inventors, but the Company s exclusive, worldwide rights to
such patent applications are included in the License Agreement and its amendment with the University. The Company maintains exclusive
licensing agreements and it currently controls the five intellectual patent properties. 

Legal
Proceedings 

From

administrative actions, investigations or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Notice of Delisting 

On
July 24, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter (the Notification Letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Nasdaq stating that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)
for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid
price of 1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists
if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company s common
stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Notification Letter, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price
requirement. The Notification Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq
Capital Market and, at this time, the common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol PTIX . 

The
Notification Letter states that the Company has 180 calendar days, or until January 20, 2025, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company s closing bid price of the Company s common stock must have a closing bid
price of at least 1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. 

The
letter further states that in the event the Company does not regain compliance by January 20, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an
additional 180 days if it meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing
standards for Nasdaq, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure
the deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company does not qualify for the second compliance period or fails to regain
compliance during the second compliance period, Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that its common stock is subject
to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel pursuant to the procedures set forth
in the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. However, there can be no assurance that, if the Company does appeal the delisting determination
by Nasdaq to the panel, such appeal would be successful.

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, 
 will, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, believe, 
 continue, identify or other similar words or the negatives thereof. These may include our financial estimates
and their underlying assumptions, statements about plans, objectives, intentions and expectations. Such forward-looking statements are
subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results
to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe these factors include but are not limited to those described
under the section entitled Risk Factors in our prospectus and our Annual Report on form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, and any such updated factors included in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC s website
at www.sec.gov. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements
that are included in this document (or our prospectus and other filings). Except as otherwise required by federal securities laws, we
undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments
or otherwise. 

SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain forward-looking 
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ). You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as could, 
 expect, anticipate, estimate, target, may, project, 
 guidance, intend, plan, believe, will, potential, 
 opportunity, future and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion
of future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties,
including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations.
These statements relate to, among other things, our business strategy, our research and development, our product development efforts,
our ability to commercialize our product candidates, the activities of our licensees, our prospects for initiating partnerships or collaborations,
the timing of the introduction of products, the effect of new accounting pronouncements, uncertainty regarding our future operating results
and our profitability, anticipated sources of funds as well as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. 

We
have included more detailed descriptions of these risks and uncertainties and other risks and uncertainties applicable to our business
that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements in Part II-Item 1A Risk Factors 
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We encourage you to read those descriptions carefully. Although we believe we have been prudent
in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved.
We caution investors not to place significant reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this document; such statements need
to be evaluated in light of all the information contained in this document. Furthermore, the statements speak only as of the date of
this document, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements.

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate such estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base these estimates on historical experience
and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant expenses and minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from
operations for the foreseeable future, and those expenses and losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
We anticipate that our expenses will fluctuate substantially as we: 

continue
 our ongoing preclinical studies, clinical trials and our product development activities for our pipeline of product candidates; 

seek
 regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

continue
 research and preclinical development and initiate clinical trials of our other product candidates; 

seek
 to discover and develop additional product candidates either internally or in partnership with other pharmaceutical companies; 

adapt
 our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products; 

maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

incur
 additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. 

Overview 

Our
proprietary, patent-protected, first-in-class lead compound, PT00114, is a synthetic form of Teneurin Carboxy-terminal Associated Peptide TCAP ), an endogenous brain signaling peptide that can dampen overactive stress responses. Our preclinical models have
demonstrated efficacy of PT00114 in animal models of depression, anxiety, substance abuse addiction, and PTSD. 

PT00114
leverages a completely novel mechanism of action. Protagenic owns exclusive, worldwide rights to PT00114 through its license agreement
with the University of Toronto and has an exclusive right to license additional intellectual property generated by Dr. David Lovejoy s
lab at University of Toronto. Additionally, the company is engaged in the research development of follow-on compounds in the TCAP
family. Extensive publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals underline the central role stress plays in the onset and proliferation
of neuropsychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety, substance abuse addiction, and PTSD. The mechanism of action of TCAP suggests
that it counterbalances stress overdrive at the cellular level within the brain s stress response cascade. TCAP works to alleviate
the harmful behavioral, biochemical, and physiological effects of these disorders, while simultaneously restoring brain health. This
mechanism has been corroborated in preclinical animal models of the psychiatric disorders listed above. Preclinical experiments required
for IND filing have been completed. The Company is in the process of answering regulatory questions in the US and Germany. 

On
September 26, 2023, we announced the commencement of the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for PT00114. The trial aims to evaluate the therapeutic
potential of PT00114 in treating an array of neuro-psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Phase I will recruit
56 subjects, randomized to undergo subcutaneous injections of either PT00114 or a placebo. The Phase I/IIa study will assess both healthy
volunteers and patients diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Besides monitoring disease
status, the trial will gauge disease response by measuring biomarkers, such as circulating cortisol levels before and after treatment.

Results
of Operations 

We
are a development stage company currently performing clinical trials to obtain Food and Drug Administration FDA approval
and commercialization of our product. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from operations of 652,066 as compared to 1,431,712 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the loss is from a decrease in research and development expense of 799,678 from 1,124,030
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 324,352 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in general and administrative
expenses of 19,800 from 307,682 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 287,882 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, offset by an increase in research and development expenses from related parties of 39,832 from 0 for the three months ended September
30, 2023 to 39,832 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from operations of 4,057,772 as compared to 3,314,748 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the loss is from an increase in research and development expense of 929,813 from 2,051,685
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,981,498 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in general and administrative
expenses of 12,485 from 1,006,308 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,018,793 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, offset by a decrease in research and development expenses from related parties of 199,274 from 256,755 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to 57,481 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
increase in R D expense is due to our clinical trials moving forward causing an increase in related expenses. This increase has been
the primary driver of our increased loss from operations for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
same period for 2023. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

We
continually project anticipated cash requirements, predominantly from the ongoing funding requirements of our neuropeptide drug development
program. The majority of these costs relate to paying external vendors such as Contract Research Organizations, peptide synthesizer companies,
and new drug development. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,055,805 and working capital of 633,389. We anticipate further
losses from the development of our business. Based on its cash resources as of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have sufficient
resources to fund its operations past twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.
Absent generation of sufficient revenue from the execution of the Company s business plan, the Company will need to obtain debt
or equity financing by the third quarter of 2025. Because of these factors, the Company believes that there is substantial doubt in the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. 

Operating
activities used 3,396,726 and 2,559,342 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The use of cash
in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of 3,971,601 net loss, 37,715 in depreciation
expense, 677,703 in stock compensation expense, realized gain on sale of marketable securities of 51,732, a decrease in prepaid expenses
of 222,879, and a 134,068 increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses for both related parties and non-related parties, which
included payments to legal and accounting professionals, payments to consultants, and other administrative expenses. 

Investing
activities provided 2,802,880 and 2,497,407 in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash
provided by investing activities was from 3,100,000 sale of marketable securities, offset by 297,120 used in the purchase of marketable
securities the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Financing
activities provided 361,490 and 0 in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash provided
by financing activities was from the sale of common stock.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation,
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Due to material weaknesses, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that our disclosure
and controls are not designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Material
Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses we identified are described below: 

1) 
 We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and
 nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent
 possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate
 individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls
 and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2) 
 Limited
 level of multiple reviews among those tasked with preparing the financial statements. 

These
material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not
be prevented or detected. 

Remediation
Plan 

To
address the material weakness described above the Company has engaged an independent third party to enhance our segregation of duties. 

Since
we remain a small Company, with limited segregation of duties, the third party has identified certain areas where we can layer in added
controls and procedures. Management intends to implement such controls and procedures in the future. 

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions regarding the likelihood
of certain events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Given these and other inherent limitations of control systems, these are only reasonable assurances that our controls will
succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered
by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part
II: Other Information 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time we may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no legal proceedings, government actions,
administrative actions, investigations or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Our
business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully
consider the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC
on April 1, 2024, together with the information contained elsewhere in this report, including Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements 
and Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in
our other SEC filings in evaluating our business. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations, prospects for growth, and the value of an investment in our securities. 

There
were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.
