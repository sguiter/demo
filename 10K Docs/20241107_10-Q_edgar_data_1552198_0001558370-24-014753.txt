An increase or decrease in the market quote for an investment would in isolation result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. An increase or decrease in the exit multiple would in isolation result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. As the fair value of a debt investment diverges from par, which would generally be the case for non-accrual loans, the fair value measurement of that investment is more susceptible to volatility from changes in exit multiples as a significant unobservable input.

 (1) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the investments. Valuation of investments may be determined by weighting various valuation techniques. Significant judgment is required in selecting the assumptions used to determine the fair values of these investments. The valuation methods selected for a particular investment are based on the circumstances and on the sufficiency of data available to measure fair value. If more than one valuation method is used to measure fair value, the results are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the nature of the instrument, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on

Performance-based Incentive Fee The performance-based incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, except as provided by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism discussed below. The calculations of these components have been structured to include a fee limitation such that incentive fee will be paid to the investment adviser for any quarter if, after such payment, the cumulative incentive fees paid to the investment adviser for the period that includes the current fiscal quarter and the 11 full preceding fiscal quarters, referred to as the Incentive Fee Look-back Period, would exceed 20.0 of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. Each quarterly incentive fee is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below) and a deferral mechanism through which the investment adviser may recap a portion of such deferred incentive fees, which is referred to together as the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. This limitation is accomplished by subjecting each incentive fee payable to a cap, which is referred to as the Incentive Fee Cap. The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is equal to (a) 20.0 of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period less (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to the investment adviser during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any quarter, the Company will pay incentive fee to its investment adviser in that quarter. The Company will only pay incentive fees to the extent allowed by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. To the extent that the payment of incentive fees is limited by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism, the payment of such fees may be deferred and paid in subsequent quarters up to three years after their date of deferment, subject to applicable limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement. The deferral component of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism may cause incentive fees that accrued during one fiscal quarter to be paid to the investment adviser at any time during the 11 full fiscal quarters following such initial full fiscal quarter. The Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return refers to the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) for each period during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period and (b) the sum of cumulative realized capital gains, cumulative realized capital losses, cumulative unrealized capital depreciation and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation during the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period.

WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) September 30, 2024 (in thousands, except share and per share data) 
 incentive fee is payable to the Company s investment adviser in any calendar quarter in which Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Hurdle Rate of 1.75 (7.00 annualized); 100 of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than 2.1875 in any calendar quarter (8.75 annualized) is payable to the Company s investment adviser. This portion of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than 2.1875 is referred to as the catch-up. The effect of the catch-up is that, if such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.1875 in any calendar quarter, the investment adviser will receive 20 of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the Hurdle Rate did not apply; and 20 of the amount of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875 in any calendar quarter (8.75 annualized) is payable to the Company s investment adviser (once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20 of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income). 
 The portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or original issue discount) will be paid to the investment adviser, together with interest from the date of deferral to the date of payment, only if and to the extent that the Company actually receives such interest in cash, and any accrual will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such amounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possibly elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the Hurdle Rate from quarter to quarter and, accordingly, there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly Hurdle Rate and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly Hurdle Rate. Since the Hurdle Rate is fixed, as interest rates rise, it will be easier for the investment adviser to surpass the Hurdle Rate and receive an incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income. Net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of consolidated gross assets used to calculate the base management fee. These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. The second component, the capital gains component of the incentive fee (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee ), which is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commenced on January 1, 2013, and equals 20 of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from January 1 through the end of each calendar year, computed net of aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of each year (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee Base ), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees and subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee will be payable for the year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating

These commitments are often subject to financial or non-financial milestones and other conditions to borrow that must be achieved before the commitment can be drawn. In addition, the commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

 69 

whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, in the future, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. You should understand that under Sections 27A(b)(2)(B) and (D) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Sections 21E(b)(2)(B) and (D) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, do not apply to statements made in connection with this quarterly report on Form 10-Q or any periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act. Overview We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We were formed on December 28, 2011 and commenced operations on January 1, 2012. We were originally capitalized with approximately 176.3 million of contributed assets from two private funds that were advised by an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital, L.L.C., or H.I.G. Capital. These assets were contributed as of January 1, 2012 in exchange for 11,752,383 units in WhiteHorse Finance, LLC. On December 4, 2012, we converted from a Delaware LLC into a Delaware corporation and elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. On December 4, 2012, we priced our initial public offering, or the IPO, selling 6,666,667 shares. Concurrent with the IPO, certain of our directors and officers, the managers of H.I.G. WhiteHorse Advisers, LLC WhiteHorse Advisers or the Investment Adviser and their immediate family members or entities owned by, or family trusts for the benefit of, such persons, purchased an additional 472,673 shares through a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act. Our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol WHF. We are a direct lender targeting debt investments in privately held, lower middle market companies located in the United States. We define the lower middle market as those companies with enterprise values between 50 million and 350 million. Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily by originating and investing in senior secured loans, including first lien and second lien facilities, to performing lower middle market companies across a broad range of industries. Such loans typically carry a floating interest index rate such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus a spread and typically have a term of three to six years. While we focus principally on originating senior secured loans to lower middle market companies, we may also opportunistically make investments at other levels of a company s capital structure, including mezzanine loans or equity interests, and in companies outside of the lower middle market, to the extent we believe the investment presents an opportunity to achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return. We also may receive warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments. We expect to generate current income through the receipt of interest payments, as well as origination and other fees, capital appreciation and dividends. Reference Rate Reform In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, announced that it would phase out the use of the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, by 2021. One-week and two-month U.S. 

 70 

dollar LIBOR and non-U.S. LIBOR ceased at the end of 2021, and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors ceased after June 30, 2023. In light of feedback received, the FCA proposed that the one-, three- and six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors continue to be published on a synthetic basis through September 2024. Other jurisdictions have also proposed their own alternatives to LIBOR, including the Sterling Overnight Index Average for Sterling markets, the Euro Short Term Rate for Euros and Tokyo Overnight Average Rate for Japanese Yen. To identify a successor rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. LIBOR is no longer utilized as the floating benchmark rate on our debt investments to portfolio companies or Credit Facility. Revenues We generate revenue in the form of interest payable on the debt securities that we hold and capital gains and distributions, if any, on the portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured loans or mezzanine loans, typically have terms of three to six years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate based on a spread over SOFR or an equivalent index rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly or quarterly, with the amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years from the date of the initial investment. In some cases, we may also defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. We capitalize loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount, and we then amortize such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, we record any unamortized loan origination fees as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as fee income when earned. Dividend income is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Expenses Our primary operating expenses include (1) investment advisory fees to WhiteHorse Advisers; (2) the allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement; (3) the interest expense on our outstanding debt; and (4) other operating costs as detailed below. Our investment advisory fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, consummating and monitoring our investments. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: our organization; calculating our net asset value and net asset value per share (including the costs and expenses of independent valuation firms); fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by WhiteHorse Advisers or payable to third parties in performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; the costs of all future offerings of common shares and other securities, and other incurrences of debt; the base management fee and any incentive fee; distributions on our shares; transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; 

 71 

amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, evaluating, making and disposing of investments; brokerage fees and commissions; registration fees; listing fees; taxes; independent directors fees and expenses; costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs; costs of holding stockholder meetings; our fidelity bond; directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and any other insurance premiums; litigation, indemnification and other non-recurring or extraordinary expenses; direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, including audit and legal costs; fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts, including deal sourcing and marketing to financial sponsors; dues, fees and charges of any trade association of which we are a member; and all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or WhiteHorse Administration in connection with administering our business, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs and expenses of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer along with their respective staffs. 
 WhiteHorse Advisers or WhiteHorse Administration may pay for certain expenses that we incur, which are subject to reimbursement by us.

Net investment income and net increase or decrease in net assets can vary substantially from period to period due to various reasons, including the level of new investments and the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, period to period comparisons of net increases or decreases in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. Consolidated operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: Net Investment Income Net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 9.2 million and 29.3 million, respectively. Net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 10.8 million and 32.1 million, respectively .

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average size of the debt portfolio, excluding STRS JV, was 567.7 million and 590.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average yield, excluding STRS JV, was 10.3 and 10.7 , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the weighted average size of the debt portfolio, excluding STRS JV, was 636.1 million and 650.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the weighted average yield, excluding STRS JV, was 11.7 and 11.3 , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a reversal of accrued interest from our investment to Telestream Holdings Corporation, negatively impacting total investment income by 0.3 million, or approximately 0.013 cents per share. PIK income increased by 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from investments to MSI Information Services, Inc. PIK income increased by 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from investments to portfolio companies Honors Holdings, LLC (d/b/a Orange Theory), MSI Information Services, Inc. and Telestream Holdings Corporation. We may invest in loans that contain a PIK interest rate provision where PIK interest is accrued at the contractual rates and added to loan principal on the reset dates to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. Fee and dividend income decreased by 0.5 million and 1.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower non-recurring fee income. We expect to generate some level of non-recurring fee income during most quarters from prepayments, amendments and other sources. Interest and dividend income from STRS JV increased by 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in base rates.

General and administrative expenses increased by 0.2 million and 0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher professional and legal fees. Excise Tax Expense We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders that will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of U.S. federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We may then be required to incur a 4 excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. Excise tax was 0.3 million and 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Excise tax was 0.2 million and 0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we accrued a net federal excise tax expense of 0.8 million and 1.0 million, respectively.

 Financial Condition, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Liquidity and Capital Resources As a business development company, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders. We generate cash primarily from offerings of securities, borrowings under the Credit Facility, and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We expect to fund a portion of our investments through future borrowings. In the future, we may obtain borrowings under other credit facilities and from issuances of senior securities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We may also borrow funds to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders. Our board of directors may decide to issue common stock, such as through at-the-market offerings, direct placements or otherwise, to finance our operations rather than issuing debt or other senior securities. Any decision to sell shares below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock is subject to stockholder approval and a determination by our board of directors that such issuance and sale is in our and our stockholders best interests. Any sale or other issuance of shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share results in immediate 

 76 

dilution to our stockholders interests in our common stock and a reduction in our net asset value per share. If we were to issue additional shares of our common stock during the next 12 months, we do not intend to issue shares below the then-current net asset value per share. Restricted cash and cash equivalents include amounts that are collected and held by the trustee appointed as custodian of the assets securing the Credit Facility. Restricted cash is held by the trustee for the payment of interest expense and principal on the outstanding borrowings or reinvestment into new assets. Restricted cash that represents interest or fee income is transferred to unrestricted cash accounts by the trustee generally once a quarter after the payment of operating expenses and amounts due under the Credit Facility. We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitments to fund approximately 28.2 million and 21.4 million, respectively, of revolving lines of credit or delayed draw facilities to our portfolio companies. We reasonably believe that we have sufficient assets to adequately cover and allow us to satisfy our outstanding unfunded commitments. Our operating activities provided cash and cash equivalents of 57.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily from the net proceeds received from realizations and repayments on our investments, partially offset by acquisition of investments and cash used from the net change in working capital. Our financing activities used cash and cash equivalents of 61.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily for repayments on the Credit Facility and the payment of distributions to stockholders. Our operating activities provided cash and cash equivalents of 74.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from the net proceeds received from realizations and repayments on our investments, partially offset by acquisition of investments and cash used from the net change in working capital. Our financing activities used cash and cash equivalents of 71.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to repayments on the Credit Facility , repayment of the 6.000 2023 Notes and the payment of distributions to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds from the 7.875 2028 Notes of 34.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalent resources of 20.7 million, including 9.5 million of restricted cash. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 173.4 million undrawn and available to be drawn under the Credit Facility based on the collateral and portfolio quality requirements stipulated in the related credit agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalent resources of 24.5 million, including 13.7 million of restricted cash. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 138.5 million undrawn and available to be drawn under the Credit Facility based on the collateral and portfolio quality requirements stipulated in the related credit agreement. STRS JV In January 2019, we and STRS Ohio formed a joint venture, STRS JV, that invests primarily in senior secured loans, including first lien and second lien facilities, to performing lower middle market companies across a broad range of industries that typically carry a floating interest index rate based on SOFR, or an equivalent index rate and have a term of three to six years. STRS JV invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest. STRS JV was formed as a Delaware LLC and is not consolidated by either us or STRS Ohio for financial reporting purposes. On July 19, 2019, STRS JV formally launched operations. As of September 30, 2024, STRS JV had total assets of 326.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, STRS JV had total assets of 332.2 million. We provide capital to STRS JV in the form of LLC equity interests and subordinated notes. In February 2023, we increased our capital commitment to the STRS JV in the amount of an additional 15.0 million, bringing our total capital commitment to the STRS JV to 115.0 million, comprised of 92.0 million of subordinated notes and 23.0 million of LLC equity interests. We previously increased our capital commitment in February 2022 to the STRS JV in the amount 

 77 

of an additional 25.0 million, bringing our then total capital commitment to the STRS JV to 100.0 million, comprised of 80.0 million of subordinated notes and 20.0 million of LLC equity interests. As of September 30, 2024, we and STRS Ohio owned approximately 65.71 and 34.29 , respectively, of the LLC equity interests of STRS JV. As of September 30, 2024, our investment in STRS JV consisted of equity contributions and subordinated note advance commitments of 23.0 million and 92.0 million, respectively, of which 1.9 million and 7.6 million were unfunded, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we and STRS Ohio owned approximately 65.71 and 34.29 , respectively, of the LLC equity interests of STRS JV. As of December 31, 2023, our investment in STRS JV consisted of equity contributions and subordinated note advance commitments of 23.0 million and 92.0 million, respectively, of which 1.9 million and 7.6 million were unfunded, respectively. STRS JV is managed by a four-person board of managers, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by STRS Ohio. All material decisions with respect to STRS JV, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the board of managers. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the board of managers; provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each member; (ii) the presence of three members of the board of managers; provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed by the member with only one individual present is entitled to cast two votes on each matter; or (iii) the presence of four members of the board of managers; provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each member.

At-the-Market Offering On March 31, 2023, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the Equity Distribution Agreement, with WhiteHorse Advisers, WhiteHorse Administration and B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the sales agent, or the Sales Agent, in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, with an aggregate offering price of up to 35.0 million. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through the Sales Agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us (the ATM Offering ). Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. We expect to use all or substantially all of the net proceeds from the ATM Offering to invest in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and for general corporate purposes. On March 15, 2021, we previously entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the 2021 Equity Distribution Agreement, with WhiteHorse Advisers, WhiteHorse Administration and Raymond James Associates, Inc., as the sales agent, or Raymond James, in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, with an aggregate offering price of up to 35.0 million (the 2021 ATM Offering ). We used all or substantially all of the net proceeds from the 2021 ATM Offering to invest in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and for general corporate purposes. The 2021 Equity Distribution Agreement with Raymond James is no longer effective. Gross proceeds of 4.4 million were raised from the 2021 ATM Offering with Raymond James. Credit Facility On December 23, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary WhiteHorse Credit I, LLC, or WhiteHorse Credit, entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with JPMorgan, as administrative agent and lender (the Credit Facility ). 

 79 

On January 4, 2022, the terms of the Credit Facility were amended to, among other things, continue to establish a temporary upsize to the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, which allowed WhiteHorse Credit to borrow up to 335.0 million for a four-month period that originally began on October 4, 2021. On February 4, 2022, the terms of the Credit Facility were further amended to, among other things apply an annual interest rate equal to applicable SOFR plus 2.50 to any borrowings under the Credit Facility. On March 30, 2022, the terms of the Credit Facility were further amended to, among other things: (i) increase WhiteHorse Credit s availability under the Credit Facility from 310.0 million to 335.0 million; (ii) retain an accordion feature which allows for the expansion of the borrowing limit up to 375.0 million; and (iii) increase the minimum funding amount from 217.0 million to 234.5 million. On April 12, 2023, the terms of the Credit Facility were amended to (i) apply an annual interest rate equal to the applicable base rate plus 2.50 to any USD denominated borrowings, and (ii) convert to SOFR for USD denominated borrowings effective June 6, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Facility provided for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount up to 335.0 million with an accordion feature which allows for the expansion of the borrowing limit up to 375.0 million, subject to consent from the Lender and other customary conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the required minimum outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were 234.5 million. Under the Credit Facility, there are two coverage tests that WhiteHorse Credit must meet on specified compliance dates in order to permit WhiteHorse Credit to make new borrowings and to make distributions in the ordinary course: (i) a borrowing base test and (ii) a market value test. The borrowing base test compares, at any given time, the aggregate outstanding amount of all Lender advances under the Credit Facility less the amount of principal proceeds in respect of the collateral on deposit in the accounts to the net asset value of the collateral, as set forth in the credit agreement, as amended and restated from time to time, in connection therewith (the Amended Loan Agreement ), and related documentation. To meet the borrowing base test, this ratio must be less than or equal to 60 , as set forth in the Amended Loan Agreement and related documentation. To meet the market value test, the value of WhiteHorse Credit s portfolio investments must exceed a minimum of 167.5 of the aggregate outstanding amount of all Lender advances as set forth in the Amended Loan Agreement and related documentation. Advances under the Credit Facility are based on SOFR for USD denominated borrowings plus an annual spread of 2.50 . The Credit Facility bears interest at EurIBOR for EUR denominated borrowings, CDOR for CAD denominated borrowings and SONIA for GBP denominated borrowings, plus a spread of 2.35 on outstanding borrowings. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. WhiteHorse Credit is required to pay a non-usage fee which accrues at 0.75 per annum on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments, to the extent the aggregate principal amount available under the Credit Facility has not been borrowed. WhiteHorse Credit paid an upfront fee and incurred certain other customary costs and expenses in connection with obtaining the Credit Facility. Any amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on November 22, 2025. The Credit Facility and the related documents require WhiteHorse Finance and WhiteHorse Credit to agree to make certain customary representations and to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Facility also includes customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature, including breaches of representations, warranties or covenants by WhiteHorse Finance or WhiteHorse Credit, the occurrence of a change in control, or failure to maintain certain required ratios. If we fail to perform our obligations under the Amended Loan Agreement or the related agreements, an event of default may occur, which could cause the Lender to accelerate all of the outstanding debt and other obligations under the Credit Facility or to exercise other remedies under the Amended Loan Agreement. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If any of our contractual obligations discussed above is terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.

As of December 31, 2023, the majority of our portfolio was comprised of senior secured loans to lower middle market borrowers, and nearly all of those loans were variable-rate investments, primarily indexed to SOFR, with fixed-rate loan investments representing 0.9 based on fair value. As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio had an average investment size of 5.2 million based on fair value and average debt investment size of 6.7 million, with investment sizes ranging from zero to 21.7 million and a weighted average effective yield of 12.4 (and a weighted average effective yield on income-producing debt investments of 13.7 ). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 169.3 million in new and existing portfolio companies, offset by repayments and sales of 198.1 million. Proceeds from sales totaled 72.9 million while repayments included 5.0 million of scheduled repayments and 120.2 million of unscheduled repayments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 86.4 million in new and existing portfolio companies, offset by repayments and sales of 132.5 million. Proceeds from sales totaled 50.8 million while repayments included 9.2 million of scheduled repayments and 72.5 million of unscheduled repayments. We actively monitor and manage our portfolio with regard to individual company performance as well as general market conditions. Investment decisions on new originations generally include an analysis of the impact of the new loan on our broader portfolio, including a top-down assessment of portfolio diversification and risk exposure. This assessment includes a review of portfolio concentration by issuer, industry, geography and type of credit as well as an evaluation of our portfolio s exposure to macroeconomic factors and cyclical trends. We believe that consistent, active monitoring of individual companies and the broader market is integral to portfolio management and a critical component of our investment process. Our investment adviser uses several methods to evaluate and monitor the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: frequent discussions with management and sponsors, including board observation rights where possible; comparing/analyzing financial performance to the portfolio company s business plan, as well as our internal projections developed at underwriting; tracking portfolio company compliance with covenants as well as other metrics identified at initial investment stage, such as acquisitions, divestitures, product development and specified management hires; and periodic review by the investment committee of each asset in the portfolio and more rigorous monitoring of watch list positions. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our investment adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. This risk rating system is intended to identify and assess risks relative to when we initially made the investment and could be impacted by such factors as company-specific performance, changes in collateral, changes in potential exit opportunities or macroeconomic conditions. All investments are initially assigned a rating of 2, as this grade represents a company that is meeting initial expectations with regard to performance and outlook. A rating may be improved to a 1 if, in the opinion of our investment adviser, a portfolio company s risk of loss has been reduced relative to initial expectations. An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if the risk of loss has increased relative to initial expectations and will be assigned a rating of 4 if our investment principal is at a material risk of not being fully repaid. A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in payment default and has significant risk of not receiving full repayment.

The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value: 

As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Investment Performance Rating in millions) Investments at Fair Value Percentage of Total Portfolio Investments at Fair Value Percentage of Total Portfolio 1 82.0 12.5 127.4 18.3 2 409.3 62.6 413.7 59.4 3 119.5 18.3 133.7 19.2 4 40.1 6.1 6.3 0.9 5 3.4 0.5 15.1 2.2 Total Portfolio 654.3 100.0 696.2 100.0 Distributions In order to maintain our status as a RIC and to avoid the imposition of corporate-level tax on income, we must distribute to our stockholders each taxable year an amount generally at least equal to the sum of 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid the imposition of certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses, or capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary losses, for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years on which we incurred no U.S. federal income tax. The timing and amount of our quarterly distributions, if any, are determined by our board of directors. While we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution, we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including the possible loss of our tax status as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared to stockholders distributions of 0.385 and 1.155, respectively, per share for total distributions of 8.9 million and 26.8 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we declared to stockholders distributions of 0.37 and 1.165, respectively, per share for total distributions of 8.6 million and 27.1 million, respectively . 

 84 

To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for a fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we estimate that distributions to stockholders included 26.8 million of ordinary income, for tax purposes, based on earnings for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and current earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The specific tax characteristics of the distribution are reported to stockholders subject to tax reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports with the SEC. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. In addition, in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we may declare a significant portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion may be as low as 20 of such dividend under published guidance from the Internal Revenue Service) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a stockholder generally would be subject to tax on 100 of the fair market value of the dividend on the date the dividend is received by the stockholder in the same manner as a cash dividend, even though most of the dividend was paid in shares of our common stock. We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder receives cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. Related Party Transactions We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: WhiteHorse Advisers manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment management services to us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. WhiteHorse Administration and certain of its affiliates provide us with the office facilities and administrative services, including access to the resources necessary for us to perform our obligations towards certain portfolio companies, pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We have entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital pursuant to which we have been granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the WhiteHorse name. 
 We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with WhiteHorse Advisers in accordance with the 1940 Act on December 4, 2012, which was most recently amended on November 1, 2023 and was executed on February 22, 2024. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, WhiteHorse Advisers manages our day-to-day investment operations and provides us with access to personnel and an investment committee and certain other resources so that we may fulfill our obligation to act as a portfolio manager of WhiteHorse Credit under the Credit Facility. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in future periods will be equal to (1) a management fee equal to 1.75 of the value of our consolidated gross assets; provided, however, that the management fee on consolidated gross assets financed using leverage over 200 asset coverage (in other words, over 1.0x debt to equity) will be equal to 1.25 and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. See Investment Advisory Agreement in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 

 85 

We also entered into the Administration Agreement with WhiteHorse Administration on December 4, 2012. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, WhiteHorse Administration furnishes us with office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. WhiteHorse Administration also furnishes us with resources necessary for us to act as portfolio manager to WhiteHorse Credit under the Credit Facility. If requested to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, WhiteHorse Administration will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which amount will not, in any case, exceed the amount we receive from the portfolio companies for such services. Payments under the Administration Agreement will be based upon our allocable portion of WhiteHorse Administration s overhead expenses in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer along with their respective staffs. WhiteHorse Advisers, WhiteHorse Administration or their respective affiliates may have other clients with similar, different or competing investment objectives. In serving in these multiple capacities, WhiteHorse Advisers, WhiteHorse Administration or their respective affiliates may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. Such persons may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities among us and other investment funds or accounts advised by or affiliated with WhiteHorse Advisers or WhiteHorse Administration. WhiteHorse Advisers or its affiliates will seek to allocate investment opportunities among eligible accounts in a manner that is fair and equitable over time and consistent with its allocation policy. However, we can offer no assurance that such opportunities will be allocated to us fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time. We depend on the communications and information systems and policies of WhiteHorse Advisers and its affiliates as well as certain third-party service providers to monitor and prevent cybersecurity incidents. Our board of directors and management periodically review and assess the effectiveness of such communications and information systems and policies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. We have identified the following as critical accounting policies and estimates. Principles of Consolidation Under the investment company financial accounting guidance, as formally codified in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company. As provided under ASC Topic 946, we generally consolidate any investment company when we own 100 of its partners or members capital or equity units. We own a 100 equity interest in each of WhiteHorse Credit, WhiteHorse Finance (CA), LLC WhiteHorse California ), WHF PMA Holdco Blocker, LLC, WHF American Craft Blocker, LLC, WhiteHorse RCKC Holdings, LLC and WhiteHorse Finance Holdings, LLC, which are investment companies for accounting purposes. As such, we have consolidated the accounts of WhiteHorse Credit, WhiteHorse California, WHF PMA Holdco Blocker, LLC, WHF American Craft Blocker, LLC, WhiteHorse RCKC Holdings LLC and WhiteHorse Finance Holdings, LLC into our financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility is treated as our indebtedness. Valuation of Portfolio Investments We value our investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820 s definition of fair value focuses on exit price in the principal, or most advantageous, market and prioritizes the use of market-based inputs over entity-specific inputs within a measurement of fair value. 

 86 

In addition, on December 3, 2020, the SEC announced that it adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which updated the regulatory framework for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. The rule permits a fund board to designate the fund s investment adviser to perform fair value determinations, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions. Effective September 8, 2022, the Board designated the Investment Adviser as the Company s valuation designee to perform the fair value determinations relating to all of our investments, subject to the oversight of the Board. Our portfolio consists primarily of debt investments. These investments are valued at their bid quotations obtained from unaffiliated market makers or other financial institutions that trade in similar investments or based on prices provided by independent third party pricing services. For investments where there are no available bid quotations, fair value is derived using proprietary models that consider the analyses of independent valuation agents as well as credit risk, liquidity, market credit spreads and other applicable factors for similar transactions. Due to the nature of our strategy, our portfolio includes relatively illiquid investments that are privately held. Valuations of privately held investments are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates. The determination of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed. Our net asset value could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher or lower than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such investments. The Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee, is responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. The Investment Adviser has retained one or more independent valuation firms to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation at least once during each 12-month period. Independent valuation firms retained by the Investment Adviser provide a valuation review on approximately 25 of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available each quarter to ensure that the fair value of each investment for which a market quote is not readily available is reviewed by an independent valuation firm at least once during each 12-month period. However, the Investment Adviser does not intend to have de minimis investments of less than 1.5 of our total assets (up to an aggregate of 10 of our total assets) independently reviewed. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by one or more independent valuation firms each quarter. When an external event occurs with respect to one of our portfolio companies, such as when a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we expect to use the pricing indicated by such external event to corroborate our valuation. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Investment Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for credit monitoring in accordance with our valuation procedures. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our investment committee and our Investment Adviser. The valuation committee, comprised of a number of representatives from different functions of the Investment Adviser, reviews these preliminary valuations, and on a quarterly basis, reviews the bases of the valuations by our Investment Adviser and the independent valuation firms. At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. Our Board, through the Audit Committee, performs oversight of the fair valuation process in accordance with Rule 2a-5. 

87 

Fair value of publicly traded instruments is generally based on quoted market prices. Fair value of non-publicly traded instruments, and of publicly traded instruments for which quoted market prices are not readily available, may be determined based on other relevant factors, including without limitation, quotations from unaffiliated market makers or independent third party pricing services, the price activity of equivalent instruments and valuation pricing models. For those investments valued using quotations, the bid price is generally used unless we determine that it is not representative of an exit price. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Financial investments recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the investment as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active public markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Investments for which fair value is determined using inputs defined above as Level 3 are fair valued using the income and market approaches, which may include the discounted cash flow method, reference to performance statistics of industry comparables, relative comparable yield analysis and, in certain cases, third party valuations performed by independent valuation firms. The valuation methods can reference various factors and use various inputs such as assumed growth rates, capitalization rates and discount rates, loan-to-value ratios, liquidation value, relative capital structure priority, market comparables, compliance with applicable loan, covenant and interest coverage performance, book value, market derived multiples, reserve valuation, assessment of credit ratings of an underlying borrower, review of ongoing performance, review of financial projections as compared to actual performance, review of interest rate and yield risk. Such factors may be given different weighting depending on our assessment of the underlying investment, and we may analyze apparently comparable investments in different ways. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Fair value for each investment is derived using a combination of valuation methodologies that, in the judgment of the investment committee of the investment adviser are most relevant to such investment, including being based on one or more of the following: (i) market prices obtained from market makers for which the investment committee has deemed there to be enough breadth (number of quotes) and depth (firm bids) to be indicative of fair value, (ii) the price paid or realized in a completed transaction or binding offer received in an arm s-length transaction, (iii) a discounted cash flow analysis, (iv) the guideline public company method, (v) the similar transaction method or (vi) the option pricing method. Investment Transactions and Related Investment Income and Expense We record our investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when we have determined that all material terms have been defined for the transactions. These transactions could possibly settle on a subsequent date 

 88 

depending on the transaction type. All related revenue and expenses attributable to these transactions are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations commencing on the trade date unless otherwise specified by the transaction documents. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are recorded on the specific identification method. We accrue interest income if we expect that ultimately we will be able to collect it. Generally, when an interest payment default occurs on a loan in our portfolio, or if our management otherwise believes that the issuer of the loan will not be able to service the loan and other obligations, we place the loan on non-accrual status and will cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, we remain contractually entitled to this interest. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written off when it becomes probable that such interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. Any original issue discount, as well as any other market purchase discount or premium on debt investments, are accreted or amortized to interest income or expense, respectively, over the maturity periods of the investments. Dividend income is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest expense is recorded on an accrual basis. Certain expenses related to legal and tax consultation, due diligence, rating fees, valuation expenses and independent collateral appraisals may arise when we make certain investments. These expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. Loan Origination, Facility, Commitment and Amendment Fees We may receive fees in addition to interest income from the loans during the life of the investment. We may receive origination fees upon the origination of an investment. We defer these origination fees and deduct them from the cost basis of the investment and subsequently accrete them into income over the term of the loan. We may receive facility, commitment and amendment fees, which are paid to us on an ongoing basis. We accrue facility fees, sometimes referred to as asset management fees, as a percentage periodic fee on the base amount (either the funded facility amount or the committed principal amount). Commitment fees are based upon the undrawn portion committed by us and we record them on an accrual basis. Amendment fees are paid in connection with loan amendments and waivers and we account for them upon completion of the amendments or waivers, generally when such fees are receivable. We include any such fees in fee income on the consolidated statements of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us, if any. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the period covered by our financial statements, many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates, and we expect that many of our loans to portfolio companies in the future will also have floating interest rates. These floating rate loans are usually based on a base rate, such as SOFR, that resets on a periodic basis. Interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our common stock and our rate of return on invested capital. Since we plan to use debt to finance investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 

 89 

Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands). 

Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Net Increase Basis Point Increase (Decrease) in Interest Income in Interest Expense (Decrease) (1) (300) (17,367) (5,009) (12,358) (250) (14,518) (4,174) (10,344) (200) (11,665) (3,339) (8,326) (150) (8,761) (2,505) (6,256) (100) (5,841) (1,670) (4,171) (50) (2,920) (835) (2,085) 50 2,920 835 2,085 100 5,841 1,670 4,171 150 8,761 2,505 6,256 200 11,682 3,339 8,343 250 14,602 4,174 10,428 300 17,522 5,009 12,513 

 (1) Excludes the impact of incentive fees. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7 - Related Party Transactions for further information. As of September 30, 2024, nearly all of the performing floating rate investments in our portfolio had interest rate floors. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset periodically to the applicable floor and, in the case of investments in our portfolio, quarterly to a floor based on base rates, only if the floor exceeds the index. Under these loans, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor. For a discussion of the risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure Since we are using debt to finance our investments, and we may use additional debt or preferred stock financing going forward, changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital, net investment income, value of our common stock and our rate of return on invested capital in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit markets, the size, credit quality or composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing, that could affect net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations or net income. It also does not adjust for the effect of the time-lag between a change in the relevant interest rate index and the rate adjustment under the applicable loan. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above. We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates. 

 90 

We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to facilitate settlement of purchases and sales of investments denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge economically the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies. We currently utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to protect ourselves against fluctuations in exchange rates. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. The following table provides a breakdown of our forward currency contracts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Realized gain (loss) on forward currency contracts 9 (9) 9 (12) Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on forward currency contracts (9) 31 27 25 Total net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on forward currency contracts 22 36 13 Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the period covered by this report, we, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, each of WhiteHorse Finance, WhiteHorse Advisers and WhiteHorse Administration is currently not a party to any material legal proceeding. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None.
