Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of LCNB Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of LCNB Corp. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Corporation has changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2023 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ASC 326 ). The Corporation adopted the new credit loss standard using the modified retrospective method such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Collectively Evaluated Loans Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Management s estimate of the allowance for credit losses (ACL), includes a reserve on collectively evaluated loans. The reserve on collectively evaluated loans is based on historical loss rates adjusted for qualitative factors. Management s adjustment for qualitative factors include actual and expected changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the Company operates that affect the collectability of financial assets; the effect of other external factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments, competition, and events such as natural disasters or pandemics; and model risk including statistical risk, reversion risk, timing risk, and model limitation risk. 
 
 Significant judgment was required by management in the selection and application of key metrics used to derive the quantitative portion of the ACL. Accordingly, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company s estimated ACL involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the Company s estimate of the ACL included, but were not limited to, the following: 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management s controls over the determination of the current quantitative assumptions and qualitative factor adjustments. 
 We tested the process for determining reserves on collectively evaluated loans including: 
 Evaluation of the appropriateness of management s methodology. 
 Testing the completeness and accuracy of data utilized by management. 
 Evaluation of the relevance and reliability of information used by management in the development of the estimate. 
 Evaluation of reasonableness of significant assumptions used in the quantitative analysis.

Evaluation of the reasonableness of qualitative adjustment factors, including consideration of whether the adjustments applied were reasonable given portfolio composition; relevant external factors, including economic conditions; and consideration of historical or recent experience and conditions and events affecting the Company. 
 
 Valuation of the Acquired Loan Portfolio Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2023 the Company acquired Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. In connection with the acquisition, management estimated the fair value of acquired loans based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions about credit risk, repayments, discount rates, and net losses upon default. 
 
 Significant judgment was required by management in the selection and application of certain subjective assumptions. Accordingly, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company s estimate of the fair value of acquired loans involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the Company s accounting for the acquired loan portfolio included, but was not limited to, the following: 
 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls including management s review of the fair value calculations performed by a third-party valuation specialist, completeness and accuracy of data, and key assumptions and inputs used in the estimate. 
 We tested management s process for estimating the fair value of acquired loans including: 
 Involvement of valuation specialists to assist us in testing management s methodology and significant assumptions used in the estimate. 
 Assessment of management s selection of valuation methodology and application of significant assumptions. 
 Evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate. 
 Evaluation of the relevance and reliability of information used in the development of the estimate. 
 Evaluation of the reasonableness of significant assumptions used in the estimate, including comparison to third party market sources, where available, and comparison to independently developed assumptions.

 Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock is an equity interest in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. It can be sold only at its par value of per share and only to the FHLB or to another member institution. In addition, the equity ownership rights are more limited than would be the case for a public company because of the oversight role exercised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in the process of budgeting and approving dividends. Federal Reserve Bank stock is similarly restricted in marketability and value. Both investments are carried at cost, which is their par value. 
 
 FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock are both subject to minimum ownership requirements by member banks. The required investments in common stock are based on predetermined formulas.

 Federal banking regulatory agencies allow an optional phase-in period of three years for banks to absorb the impact to regulatory capital of implementing CECL. LCNB has elected not to exercise this option and the full impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13 is included in regulatory capital as of December 31, 2023. Adoption of the ASU did not materially affect LCNB's regulatory capital ratios. 
 
 ASU No. 2022-02, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures" 
 ASU No. 2022-02 was issued in March 2022 and became effective for LCNB on January 1, 2023. These amendments eliminated previous troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") recognition and measurement guidance and, instead, required that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The amendments also enhance disclosure requirements and introduce new disclosure requirements for certain modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Additionally, the amendments require the disclosure of current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination. Adoption of ASU No. 2022-02 did not have a material impact on LCNB's results of consolidated operations or financial position.

 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 The ACL is an estimate of the expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, which is measured using relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. A provision for credit losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of these and other pertinent factors as discussed within Note 1 Basis of Presentation - Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements included in this Form 10-K. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, including the CECL methodology for estimating the ACL. This standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2023. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation - Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements for a summary of the impact adoption of ASU 2016-13 had on LCNB's ACL, retained earnings, and deferred taxes.

. Commercial industrial loans are offered to businesses and professionals for short and medium terms on both a collateralized and uncollateralized basis. Commercial industrial loans typically are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the business. Collateral, when obtained, may include liens on furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory, receivables, or other assets. As a result, such loans involve complexities, variables, and risks that require thorough underwriting and more robust servicing than other types of loans. 
 
 Commercial, Secured by Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by a variety of commercial, retail and office buildings, religious facilities, hotels, multifamily (more than four-family) residential properties, construction and land development loans, and other land loans. Mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied agricultural property are included in this category. Commercial real estate loan products generally amortize over five to and are payable in monthly principal and interest installments. Some have balloon payments due within one to after the origination date. The majority have adjustable interest rates with adjustment periods ranging from one to , some of which are subject to established floor interest rates. 
 
 Commercial real estate loans are underwritten based on the ability of the property, in the case of income producing property, or the borrower s business to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon global debt service, collateral value, financial strength and liquidity of any and all guarantors, and other factors. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated with a to maximum loan to appraised value ratio, depending upon borrower occupancy. 
 
 Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential real estate loans include loans secured by first or second mortgage liens on one to four-family residential properties. Home equity lines of credit are included in this category. First and second mortgage loans are generally amortized over five to with monthly principal and interest payments. Home equity lines of credit generally have a or less draw period with interest only payments followed by a repayment period with monthly payments based on the amount outstanding. LCNB offers both fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans. Adjustable rate loans are available with adjustment periods ranging between one to and adjust according to an established index plus a margin, subject to certain floor and ceiling rates. Home equity lines of credit have a variable rate based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin. 
 
 Residential real estate loans are underwritten primarily based on the borrower s ability to repay, prior credit history, and the value of the collateral. LCNB generally requires private mortgage insurance for first mortgage loans that have a loan to appraised value ratio of greater than or may require other credit enhancements for second lien mortgage loans. 
 Consumer Loans. LCNB s portfolio of consumer loans generally includes secured and unsecured loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures. Secured loans include loans to fund the purchase of automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and similar acquisitions. Consumer loans made by LCNB generally have fixed rates and terms ranging up to months, depending upon the nature of the collateral, size of the loan, and other relevant factors. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates, but pose additional risks of collectability and loss when compared to certain other types of loans. Collateral, if present, is generally subject to damage, wear, and depreciation. The borrower s ability to repay is of primary importance in the underwriting of consumer loans. 
 
 Agricultural Loans. LCNB s portfolio of agricultural loans includes loans for financing agricultural production or for financing the purchase of equipment used in the production of agricultural products. LCNB s agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery, livestock, crops, vehicles, or other agricultural-related collateral. 
 
 Other Loans, Including Deposit Overdrafts. Other loans may include loans that do not fit in any of the other categories, but it is primarily composed of overdrafts from transaction deposit accounts. Overdraft payments are recorded as a recovery and overdrafts are generally written off after 34 days with a negative balance.

 NOTE 9 - 
 
 Additions from acquisition of CNNB Balance, end of year 
 
 The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on t hird-party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. This typically results in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. 
 
 LCNB performs a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of the fourth quarter 2024, it was determined that the fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value and therefore, goodwill is considered not impaired.

 The Company and the Bank are parties to various claims and proceedings arising in the normal course of business.

 in excess of the previous two years' Bank net income to the holding company due to an million dividend for the acquisition of CNNB. In addition, the February 2024 dividend payment was also in excess of the previous two years' Bank net income. The Bank requested after-the-fact OCC approval for these excess payments and that approval remains outstanding. 
 
 The Bank must meet certain minimum capital requirements set by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company's and Bank's financial statements. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 
 In addition to the minimum capital requirements, a financial institution needs to maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of at least above its minimum risk-weighted capital requirements to avoid limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments to shareholders and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. A financial institution with a buffer below will be subject to increasingly stringent limitations on capital distributions as the buffer approaches zero.

 As of the most recent notification from its regulators, the Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since the last notification that would change the Bank's category. 
 
 On September 17, 2019, the FDIC finalized a rule that introduced an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The simplified rule was designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. It could be used beginning with the March 31, 2020 Call Report. Qualifications to use the simplified approach include having a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9 , less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. LCNB qualified to use the simplified measure for its December 31, 2022 regulatory capital calculations, but did not opt in. It did not qualify to use the simplified approach for its December 31, 2023 regulatory capital calculations.

 Effective February 1, 2009, the Company established a nonqualified defined benefit retirement plan, which is also unfunded, for certain highly compensated employees. The nonqualified plan ensures that participants receive the full amount of benefits to which they would have been entitled under the noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan in the absence of limits on benefit levels imposed by certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code.
