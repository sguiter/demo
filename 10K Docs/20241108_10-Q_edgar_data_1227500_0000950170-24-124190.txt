Important Notice about Information in this Quarterly Report 
 Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report to we, our, us, the Company and Equity refer to Equity Bancshares, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Equity Bank, which we sometimes refer to as Equity Bank, the Bank or our Bank. 
 The information contained in this Quarterly Report is accurate only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and as of the dates specified herein.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, should, could, predict, potential, believe, will likely result, expect, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, project, forecast, goal, target, would and outlook, or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Item 1A - Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 7, 2024, and in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report. 
 There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 external economic and/or market factors, such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve, inflation or deflation, changes in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition; 

losses resulting from a decline in the credit quality of the assets that we hold; 

the occurrence of various events that negatively impact the real estate market, since a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate; 

inaccuracies or changes in the appraised value of real estate securing the loans we originate that could lead to losses if the real estate collateral is later foreclosed upon and sold at a price lower than the appraised value; 

the loss of our largest loan and depositor relationships; 

limitations on our ability to lend and to mitigate the risks associated with our lending activities as a result of our size and capital position; 

differences in our qualitative factors used in our calculation of the allowance for credit losses from actual results; 

inadequacies in our allowance for credit losses which could require us to take a charge to earnings and thereby adversely affect our financial condition; 

interest rate fluctuations which could have an adverse effect on our profitability; 

a continued economic downturn related to a pandemic, especially one affecting our core market areas; 

potential fraud related to Small Business Administration SBA loan applications through the Paycheck Protection Program PPP as part of the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act 

the effects of a pandemic or other widespread public health emergencies; 

the costs of integrating the businesses we acquire, which may be greater than expected; 

the departure of key members of our management personnel or our inability to hire qualified management personnel; 

challenges arising from unsuccessful attempts to expand into new geographic markets, products, or services; 

a lack of liquidity resulting from decreased loan repayment rates, lower deposit balances, or other factors; 

inaccuracies in our assumptions about future events which could result in material differences between our financial projections and actual financial performance; 

an inability to keep pace with the rate of technological advances due to a lack of resources to invest in new technologies; 

disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems; 

3 

unauthorized access to nonpublic personal information of our customers, which could expose us to litigation or reputational harm; 

disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events affecting the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; 

required implementation of new accounting standards that significantly change our existing recognition practices; 

additional regulatory requirements and restrictions on our business, which could impose additional costs on us; 

an increase in FDIC deposit insurance assessments, which could adversely affect our earnings; 

increased capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all; 

restraints on the ability of Equity Bank to pay dividends to us, which could limit our liquidity; 

a failure in the internal controls we have implemented to address the risks inherent to the banking industry; 

continued or increasing competition from other financial institutions, credit unions, and non-bank financial services companies, many of which are subject to different regulations than we are; 

costs arising from the environmental risks associated with making loans secured by real estate; 

the occurrence of adverse weather or manmade events, which could negatively affect our core markets or disrupt our operations; 

the effects of new federal tax laws, or changes to existing federal tax laws; 

the obligation associated with being a public company requires significant resources and management attention; 

effect of pending and future litigation, including the results of the overdraft fee litigation against the Company that is described in this quarterly report; 

other factors that are discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors. 

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included in this Quarterly Report. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or verbal forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and unrecognized losses on held-to-maturity securities have not been recognized into income because the security issuers are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and the fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.

Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. Consumer loans are considered pass credits unless downgraded due to payment status or reviewed as part of a larger credit relationship. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings. Pass: Loans classified as pass include all loans that do not fall under one of the three following categories. Special Mention : Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company s credit position at some future date. Substandard : Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful : Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

At September 30, 202 4, and 2023, there were and in commitments to lend additional amounts on these loans. At modification date, the Company considers loans modified to borrowers in financial distress as loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated loans at modification date for the purposes of calculating the allowance for credit losses. These loans will be evaluated for credit losses based on either discounted cash flows or the fair value of collateral at modification date; however, subsequent to the modification date these loans will be evaluated for credit losses as part of the collectively evaluated pools after a period of ongoing performance under the terms of the modified loan. The Company closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk from a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense recognized within other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income and included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated credit loss includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate of expected credit loss is based on the historical loss rate for the class of loan the commitments would be classified as if funded.

The risk-based ratios include a capital conservation buffer of which can limit certain activities of an institution, including pa yment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers, if its capital level is below the buffer amount. Management believes as of September 30, 2024, the Company and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as are asset growth and acquisitions, and capital restoration plans are required. As of September 30, 2024, the most recent notifications from the federal regulatory agencies categorized Equity Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

There were material transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers into or out of a level as of the end of a reporting period. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-recurring Basis Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when there is evidence of loans individually assessed for credit losses. The fair value of loans individually assessed for credit losses with specific allowance for credit losses are generally based on recent real estate appraisals of the collateral. Declines in the fair values of other real estate owned, subsequent to their initial acquisitions, are also based on recent real estate appraisals less estimated selling costs. Real estate appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments made to real estate appraisals and other loan valuations are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.

The Company did t record any liabilities for which the fair value was measured on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023. Valuations of individually evaluated loans and other real estate owned utilize third party appraisals or broker price opinions and were classified as Level 3 due to the significant judgment involved. Appraisals may include the utilization of unobservable inputs, subjective factors and utilize quantitative data to estimate fair market value.

 Overv iew 
 We are a financial holding company headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. Our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Equity Bank, provides a broad range of financial services primarily to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through our network of 
 58 

71 full-service banking sites located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. As of September 30, 2024, we had consolidated total assets of 5.36 billion, total loans held for investment, net of allowance, of 3.56 billion, total deposits of 4.36 billion, and total stockholders equity of 504.0 million. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net income of 19.9 million and 45.6 million. The Company had net income of 12.3 million and 36.1 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. 
 Critical Accou nting Policies 
 Our significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the December 31, 2023, audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect our reported results and disclosures. Several of our accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others in terms of their importance to results. Changes in any of the estimates and assumptions underlying critical accounting policies could have a material effect on our financial statements. Our accounting policies are described in NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES in the Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and require complex management judgment are described below. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses: The allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected life of our loan portfolio. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management s evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay a loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications, and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The level of the allowance for credit losses maintained by management is believed adequate to absorb all expected future losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date; however, determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The actual realized facts and circumstances may be different than those currently estimated by management and may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The allowance for credit losses, as reported in our consolidated balance sheets, is adjusted by provision for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings and is reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. 
 The allowance represents management s best estimate, but significant changes in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in significantly different results than what is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Likewise, an improvement in loan quality or economic conditions may allow for a further reduction in the required allowance. Changing credit conditions would be expected to impact realized losses, driving variability in specifically assessed allowances, as well as calculated quantitative and more subjectively analyzed qualitative factors. Depending on the volatility in these conditions, material impacts could be realized within the Company s operations. Significant changes in economic conditions, both positive and negative, could result in unexpected realization of provision or reversal of allowance for credit losses due to its impact on the quantitative and qualitative inputs to the Company s calculation. Under the CECL methodology, the impact of these conditions has the potential to further exacerbate periodic differences due to its life of loan perspective. The life of loans calculated under the methodology is based in contractual duration, modified for prepayment expectations, making significant variation in periodic results possible due to changing contractual or adjusted duration of the assets within the calculation. 
 Goodwill: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized and expensed in the period identified. Goodwill will be assessed more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired. We have selected December 31 as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management conducted the quarterly qualitative assessment and has determined there was no evidence of a triggering event as of or during the period then ended. Based on this qualitative analysis and conclusion, it was determined that a more robust quantitative assessment was not necessary at our measurement date. 
 When performing quantitative goodwill impairment assessments, management is required to estimate the fair value of the Company s equity in a change in control transaction. To complete this valuation, management is required to derive assumptions related to industry performance, reporting unit business performance, economic and market conditions, and various other assumptions, many of which require significant management judgment. 
 59 

Although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 
 Results of Operations 
 We generate our revenue from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends on investment securities, and non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card income, trust and mortgage banking income. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. 
 Changes in interest rates earned on interest-earning assets or incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities and stockholders equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic change in net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international circumstances and domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, as well as developments affecting the consumer, commercial and real estate sectors within these markets. 
 Net Income 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with three months ended September 30, 2023: Net income allocable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 19.9 million, or 1.28 diluted earnings per share as compared to 12.3 million, or 0.80 diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.5 million. The increase was largely due to an increase in net interest income of 5.0 million, a gain on disposition in other real estate owned of 8.5 million, offset by an increase in other non-interest expense of 3.9 million and an increase in the provision for Income taxes of 2.1 million. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023: Net income allocable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 45.6 million, or 2.95 diluted earnings per share as compared to 36.1 million, or 2.30 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 9.5 million. The increase was largely due to an increase in net interest income of 17.1 million, an increase in non-interest income of 5.7 million, a gain on disposition in other real estate owned of 8.5 million, offset by an increase in other non-interest expense of 14.2 million, an increase in the provision for loan losses of 1.3 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of 4.3 million. 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. To evaluate net interest income, management measures and monitors (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of deposits and other funding sources, (3) the net interest spread, and (4) net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a volume change, and is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a yield/rate change. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with three months ended September 30, 2023 : The following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The yields and rates are calculated by dividing annualized income or annualized expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.

(1) The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year s average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the prior year s volume. The changes attributable to both volume and rate, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to the volume variance and the rate variance in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. 

Interest income increased 9.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Of this increase, 7.7 million is attributable to increases in average asset rate/yield. Realized rate increases were attributable to the higher coupons on loan production, purchase accounting accretion, as well as the Company's re-positioning of its investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. Rate increases were complemented by higher earning asset volume, accounting for the remaining 2.3 million in period over period growth. 
 The increase in interest expense of 4.9 million was due to the deposit portfolio repricing as market interest rates remained well above our historic cost of deposits as well as increased utilization of our FHLB borrowing line. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, net interest margin increased 36 basis points and net interest spread increased by 27 basis points to 3.19 from 2.92 . The increase in both is primarily due to the increase in yield on interest-earning assets, which outpaced the increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023 : The following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The yields and rates 
 62 

are calculated by dividing annualized income or annualized expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest yields/rates. The following table analyzes the change in volume variances and yield/rate variances for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.

(1) The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year s average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the prior year s volume. The changes attributable to both volume and rate, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to the volume variance and the rate variance in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. 

Interest income on interest-earning assets increased 39.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of this increase, 32.4 million is attributable to increases in earning asset yields. Yield on loans increased by 72 basis points, driven by continued repricing in a higher interest rate environment as well as the purchase accounting accretion following the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers. Investment yields contributed a comparative improvement of 13.4 million, primarily attributable to the Company's strategic repositioning in the fourth quarter of 2023. Earning asset volume generated a comparative increase of 7.0 million, driven by the addition of assets through the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers. 
 There was an increase in interest expense on Total interest-bearing deposits of 22.3 million due to the deposit portfolio repricing as market interest rates remained well above our historic cost of deposits as well as increased utilization of our FHLB borrowing line. 
 When compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net interest margin increased 41 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while net interest spread increased by 30 basis points to 3.19 from 2.89 . The increase in both can be attributed to an increase in the rate/yield earned on interest-earning assets and to a lesser extent the increase in volume of interest earning assets, offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities portfolio and utilization level of our FHLB line.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is increased by a provision for credit losses, which is a charge to earnings, and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, but is decreased by charge-offs when the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience within the Company s portfolio. This historical loss calculation is then modified to reflect quantitative economic circumstances based on evidenced economic conditions and regression formulas, which incorporate lag factors in identifying a sufficiently predictive adjusted-R square, as well as qualitative factors not inherently reflected in our historical loss or quantitative economic inputs. Included in our qualitative assessment is the consideration of prospective economic conditions over the next 12 months, considered the Company s reasonable and supportable forecast period. As these factors change, the amount of the credit loss provision changes. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with three months ended September 30, 2023: During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2003, there was a provision for credit losses of 1.2 million. The provision for the three months ended is primarily attributable to the establishment of reserves on non-PCD loans acquired in the KansasLand acquisitions and loan growth. The Company continues to estimate the allowance for credit losses with assumptions that anticipate slower prepayment rates and continued market disruption caused by elevated inflation, supply chain issues and the impact of monetary policy on consumers and businesses. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1.6 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross charge-offs were 1.8 million, offset by gross recoveries of 197 thousand. In comparison, gross charge-offs were 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by gross recoveries of 65 thousand. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a provision for credit losses of 2.4 million compared to a provision for credit losses of 1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in provision is primarily attributable to the establishment of reserves on non-PCD loans acquired in the Rockhold and KansasLand acquisitions and loan growth. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 3.5 million compared to net charge-offs of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross charge-offs were 4.0 million, offset by gross recoveries of 564 thousand. In comparison, gross charge-offs were 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, offset by gross recoveries of 536 thousand. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 The primary sources of non-interest income are service charges and fees, debit card income, mortgage banking income, trust income and increases in the value of bank-owned life insurance. Non-interest income does not include loan origination or other loan fees, which are recognized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method.

Salaries and employee benefits : There was an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 2.6 million for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increases in employee salaries, incentive compensation and employee benefits. The increase in employee salaries and wages was partially due to additional payroll costs from the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers. 
 Data processing : There was an increase in data processing costs of 599 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the renewal of software licenses. 
 Other real estate owned : The gain on disposition of other real estate owned resulted in a gain of 8.5 million. Excluding the one-time gain, other real estate owned increased by 653 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 due to the write-down of a previous bank location. 
 Amortization of core deposit intangible : Amortization of core deposit intangibles cost increased 313 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due to additional amortization from the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers. 
 Other: Other non-interest expenses consists of subscriptions, memberships and dues, employee expenses, including travel, meals, entertainment and education, supplies, printing, insurance, account related losses, correspondent bank fees, customer program expenses, losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate, other operating expenses, such as settlement of claims, losses from limited partnerships entered into for tax credits and provision for unfunded commitments. The primary driver of the decline from the comparative period is the maturing of legacy tax investments without comparative replacement. New solar tax investments now comply with PAM and no longer impact non-interest expense. 
 Merger expenses : To facilitate the KansasLand merger the Company realized expense of 618 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2024. No transactions were in process for the comparative period in 2023.

Salaries and employee benefits : There was an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 6.6 million for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increases in employee salaries and incentive compensation. The increase in employee salaries and wages was partially due to additional payroll costs from the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers as well as additional staff added during the year. The increase in incentive compensation is partially due to the reversal of stock base compensation expense due to the departure of several senior management members in 2023. 
 Net occupancy and equipment : There was an increase in net occupancy and equipment costs of 1.7 million for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increases in repairs and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and utilities expense partially attributable to current year merger transactions. 
 Data processing : There was an increase in data processing costs of 2.1 million for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the renewal of software licenses. 
 Amortization of core deposit intangible : Amortization of core deposit intangibles cost increased 594 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due to additional amortization from the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers. 
 Other real estate owned : The gain on disposition of other real estate owned resulted in a gain of 8.5 million. Excluding the one-time gain, Other real estate owned increased by 396 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Other: Other non-interest expenses consists of subscriptions, memberships and dues, employee expenses, including travel, meals, entertainment and education, supplies, printing, insurance, account related losses, correspondent bank fees, customer program expenses, losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate, other operating expenses, such as settlement of claims, losses from limited partnerships entered into for tax credits, provision for unfunded commitments and the maturing of legacy tax investments without comparative replacement. New solar tax investments now comply with PAM and no longer impact non-interest expense. 
 Merger expenses : To facilitate the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers the Company realized expense of 4.5 million for the period ended September 30, 2024.

Efficiency Ratio 
 The efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in the internal evaluation of performance and is not defined under GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures see Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Item 2. Our efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses, by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gain or loss from securities transactions. Generally, an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources. 
 The efficiency ratio was 54.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 68.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement was primarily due to the reduced non-interest expense from the gain on disposition of other real estate owned. Excluding the gain on disposition of other real estate owned, the efficiency ratio was 70.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 68.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The efficiency ratio was 62.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 69.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement was primarily due to the reduced non-interest expense from the gain on disposition of other real estate owned. Excluding the gain on disposition of other real estate owned, the efficiency ratio was 67.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 69.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In general, the Company records income tax expense each quarter based on its estimate of the full year s effective tax rate which includes, in addition to statutory rates, estimated amounts for tax-exempt interest income, non-taxable life insurance income, non-deductible executive compensation, valuation allowance on deferred assets, other non-deductible expense, and federal and state income tax credits anticipated to be available in proportion to anticipated annual income before income taxes. Certain items, however, are given discrete period treatment and the tax effects for such items are therefore reported in the quarter that an event arises. Events or items that may give rise to discrete recognition include excess tax benefits or shortfalls with respect to share-based compensation, changes in tax law, and non-deductible merger expense. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with three months ended September 30, 2023: The effective income tax rate for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, was 16.7 as compared to 13.5 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to an 11.5 million tax gain and related penalty recognized due to the surrender of BOLI in the second quarter of 2024 offset by the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the expected current and future utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, there was a comparative reduction in the recognition of tax benefit related to solar tax investments recognized under the hypothetical liquidation book value, partially offset by a new solar tax investment entered into in the second quarter of 2024 which qualifies for the proportional amortization method. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023: The effective income tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, was 21.2 as compared to 14.1 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. See drivers of change in the section above. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Total assets increased 320.6 million from December 31, 2023, to 5.36 billion at September 30, 2024. This variance was primarily due to an increase in loans held for investment of 268.0 million, a increase in available for sale securities of 121.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 143.6 million. Total liabilities increased 269.5 million to 4.85 billion at September 30, 2024. The change in total liabilities is mostly due to increases in total deposits of 217.5 million and Federal Home Loan bank advances of 196.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in Federal Reserve Bank borrowings of 140.0 million. Total stockholders equity increased 51.2 million from 452.9 million at December 31, 2023, to 504.0 million at September 30, 2024, principally due to net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a decrease in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, net of tax, offset by the increase in treasury stock.

Credit Quality Indicators 
 We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, current economic trends, and other factors. Loans are analyzed individually and classified based on credit risk. Consumer loans are considered pass credits unless downgraded due to payment status or reviewed as part of a larger credit relationship. 
 For additional information, see NOTE 3 LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES in the Condensed Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

Generally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual, or charged off, at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income earned in the current year is reversed against income and unpaid interest earned in prior years is charged off. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
 The nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, consisted of 285 separate credits and 232 separate borrowers. We had 5 non-performing loan relationships, totaling 12.4 million, with an outstanding balance in excess of 1.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 There are several procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by lenders and we also monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. In accordance with applicable regulation, appraisals or evaluations are required to independently value real estate and are an important element to consider when underwriting loans secured in part or in whole by real estate. The value of real estate collateral provides additional support to the borrower s credit capacity. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. 
 Potential Problem Loans 
 Potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has concerns about the borrower s ability to comply with repayment terms because of the borrower s potential financial difficulties. Potential problem loans are assigned a grade of special mention or substandard. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 14.2 million in potential problem loans which were not included in either non-accrual or 90 days past due categories, compared to 11.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 With respect to potential problem loans, all monitored and under-performing loans are reviewed and evaluated to determine if they are impaired. If we determine that a loan is impaired, then we evaluate the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses based on the unlikelihood of full repayment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms or the net realizable value of the pledged collateral. 
 72 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Please see Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses for additional discussion of our allowance policy. 
 In connection with our review of the loan portfolio, risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories are considered when assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include the following items. 
 Commercial and industrial loans are dependent on the strength of the industries of the related borrowers and the success of their businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are advanced for equipment purchases, to provide working capital, or to meet other financing needs of the business. These loans may be secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or other business assets. Financial information is obtained from the borrower to evaluate the debt service coverage and ability to repay the loans. 

Commercial real estate loans are dependent on the industries tied to these loans as well as the local commercial real estate market. The loans are secured by the real estate, and appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount. An evaluation of the project s cash flows is performed to evaluate the borrower s ability to repay the loan at the time of origination and is periodically updated during the life of the loan. 

Residential real estate loans are affected by the local residential real estate market, the local economy, and movement in interest rates. We evaluate the borrower s repayment ability through a review of credit reports and debt to income ratios. Appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount. 

Agricultural real estate loans are real estate loans related to farmland and are affected by the value of farmland. We evaluate the borrower s ability to repay based on cash flows from farming operations. 

Agricultural loans are primarily operating lines subject to annual farming revenues including productivity/yield of the agricultural commodities produced and market pricing at the time of sale. 

Consumer loans are dependent on the local economy. Consumer loans are generally secured by consumer assets but may be unsecured. We evaluate the borrower s repayment ability through a review of credit scores and an evaluation of debt to income ratios.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, was adequate to cover current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio as of such date. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not sustain losses in future periods, which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at September 30, 2024. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans measured on a collective basis totaled 37.8 million, or 1.1 of the 3.57 billion in loans measured on a collective basis at September 30, 2024, compared to an allowance for credit losses of 38.8 million, or 1.2 , of the 3.30 billion in loans measured on a collective basis at December 31, 2023. The total reserve percentage to total loans was 1.2 at September 30, 2024, and 1.3 at December 31, 2023. 
 Securities 
 We use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2024, securities represented 19.5 of total assets, slightly increasing from 18.3 at December 31, 2023. 
 At the date of purchase, debt securities are classified into one of two categories: held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. We do not purchase securities for trading purposes. At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed. Investments in debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity are carried at cost, and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts, only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated comprehensive income or loss until realized. Interest earned on securities is included in total interest and dividend income. Also included in total interest and dividend income are dividends received on stock investments in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the FHLB of Topeka. These stock investments are stated at cost. 
 The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of available-for-sale securities as of the dates shown.

Mortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages which are principally issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized and accreted over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments. As such, 
 76 

mortgage-backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally produce decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages, resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization. Securities purchased at a discount will reflect higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment, as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion. 
 The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected lives because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities cause the average lives of these securities to be much different than their stated lives. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, 72.2 and 73.2 of the residential mortgage-backed securities held by us had contractual final maturities of more than ten years, with a weighted average life of 4.6 years and 5.3 years and a modified duration of 3.9 years and 4.4 years. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessment 
 At September 30, 2024, we performed an interim qualitative analysis and concluded there were no indications that goodwill was impaired. For additional information, see Goodwill under "Critical Accounting Policies" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 
 Deposits 
 Our lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits. A variety of deposit accounts are offered with a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market, and time deposits. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations, comprehensive marketing strategy, and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits. 
 The following table shows our composition of deposits at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Equity Bank participates in the Insured Cash Sweep ICS service that allows the Bank to break large non-time deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other ICS banks to ensure FDIC insurance coverage on the entire deposit. These deposits are placed through ICS services but are Equity Bank s customer relationships that management views as core funding. The Bank also participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS program. CDARS allows the bank to break large time deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other CDARS banks to ensure FDIC insurance coverage on the entire deposit. Reciprocal deposits are not considered brokered deposits as long as the aggregate balance is less than the lesser of 20 of total liabilities or 5.0 billion and Equity Bank is well capitalized and well rated. All non-reciprocal deposits and reciprocal deposits in excess of regulatory limits are considered brokered deposits. 
 The following table lists reciprocal and brokered deposits included in total deposits categorized by type at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Other Borrowed Funds 
 We utilize borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investing activities. Short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings include federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Bank borrowings, a bank stock loan, and subordinated debt. For additional information see NOTE 6 BORROWINGS in the Condensed Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statement. 
 Liquidity and Ca pital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Market and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves. 
 Liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for future funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by considering both on and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. 
 Liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities, and the way they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our liquidity needs have primarily been met by core deposits, security and loan maturities, and amortizing security and loan portfolios. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings from the FHLB, and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings. 
 Our largest sources of funds are deposits and FHLB borrowings and largest uses of funds are loan funding, securities purchases and debt servicing. Average loans were 3.46 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.8 over the December 31, 2023, average balance. Excess deposits are primarily invested in our interest-bearing deposit account with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, investment securities, federal funds sold or other short-term liquid investments until the funds are needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio has a weighted average life of 4.5 years and a modified duration of 3.8 years at September 30, 2024. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 235.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 143.6 million from the 379.1 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is driven by 163.9 million net cash used in financing activities and 31.8 million net cash used in investing activities which was offset by 52.1 million net cash provided by operating activities. The 163.9 million net change in cash used in financing activities includes, 174.8 million in outflows for the decrease in deposits, 141.0 million in outflows for Federal Reserve borrowings, 15.0 million outflow for federal fund repurchased and retail repurchase agreements, 11.9 million outflow for the repurchase of treasury stock, 7.6 million in payments on capital tax credits and 5.6 million for the payment of dividends on common stock, offset by an increase in FHLB line of credit of 189.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents at January 1, 2024, plus liquidity provided by operating activities, pay downs, sales, and maturities of investment securities and FHLB borrowings during the first nine months of 2024 were primarily used to originate or purchase loans, to purchase investment securities and to facilitate the Rockhold and KansasLand mergers. We believe that our daily funding needs can be met through cash provided by operating activities, payments and maturities on loans and investment securities, the core deposit base and FHLB advances and other borrowing relationships. 
 79 

Off-Balance-Sheet Items 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. The same credit policies and procedures are used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments. 
 Standby and Performance Letters of Credit: For additional information see NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT RISK in the Condensed Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statement. 
 Commitments to Extend Credit: For additional information see NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT RISK in the Condensed Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statement. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Capital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. The federal bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. As a financial holding company and a state-chartered-Fed-member bank, the Company and Equity Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements. 
 Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company and Equity Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized; although, these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as are asset growth and acquisitions, and capital restoration plans are required. 
 Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of September 30, 2024, the most recent notifications from the federal regulatory agencies categorized Equity Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, Equity Bank must maintain minimum Total capital, Tier 1 capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios. For additional information, see NOTE 8 REGULATORY MATTERS in the Condensed Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Equity Bank s category. 
 Non-GAAP Finan cial Measures 
 We identify certain financial measures discussed in this Quarterly Report as being non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC s rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our statements of income, balance sheet or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios, or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Quarterly Report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the way we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Quarterly Report may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar to, or with names like, the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Quarterly Report when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.

Tangible Book Value Per Common Share and Tangible Book Value Per Diluted Common Share : Tangible book value is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles (net of accumulated amortization), and other intangible assets (net of accumulated amortization); (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding; and (c) tangible book value per diluted common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by diluted shares of common stock outstanding. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value. 
 Management believes that these measures are important to many investors interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value. 
 The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders equity to tangible common equity, tangible book value per common share, and tangible book value per diluted common share and compares these values with book value per common share.

Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets : Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles (net of accumulated amortization), and other intangible assets (net of accumulated amortization); (b) tangible assets as total assets less goodwill, core deposit intangibles (net of accumulated amortization), and other intangible assets (net of accumulated amortization); and (c) tangible common equity to tangible assets as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by tangible assets (as described in clause (b)). For tangible common equity to tangible assets, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is total stockholders equity to total assets. 
 Management believes that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace interested in the relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders equity and total assets while not increasing tangible common equity or tangible assets.

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity : Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate (a) average tangible common equity as total average stockholders equity less average goodwill, core deposit intangibles (net of accumulated amortization), and other intangible assets (net of accumulated amortization); (b) adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders as net income allocable to common stockholders plus intangible asset amortization (net of taxes); and (c) return on average tangible common equity as annualized adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders (as described in clause (b)) divided by average tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)). For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity. 
 
 Return on Average Common Equity, Pre-tax, Pre-provision: Return on common equity with annualized net income adjusted for pre-tax provision and pre-provision (reversal) for loan losses is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate (a) average common equity as total average stockholders equity; (b) adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders annualized, as net income allocable to common stockholders plus income tax provision and plus provision (reversal) for loan losses, divided by average common equity (as described in clause (a)). For adjusted return, pre-tax and pre-provision, on average common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity. 
 Management believes that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in earnings quality on tangible common equity. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total stockholders equity while not increasing tangible common equity.

Efficiency Ratio : The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses, by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gain on acquisition and branch sales, and net gain (loss) from securities transactions. The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is non-interest expense divided by net interest income plus non-interest income. 
 In management s judgment, the adjustments made to non-interest expense and non-interest income allow investors and analysts to better assess operating expenses in relation to operating revenue by removing merger expenses, net gain (loss) from securities transactions, and net gain in acquisition and branch sales.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Our asset-liability policy provides guidelines for effective funds management and management has established a measurement system for monitoring net interest rate sensitivity position within established guidelines. 
 As a financial institution, the primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short-term maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic gains or losses due to future interest rate changes. These changes can be reflected in future net interest income and/or fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income NII and economic value of equity EVE and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We manage interest rate exposure by structuring the balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We have the ability to enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, interest rate swaps, financial options, financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. Currently, we do not have a material exposure to these instruments. We also have the ability to enter into interest rate swaps as an accommodation to our customers in connection with an interest rate swap program. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset Liability Committee ALCO ), which is composed of certain members of senior management, in accordance with policies approved by the Board of Directors. ALCO formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, ALCO considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. ALCO meets monthly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, securities purchased and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investment securities and borrowings. Additionally, the ALCO reviews liquidity, projected cash flows, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. 
 84 

ALCO uses a simulation analysis to monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on net interest income. The simulation tests the sensitivity of NII and EVE. Contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the simulation model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment securities portfolio. Assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for non-maturity deposit accounts. All assumptions are as of the base period without consideration of preceding market rate changes and any lag in impact to NII. The depicted expectations are management's estimate exclusive of any non-contractual lagging impacts that have not yet been realized in income from preceding changes to interest rates. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure the future NII and EVE. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 The change in the impact of net interest income from the base case for September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by the rate and mix of variable and fixed rate financial instruments, the underlying duration of the financial instruments and the level of response to changes in the interest rate environment. 
 
 The decrease in the level of positive impact to net interest income in the up interest rate shock scenarios is due to the level of adjustable rate loans receivable that will reprice to higher interest rates, non-term deposits that will adjust to higher rates, the use of derivatives to hedge borrowing costs, and decreased levels of cash on the balance sheet compared to December 31, 2023. These factors result in an overall positive impact to net interest income at September 30, 2024, but at a reduced level from the December 31, 2023, simulation that are detailed in the table below. In the down interest rate shock scenario, the main drivers of the negative impact on net interest income are the downward pricing of variable rate loans receivable and the level of term deposit repricing; and the assumed prepayment and scheduled repayment of existing fixed rate loans receivable and fixed rate investments. These factors result in the negative impact to net interest income in the down interest rate shock scenario. 
 
 The change in the economic value of equity from the base case for September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, is due to being in a liability sensitive position and the level of convexity in our pre-payable assets. Generally, with a liability sensitive position, as interest rates increase, the value of your assets decrease faster than the value of liabilities and, as interest rates decrease, the value of your assets increase at a faster rate than liabilities. Due to the level of convexity in our fixed rate pre-payable assets, we do not experience a similar change in the value of assets in a down interest rate shock scenario, due to the current level of convexity in our fixed rate pre-payable assets becoming less negative and positive, in some cases, on a portion of or a portfolio has resulted in the overall value of assets increasing more than liabilities. In addition, the mix of interest-bearing deposit and non-interest-bearing deposits impact the level of deposit decay and the resulting benefit of discounting from the non-interest-bearing deposits. At September 30, 2024, non-interest-bearing deposits were approximately 69.7 million, or 7.76 , higher than that deposit type at December 31, 2023. Substantially all investments and approximately 37.0 of loans are prepayable and fixed rate and as rates decrease the level of modeled prepayments increase. The prepaid principal is assumed to reprice at the assumed current rates, resulting in a smaller positive impact to the economic value of equity. 
 Management utilizes static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on various rate scenarios. This analysis estimates a percentage of change in the metric from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet. The following table summarizes the simulated immediate change in net interest income for twelve months as of the dates indicated.
