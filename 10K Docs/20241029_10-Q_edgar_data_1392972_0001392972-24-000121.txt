 million during the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest related to the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2021. Interest related to the 2024 Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2019. 
 
 Each 1,000 of principal of the 2027 Notes will initially be convertible into shares of the Company s common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Each 1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes was initially to be convertible into shares of the Company s common stock, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share and was subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. 
 
 On August 23, 2023, the Company entered into legally binding exchange agreements with a limited number of existing holders of the 2024 Notes to exchange approximately million aggregate principal amount of the existing 2024 Notes for a principal amount of the 2027 Notes at an exchange ratio to be determined based on the daily volume-weighted average trading price of the Company s common stock over a thirty-day trading period beginning August 24, 2023 (such exchange transactions, the Exchange ). On October 10, 2023, the Company settled the exchange agreements for the exchange of million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2024 Notes for newly issued million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2027 Notes. Following the settlement of the Exchange, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes remained outstanding with terms unchanged. The 2027 Notes issued in the Exchange constitute a further issuance of, and form a single series and will be fungible with, the existing 2027 Notes. 
 
 Although the Exchange was not completed as of September 30, 2023, the Company determined that, from an accounting perspective, the Exchange was a legally binding restructuring of the debt that represented a substantial modification of the terms of the 2024 Notes subject to the Exchange, and therefore was required to be accounted for as an extinguishment transaction. This resulted in a million loss on debt extinguishment recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023 which was included in other income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In addition, the Company concluded that the variability in the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be issued in connection with the Exchange due to changes in stock price was a feature embedded in the restructured debt that was required to be accounted for as an embedded derivative and remeasured to fair value until settlement in October 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a derivative loss of million which was included in other income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The estimated fair value was determined based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including the Company's stock price, interest rates and the value of the 2027 Notes, which represented level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2027 Notes are not yet convertible and their remaining term is approximatel y months. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes in the aggregate was million and million, respectively. The estimated fair value was determined based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including the Company's stock price and interest rates, which represents level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

 Capped call transactions 
 
 In September 2020 and in May 2019, in connection with the offering of the 2027 and 2024 Notes, respectively, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (collectively, the "Capped Call") with certain option counterparties. The Capped Call transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of the Company s common stock initially underlying the Notes, at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Capped Call transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to the Company s common stock and/or offset any cash payments the Company will be required to make in excess of the principal amounts upon any conversion of the Notes, and to effectively increase the overall conversion price of the 2027 Notes from to per share and, for the 2024 Notes, from to per share. As the Capped Call transactions meet certain accounting criteria, they are recorded in stockholders (deficit) equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of the Capped Call was million and million for the 2027 and 2024 Notes, respectively, and was recorded as part of additional paid-in capital. On May 15, 2024, the 2024 Notes matured and the Capped Call associated with the 2024 Notes expired unexercised. The expiration of the 2024 Notes Capped Call did not have an impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In August 2023, in connection with the Exchange, the Company entered into additional capped call transactions (the Additional Capped Call with certain option counterparties. The Company agreed to pay a premium to the option counterparties for the Additional Capped Call for an amount to be determined based on the volume-weighted average trading price of the Company s common stock over a thirty-day reference period beginning August 24, 2023. The conversion price of the Additional Capped Call is the same as the 2027 Notes Capped Call above. Initial funding of the Additional Capped Call occurred in the third quarter of 2023. The Additional Capped Call had a deferred premium component indexed to the Company's stock price and required to be settled in cash, and therefore the Additional Capped Call was a derivative instrument that, at inception, did not meet the qualifications for equity classification. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a derivative loss of million, which was included in other income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The estimated fair value was determined based on valuation methods using inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including the Company's stock price and interest rates, and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, which represented level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. On October 10, 2023, the Company settled the deferred premium on the Additional Capped Call resulting in a final value of million . Once the deferred premium was settled, the instrument met the requirements for equity classification and the Company reclassified the Additional Capped Call to additional paid-in capital.

 In the third quarter of 2024 , we continued to grow our subscription revenue, increasing subscription revenue by 12 and 14 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Total revenue increased by 7 and 8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, recurring revenue (which consists of subscription revenue and maintenance and support revenue) accounted for 85 and 84 of total revenue, respectively. Our gross revenue retention rates remained above 93 during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we continued to improve on our profitability metrics. Our subscription gross profit margin was 78 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 76 and 75 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to c ash used in operating activities of 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement was primarily due to a significant reduction in our net loss. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 Key factors and trends that have affected, and we believe will continue to affect, our operating results include: 
 
 Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Environment . The companies we serve continue to navigate a challenging geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory environment impacted by geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, continued inflation, changing interest rates, supply chain disruptions, tight labor markets, pricing volatility, rapid new regulations, and other local and regional macroeconomic conditions. Uncertain macroeconomic, regulatory and industry conditions in the geographies where we operate create a continued challenging selling environment for enterprise technology deployments, including in some cases more complex customer review and approval cycles. For example, AI regulation, such as the EU AI Act, creates uncertainty and increases scrutiny by companies adopting AI, even where the AI utilized is compliant with applicable regulations. Despite this environment, we remain confident in our ability to help our customers drive profitable growth by optimizing their shopping and selling experiences. For example, pricing volatility and inflation can be meaningful catalysts for demand for our AI-driven price optimization and management solutions. We believe in the near term that new customers will continue to emphasize smaller scope initial purchases and fast return on their investments. We believe this emphasis will require solid execution by our teams to capitalize on these demand drivers. 
 
 Profitable Growth as a Priority . We continue to focus on our multi-year profitability progress by investing in a disciplined manner to drive revenue growth, increase operating margins and cash from operations and support our long-term initiatives. This includes investments designed to accelerate our customer time-to-value, improve efficiency and operations, further leveraging AI in our business operations, provide out-of-the-box integration with third-party commerce solutions and develop new applications and technologies. We expect our product development, sales and

 marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease long-term as we increase our revenues and continue to improve our profitability. 
 
 Artificial Intelligence . The rapidly evolving market interest in generative AI and associated interest in all aspects of AI continues to drive businesses around the world and across industries to consider, invest in and use applications leveraging AI. For example, companies use AI to extract insights from their data, improve and customize their offerings, and drive process and operating efficiencies. Our AI-powered solutions enable buyers to move fluidly and with personalized experiences across our customers sales channels, and our digital offer marketing solutions help our customers drive their buyers directly into their direct selling channels. The pace of change across industries helps fuel demand for our solutions as businesses look to replace manual processes with AI. We have utilized AI in our solutions for years and our deep experience in AI continues to influence our category-leading solutions. For example, our current AI uses a neural network to improve prediction accuracy. We are also utilizing and considering new ways to expand AI use in our own business operations to drive efficienci es, improve knowledge management, gain insights and increase productivity. 
 
 Travel Industry Dynamics . The travel industry continues to recover from the unprecedented disruption caused by the pandemic with global air passenger traffic exceeding pre-pandemic levels during 2024. Demand for air travel remains strong, and the airline industry is working to reestablish equilibrium in light of aircraft delivery issues and operational, cost and supply chain challenges. Airlines are increasingly recognizing the importance of competing for customers based on the total travel experience, while also improving financial performance. In some cases, this includes a renewed focus on revenue management systems. We believe our other solutions are also well-positioned, particularly as airlines look to enhance their digital marketing, booking capabilities, and ancillary offerings. However, operational challenges within the airline industry continue to impact sales cycles and approval processes. 
 
 Digital Purchasing Driving Technology Adoption . We believe the long-term trends toward digital purchasing by both consumers and corporate buyers drives demand for technology that provides fast, frictionless and distinctive buying experiences across direct sales, partner, online, mobile and emerging channels. Buyers often prefer to conduct their own research rather than rely primarily on sales representatives, and tend to make purchases online once they have decided what to buy. For example, in the airline industry, the pandemic accelerated a long-term trend towards direct booking channels, and we anticipate airlines continuing to invest in technology to enhance their ability to capture a greater percentage of bookings and provide direct offers through their own channels such as their websites. We believe companies increasingly compete based on customer experience and must adopt technologies which power consistent offers and experiences across sales channels.

 Subscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased primarily due to an increase in new and existing customer subscription contracts. 
 
 Maintenance and support revenue. Maintenance and support revenue decreased primarily as a result of existing maintenance customers migrating to our cloud solutions and, to a lesser extent, customer maintenance churn. We expect maintenance revenue to continue to decline as we continue to migrate maintenance customers to our cloud solutions. 
 
 Services revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, services revenue decreased mainly due to the completion of several large implementations during the third quarter of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, services revenue increased primarily as a result of higher sales of professional services to our existing customers.

Table of Contents 

 Services revenue varies from period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, which in turn can vary depending on the mix of new versus existing customer software solution sales. Services revenue is also impacted by the timing of services revenue recognition on certain subscription contracts and efficiencies in our solutions implementations requiring less professional services during a particular period.

 Cost of subscription. Cost of subscription remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of subscription increased primarily due to higher infrastructure costs to support the growth in our current subscription customer base and higher employee-related costs primarily due to an increase in headcount. These increases were partially offset by decreases in amortization expense for intangible assets and internal-use software expense. O ur subscription gross profit percentages were 78 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 76 and 75 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support decreased mainly due to lower personnel costs as our maintenance customer base has decreased primarily due to migrations to our subscription solutions. Maintenance and support gross profit percentages were 49 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 62 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit percentages decreased in 2024 as compared to prior year primarily due to lower maintenance and support revenue an d the cost of maintenance and support being partially fixed. 
 
 Cost of services. Cost of services remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, c ost of services decreased primarily due to a decrease in contract labor and other non-employee related costs . Services gross profit percentages were 1 and 3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3 and (1) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Services gross profit percentages vary period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, the utilization of our employees and our effective man-day rates.

 Selling and marketing expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, s elling and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs and was partially offset by increases in travel expenses, consulting and other non-employee related costs. Employee-related costs declined primarily due to a 1.3 million reversal of noncash share-based compensation expense, as certain performance criteria as a condition to vest is not expected to be met. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs. Employee-related costs declined primarily due to noncash share-based compensation expense, as the EveryMundo equity consideration vested in November 2023, and severance expenses incurred during the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in travel expenses.

Research and development expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs. Employee-related costs declined primarily due to a 1.3 million reversal of noncash share-based compensation expense, as certain performance criteria as a condition to vest is not expected to be met. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount and an increase in contract labor, partially offset by a decrease in noncash share-based compensation expense as the EveryMundo equity consideration vested in November 2023. 
 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a one-time recoupment of professional fees of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, mainly noncash share-based compensation expense, and was partially offset by a one-time recoupment of professional fees. 
 
 Non-operating expenses: Three Months Ended September 30, Variance Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Convertible debt interest and amortization (1,121) (1,497) 376 (25) (3,471) (4,649) 1,178 (25) Other income (expense), net 1,531 (4,288) 5,819 (136) 3,312 (1,046) 4,358 (417) 
 
 Convertible debt interest and amortization. Our convertible debt expense consists of coupon interest and amortization of debt premium and debt issuance costs attributable to our Notes. The decrease in expense was attributed to the exchange of approximately 85 of outstanding convertible notes due in May 2024 for newly issued convertible notes now due in September 2027. See Note 8 for more information. 
 
 Other income (expense), net. The change in other income (expense), net was primarily related to a 4.3 million derivative loss and a 1.8 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the convertible notes exchange recorded in the third quarter of 2023. See Note 8 for more information. The change also included a decrease due to lower interest income during the periods as well as the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

 Income tax provision . The tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included both foreign income and withholding taxes. No tax benefit was recognized on jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year due to the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. 
 
 Our effective tax rate was 47 and (2) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (5) and (1) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax rate varies from the 21 federal statutory rate primarily due to the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. While our expected tax rate would be 0 due to the full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, the income tax provision and related effective tax rates was due to foreign income and withholding taxes. 
 
 Jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year where no tax benefit can be recognized due to the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets are excluded from the estimated annual federal effective tax rate. The impact of such an exclusion could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter depending on the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 140.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and 44.2 million of working capital as compared to 168.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and 37.3 million of working capital at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily related to the repayment of the outstanding principal of our 2024 Notes of 21.7 million, which matured in May 2024. 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations and potential borrowings under our 50 million credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). In addition, we could access capital markets to supplement our liquidity position. Our material drivers or variants of operating cash flow are net income (loss) and the timing of invoicing and cash collections from our customers. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors and the payments of other liabilities. 
 
 We believe we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our operational requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and coupon interest of our 2027 Notes for the next twelve months. Our future working capital requirements depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, growth of our customer subscription services, future acquisitions we might undertake, expansion into complementary businesses, timing of adoption and implementation of our solutions and customer churn. Capital markets have tightened in response to the macroeconomic environment making new financing more difficult and/or expensive and we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 
 The following table presents key components of our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 3,370 (3,967) Net cash used in investing activities (840) (2,281) Net cash used in financing activities (30,930) (28,269) Effect of foreign currency rates on cash 217 (30) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (28,183) (34,547) 
 
 Operating activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.4 million. The improvement was primarily due to a significant reduction in our net loss. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.8 million. The decrease was mainly due to higher capital expenditures in 2023, primarily related to a third-party software license renewal. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.9 million. The increase of 2.7 million year-over-year was primarily due to the 21.7 million repayment of our 2024 Notes as they matured in May 2024 and higher tax withholding payments of 4.5 million related to the vesting of employee share-based awards. The increase was partially offset by decreases attributable to a 22.8 million purchase of capped call in 2023 in connection with the convertible notes exchange, and 0.8 million of debt issuance costs associated with the execution of our Credit Agreement in 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as variable interest entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

 Credit facility 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, 0.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Credit Agreement is included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, noncurrent in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an insignificant amount of amortization of debt issuance costs which is included in other income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 The Credit Agreement also has a depository condition which requires us to maintain a cash balance of at least 10.0 million with the administrative agent throughout the term of the Credit Agreement. This amount has been included in restricted cash in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The complexity and judgment required in our estimation process, as well as issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, affect the amounts of revenue, expenses, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue. Estimates are also used for, but not limited to, receivables, allowance for credit losses, operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, useful lives of assets, depreciation, income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation, valuation of stock awards, other current liabilities and accrued liabilities. Numerous internal and external factors can affect estimates. Our critical accounting policies related to the estimates and judgments are discussed in our Annual Report under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently aware of any such proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in the Company's risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report. 
 
 We depend on third-party data centers, software, data and other unrelated service providers and any disruption from such third-party providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business. 
 
 Our cloud products are dependent upon third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, including Microsoft Azure, IBM Softlayer and AWS, all of which must interoperate for end users to achieve their computing goals. We utilize third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud platform providers and other service providers to host and deliver our subscription services as well as for our own business operations. We host our cloud products from data centers in a variety of countries. While we control and generally have exclusive access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications and human failures and similar events. They may also be subject to Security Incidents, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite our failover capabilities, standard protocols and other precautions, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, disruptions to the supply chain necessary to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business could impact our service availability and performance. These providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. 
 
 Certain of our applications are essential to our customers ability to quote, price, and/or sell their products and services. Interruption in our service may affect the availability, accuracy or timeliness of quotes, pricing or other information and could require us to issue service credits to our customers, damage our reputation, cause our customers to terminate their use of our solutions, require us to indemnify our customers against certain losses, and prevent us from gaining additional business from current or future customers. In addition, certain of our applications require access to our customers' data which may be held by third parties, some of whom are, or may become, our competitors. For example, many of our travel industry products rely upon access to airline data held by large airline IT providers which compete against certain of our airline products. Certain of these competitors have in the past, and may again in the future, make it difficult for our airline customers to access their data in a timely and/or cost-effective manner. 
 
 We have experienced, and may experience in the future, system disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to third-party data centers, software, data and other service providers, many of which are shared by other SaaS providers. These disruptions could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales and/or cash flows and lead to legal liability and other costs, and the full impact of which may not be immediately known.
