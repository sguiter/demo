segments, which consisted of (i) manufactured home ("MH") communities, (ii) recreational vehicle ("RV") communities, and (iii) Marinas, to a -segment structure that now includes (iv) communities in the United Kingdom ("UK"). The new structure reflects how the chief operating decision maker manages the business, makes operating decisions, allocates resources and evaluates operating performance. Beginning with the three months ended March 31, 2024, we are reporting our financial results consistent with our newly realigned operating segments and have recast prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage our business and monitor segment performance. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial statements and related notes in order to conform to the current period presentation. There was no impact to prior period net income, shareholders' equity or cash flows for any of the reclassifications. 
 
 Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements 
 
 As disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, we restated the unaudited financial information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (collectively, the "2023 Interim Financial Statements"). Accordingly, certain prior period balances within our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been restated, where applicable. 
 
 In 2022, we acquired a portfolio of holiday park properties located in the United Kingdom, which we refer to as our Park Holidays business, classified within our UK reporting segment. As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024, during the course of management's 2023 year-end procedures, we reviewed the controls relating to the valuation of the Park Holidays business and the associated goodwill at March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023. In connection with that review, we concluded that there were triggering events relevant to the valuation of the Park Holidays business, including reduced financial projections and a higher weighted average cost of capital due to increases in interest rates, that should have been taken into account when preparing the 2023 Interim Financial Statements. Management undertook a full review of the valuations and determined that at each of March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, we should have recognized non-cash impairments to goodwill for the Park Holidays business.

 In addition, in September 2024, we sold development properties in the U.S. for total consideration of million and recorded a gain on sale of million. The development properties were previously classified as held for sale. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized asset impairment charges of million within the MH segment to reduce the carrying value of the properties to an aggregate fair value of million, driven by our change in strategic plan for these properties. The fair value measurement was determined using an income approach and Level 3 inputs based on a probability weighted holding period and estimated sale price for the assets. The asset impairment charges were recorded within Asset impairments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 2023 Disposition Activity 
 
 In August 2023, we sold MH community located in Maine with developed sites at its net carrying value for cash consideration of million. The property was previously classified as held for sale during the three months ended June 30, 2023, with its net carrying value of million written down by million within Asset impairments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, to a fair value less cost to sell of million. 
 
 In February 2023, we sold parcels of land in the United Kingdom for total consideration of million. The consideration consisted of million in the form of an operator note receivable that was added to an existing facility with a weighted average interest rate of per annum, due May 31, 2023 and subsequently extended to July 31, 2023 as part of the operator's total facility. On the date of sale, the carrying value of the note receivable approximated its fair value due to its short term nature. The dispositions resulted in a loss on sale totaling million during the year ended December 31, 2023, net of the release of foreign currency translation losses from Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") of million. The total loss on sale was recorded in Gain / (loss) on dispositions of properties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2023, we have reacquired these parcels of land at fair value as part of the settlement of the related note receivable, with remeasurement gain or loss recognized. Refer to Note 4, "Notes and Other Receivables," for additional information on the settlement of the notes receivable.

 million (gross installment notes receivable of million less fair value adjustment of million) and million (gross installment notes receivable of million less fair value adjustment of million) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are secured by manufactured homes. The notes represent financing to purchasers of manufactured homes located in our communities and require monthly principal and interest payments. The notes had a net weighted average interest rate (net of servicing costs) and maturity of and years as of September 30, 2024, and and years as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 16, "Fair Value Measurements," for additional details. 
 
 Notes Receivable from Real Estate Developers and Operators 
 
 Notes receivable from real estate developers and operators are measured at fair value, using indicative pricing models from third party valuation specialists, in accordance with ASC 820, " Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. " Refer to Note 16, "Fair Value Measurements," for additional information. 
 
 Note Receivable from a Real Estate Operator 
 
 The note receivable from a real estate operator was comprised of a fully drawn loan provided to Royale Holdings Group HoldCo Limited, a real estate development owner and operator in the United Kingdom, and certain other parties, to fund investing and financing activities (the "Note"). The Note was collateralized by a first-priority security interest in real estate assets and MH manufacturers in the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2024, there was remaining balance due on the note receivable. 
 
 After the maturity date of July 31, 2023, the Note became past due. On September 29, 2023, we appointed receivers over the real estate assets. The receivers marketed the real estate assets for sale during the fourth quarter of 2023. Upon completion of the marketing process, on December 28, 2023, we appointed administrators over the real estate assets and acquired such assets through a credit bid. During the fourth quarter, we engaged third party valuation specialists to appraise the real estate assets in accordance with ASC 820. The appraisals were completed using the discounted cash flow method (income approach), with the significant assumptions being development density, estimated absorption rate, home sale price and discount rate. The real estate assets appraised at fair value totaling million. The Note balance was reduced by this amount, with an offsetting adjustment to Investment property, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the balance remaining on the Note, which was in nonaccrual status, collateralized by a first-priority security interest in MH manufacturers in the United Kingdom, was adjusted to fair value totaling million (gross notes receivable of million, inclusive of accrued interest of million, less a fair value adjustment of million). The note had a weighted average interest rate of as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we completed a receivership process related to the MH manufacturers in the United Kingdom. The receivers sold such assets for a total consideration of million, resulting in cash proceeds to the Company of million, net of non-cash consideration and fees. The sale of these assets resulted in an incremental fair value remeasurement adjustment of million that was recorded in Loss on remeasurement of notes receivable on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Notes Receivable from Real Estate Developers 
 
 Other acquisition and construction loans provided to real estate developers total million with a net weighted average interest rate and maturity of and years as of September 30, 2024, and total million with a net weighted average interest rate and maturity of and years as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the additional acquisition and construction loans provided to real estate developers had million and million of undrawn funds, respectively. There were adjustments to the fair value of notes receivable from real estate developers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023.

million from the third-party servicer, in exchange for relinquishing our right, title and interest in the receivables. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received a subsequent cash payment of million from the servicer in accordance with the terms of the transfer. We have no further obligations or rights with respect to the control, management, administration, servicing or collection of the installment notes receivables. However, we are subject to certain recourse provisions requiring us to purchase the underlying manufactured homes collateralizing such notes at a price calculated based on the agreed upon terms, in the event of a note default and subsequent repossession of the home by the unrelated entity. The recourse provisions are considered to be a form of continuing involvement which precluded establishing legal isolation, and therefore these transferred loans do not meet the requirements for sale accounting under ASC 860, " Transfers and Servicing ." 
 
 The transaction has been accounted for in accordance with ASC 860-30, with the transferred assets classified as Collateralized receivables, net and the cash proceeds received from this transaction classified as Secured borrowings on collateralized receivables within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have elected to apply the fair value option to the collateralized receivables and related secured borrowings under ASC 820, " Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ." The balance of collateralized receivables was million (gross collateralized receivable of million less fair value adjustments of million) and million (gross collateralized receivable of million less fair value adjustments of million) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The balance of secured borrowings on collateralized receivables was million (gross secured borrowings of million plus fair value adjustments of million) and million (gross secured borrowings of million plus fair value adjustments of million) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The notes represent financing to purchasers of manufactured homes located in our communities and require monthly principal and interest payments. The notes had a net weighted average interest rate and maturity of and years as of September 30, 2024 and and years as of December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 16, "Fair Value Measurements," for additional details. 
 
 The collateralized receivables earn interest income and the secured borrowings accrue interest expense at the same amount. The amount of interest income and interest expense recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively.

 (1) In January 2024, the Operating Partnership issued million of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of and a term, due January 15, 2029 (the "2029 Notes"). Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2024. The net proceeds from the offering were million, after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses. We used the majority of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 Line of Credit 
 
 The Operating Partnership (as borrower), SUI (as guarantor), and certain lenders are parties to a credit agreement which governs our senior credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"). 
 
 Prior to March 2024, the aggregate amount of our Senior Credit Facility was billion with the ability to upsize the total borrowings by an additional million, subject to certain conditions. The aggregate amount under the Senior Credit Facility consisted of the following: (a) a revolving loan in an amount up to billion and (b) a term loan facility of billion, with the ability to draw funds from the combined facilities in U.S. dollars, pound sterling, euros, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars, subject to certain limitations. The maturity date of the revolving loan facility is April 7, 2026. At our option that maturity date may be extended additional periods. 
 
 In March 2024, we terminated the term loan facility and settled the associated billion of borrowings outstanding under the term loan by increasing our borrowings under the revolving loan of the Senior Credit Facility. By terminating the term loan, we reduced our aggregate borrowing capacity under the Senior Credit Facility to billion under the revolving loan. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recognized a Loss on extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statements of Operations of million related to the termination of the term loan facility. In June 2024, we amended the Senior Credit Facility to replace the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate with the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average ("CORRA") as the benchmark rate for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, with no other significant changes to the terms of the Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate based on the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, the Australian Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate ("BBSY"), the Daily Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA") Rate or the CORRA, as applicable, plus a margin, in all cases, which can range from to , subject to certain adjustments. As of September 30, 2024, the margins based on our credit ratings were on the revolving loan facility. 
 
 At the lenders' option, the Senior Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable upon an event of default under the Credit Facility Agreement. We had billion and million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The balance is recorded in Unsecured debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The Senior Credit Facility provides us with the ability to issue letters of credit. Our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility, but does reduce the borrowing amount available. We had million and million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The term loan initially had a term ending October 29, 2023, and bore interest at a floating rate based on the Eurodollar rate or Prime rate plus a margin ranging from to . Effective July 1, 2021, we amended the agreement to release the associated collateral, extend the term loan facility maturity date to October 29, 2025 and adjust the interest rate margin to a range from to . In August 2022, we amended the unsecured term loan facility to transition from the Eurodollar rate to SOFR. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we settled the term loan facility and had balance outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The outstanding balance was million at December 31, 2023 and was recorded in Unsecured debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Covenants 
 
 The mortgage term loans, senior unsecured notes and Senior Credit Facility are subject to various financial and other covenants. The most restrictive covenants are pursuant to (a) the terms of the Senior Credit Facility, which contains a maximum leverage ratio, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum secured leverage ratio, and (b) the terms of the senior unsecured notes, which contain a total debt to total assets ratio, secured debt to total assets ratio, consolidated income available for debt service to debt service ratio and unencumbered total asset value to unsecured debt ratio. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 
 In addition, certain of our subsidiary borrowers own properties that secure loans. These subsidiaries are consolidated within our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, however, each of these subsidiaries' assets and credit are not available to satisfy our debts and other obligations, or any of our other subsidiaries or any other person or entity.

of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. In addition, a REIT must distribute annually at least of its REIT taxable income (calculated without any deduction for dividends paid and excluding capital gains) to its shareholders and meet other tests. 
 
 Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements (on an annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition, frequent changes occur in the area of REIT taxation, which requires us to continually monitor our tax status. We analyzed the various REIT tests and confirmed that we continued to qualify as a REIT during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on the ordinary taxable income we distribute to our shareholders as dividends. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income could be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local income taxes, as well as U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. We are also subject to local income taxes in Canada, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom due to certain properties located in those jurisdictions. We do not provide for withholding taxes on our undistributed earnings from our Canadian subsidiaries as they are reinvested and will continue to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S. As currently structured, we are not subject to United Kingdom withholding taxes on distributions from our United Kingdom properties. 
 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured after considering all available evidence. Our temporary differences primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards, depreciation, interest and basis differences between tax and GAAP. Our deferred tax assets that have a full valuation allowance relate to our taxable REIT subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, we had million of net deferred tax liabilities, comprised of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance of million, and deferred tax liabilities of million. The deferred tax liability balance is comprised primarily of basis differences in our foreign investment in properties in the United Kingdom and Canada. As of December 31, 2023, we had million of net deferred tax liabilities, comprised of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance of million, and deferred tax liabilities of million. The net deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recorded within Other assets, net and Other liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded current tax benefit for federal, state, Canadian, Puerto Rican, and United Kingdom income taxes totaling million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded current tax expense for federal, state, Canadian, Puerto Rican, and United Kingdom income taxes totaling million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded current tax expense for federal, state, Canadian, Puerto Rican, and United Kingdom income taxes and Australian withholding taxes totaling million and million, respectively.

and derivative contracts, respectively, which have each been designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815, " Derivatives and Hedging ." The risks being hedged are the interest rate risk related to outstanding floating rate debt and forecasted debt issuance transactions, and the benchmark interest rates used are the SOFR and the SONIA Rate. The unrealized gains or losses on the derivative instruments are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified to Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We estimate that million will be reclassified as a reduction to Interest expense over the next 12 months for all of our outstanding cash flow hedges. Cash flow from these derivative instruments is classified in the same category as the cash flow items being hedged on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 We utilize fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The following methods and assumptions were used in order to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 
 The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate their fair market values due to the short-term nature of the instruments. These are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. 
 
 Installment Notes Receivable on Manufactured Homes and Collateralized Receivables 
 
 Installment notes receivable on manufactured homes are recorded at fair value and are measured using model-derived indicative pricing using primarily unobservable inputs, inclusive of default rates, interest rates and recovery rates (Level 3). Refer to Note 4, "Notes and Other Receivables," and Note 5, "Collateralized Receivables and Transfers of Financial Assets," for additional information. 
 
 Notes Receivable from Real Estate Developers and Operators 
 
 Notes receivable from real estate developers and operators are recorded at fair value and are measured using model-derived indicative pricing using primarily unobservable inputs including interest rates and counterparty performance (Level 3). The carrying values of the notes generally approximate their fair market values either due to the nature of the note and / or the note being secured primarily by underlying real estate and other collateral and / or personal guarantees. Refer to Note 4, "Notes and Other Receivables," for additional information. 
 
 Derivative Assets and Liabilities - Interest Rate Derivatives 
 
 Interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value and consist of interest rate swaps and forward swaps. The fair value of these financial instruments are measured using observable inputs based on the SOFR and SONIA Rates, respectively (Level 2).

 Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates. The fair value estimates are based on information available as of September 30, 2024. As such, our estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the actual carrying value. 

other large MH operators in the U.S. The complaint alleges that the defendants have violated federal antitrust laws by sharing and receiving competitively sensitive non-public information to maintain artificially high site rents. The complaints have been consolidated into the case captioned In re Manufactured Home Lot Rents Antitrust Litigation, No. 1:23-cv-06715. 
 
 Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary damages, as well as attorneys' fees. We are unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in this litigation. If an unfavorable result were to occur, it is possible that the impact could be material to our results of operations in the periods in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. 
 
 We believe that the plaintiffs' allegations are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that our defense of this litigation will be successful. 
 
 Other Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. All such proceedings, taken together, are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

 Hurricane Ian - When Hurricane Ian made landfall on Florida's western coast in September 2022, the storm primarily affected properties in the Fort Myers area, comprising approximately sites. These properties sustained significant flooding and wind damage from the hurricane. At other affected MH and RV properties, most of the damage was limited to trees, roofs, fences, skirting and carports. At affected marina properties, docks, buildings and landscaping sustained wind and water damage. We maintain property, casualty, flood and business interruption insurance for our community portfolio, subject to customary deductibles and limits. 
 
 Estimated property insurance recoveries, excluding business interruption recoveries, of million related to Hurricane Ian were recorded in Notes and other receivables, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024.

 We are actively working with our insurance providers on claims for business interruption recoveries. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized million, net of deductibles, for lost earnings from Hurricane Ian covering the period from September 1, 2023 through January 31, 2024. The business interruption proceeds were recorded within Brokerage commissions and other, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The related communities are under redevelopment and we have gradually started to lease developed sites at these communities to customers. However, we currently cannot estimate a date when operating results will be restored to pre-hurricane levels. Our business interruption insurance policy provides for up to 60 months of coverage from the date of restoration. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received an insurance recovery of million in excess of previously estimated costs related to damages incurred at certain marinas due to Hurricane Ian. The insurance recovery gain was recorded within Catastrophic event-related charges, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, along with our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 We are a fully integrated REIT. As of September 30, 2024, we owned and operated, directly or indirectly, or had an interest in, a portfolio of 659 developed properties located in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom including 288 MH communities, 179 RV communities, 138 marinas, and 54 UK communities. 
 
 We have been in the business of operating, acquiring, developing and expanding MH and RV communities since 1975, marinas since 2020, and communities in the United Kingdom since 2022. We lease individual parcels of land, or sites, with utility access for the placement of manufactured homes and RVs to our MH, RV and UK customers. Our MH communities are designed to offer affordable housing to individuals and families, while also providing certain amenities. In the U.S., we are also engaged in the marketing, selling and leasing of new and pre-owned homes to current and future residents in our MH communities. The rental program operations within our MH communities support and enhance our occupancy levels, property performance and cash flows. Our RV communities are designed to offer affordable vacation opportunities to individuals and families complemented by a diverse selection of high-quality amenities. The majority of our marinas are concentrated in coastal regions. Our marinas offer wet slip and dry storage space leases, end-to-end service (such as routine maintenance, repair and winterization), fuel sales and other high-end amenities. These services and amenities offer convenience and resort-quality experiences to our members and guests. In the United Kingdom, our UK communities are referred to as "holiday parks" and are located predominantly at irreplaceable seaside destinations in the south of England. We provide holiday home sales and associated site license activities to holiday homeowners in our communities. 
 
 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 We have identified significant accounting policies that, as a result of the judgments, uncertainties and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Details regarding significant accounting policies are described fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in our "Results of Operations" below, we have provided information regarding net operating income ("NOI") and funds from operations ("FFO") as supplemental performance measures. We believe NOI and FFO are appropriate measures given their wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts following the real estate industry. NOI provides a measure of rental operations and does not factor in depreciation, amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation / amortization of real estate assets. In addition, NOI and FFO are commonly used in various ratios, pricing multiples / yields and returns and valuation calculations used to measure financial position, performance and value. 
 
 NOI 
 
 Total Portfolio NOI - NOI is derived from property operating revenues minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. We use NOI as a key measure when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and / or groups of properties. The principal limitation of NOI is that it excludes depreciation, amortization, interest expense and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses, all of which are significant costs. Therefore, NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties rather than of the Company overall. We believe that NOI provides enhanced comparability for investor evaluation of properties' performance and growth over time. 

43 

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

 We believe that GAAP net income (loss) is the most directly comparable measure to NOI. NOI should not be considered to be an alternative to GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of our financial performance or GAAP cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Because of the inclusion of items such as interest, depreciation and amortization, the use of GAAP net income (loss) as a performance measure is limited as these items may not accurately reflect the actual change in market value of a property, in the case of depreciation and in the case of interest, may not necessarily be linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset, as it is often incurred at a parent company level and not at a property level. 
 
 Same Property NOI - This is a management tool used when evaluating the performance and growth of our Same Property portfolio. We define same properties as those we have owned and operated continuously since January 1, 2023. Same properties exclude ground-up development properties, acquired properties and properties sold after December 31, 2022. The Same Property data may change from time-to-time depending on acquisitions, dispositions, management discretion, significant transactions or unique situations. Same Property NOI does not include the revenues and expenses related to home sales, and service, retail, dining and entertainment activities at the properties. We believe that Same Property NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental comparative performance measure of the income generated from the Same Property portfolio from one period to the next. 
 
 FFO 
 
 FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit") as GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairments of certain real estate assets and investments, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. By excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, real estate related to impairment and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not readily apparent from GAAP net income (loss). Management believes the use of FFO has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. 
 
 Core FFO - In addition, we use FFO excluding certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business ("Core FFO"). 
 
 We believe that FFO and Core FFO provide enhanced comparability for investor evaluations of period-over-period results. We believe that GAAP net income (loss) is the most directly comparable measure to FFO. The principal limitation of FFO is that it does not replace GAAP net income (loss) as a financial performance measure or GAAP cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Because FFO excludes significant economic components of GAAP net income (loss) including depreciation and amortization, FFO should be used as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) and not as an alternative to it. Furthermore, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT's ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital. FFO is calculated in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by Nareit, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that interpret the Nareit definition differently.

 Seasonality of Revenue 
 
 The RV, Marina, and UK segments are seasonal and the results of operations in any one period may not be indicative of results in future periods. 
 
 In the RV segment, certain properties maintain higher occupancy during the summer months, while other properties maintain higher occupancy during the winter months. Based on the location of our properties with transient RV sites, our portfolio generally produces higher revenues between April and September than between October and March. In the UK segment, vacation rental sites generally produce higher revenues between March and October. Through September 30, 2024, we recognized aggregate Real property - transient revenue from our RV and UK segments of 37.7 million in the first quarter, 81.7 million in the second quarter and 138.2 million in the third quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized Real property - transient revenue as follows: 
 
 Real property - transient revenue (in millions) During the Three Months Ended Year March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 Total 2023 321.4 12.4 27.8 47.3 12.5 100.0 
 
 In the Marina segment, the majority of our wet slip and dry storage space leases have annual terms that are billed seasonally. Wet slip storage increases during the summer months for the boating season, whereas dry storage increases during the winter season as weather patterns require boat owners to store their vessels on dry docks or within covered racks. Through September 30, 2024, we recognized seasonal real property revenue of 78.1 million in the first quarter, 95.9 million in the second quarter and 104.4 million in the third quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized seasonal real property revenue as follows:

 Real Property Operations - North America Same Property Portfolio 
 
 Same Property refers to properties that we have owned for at least the preceding year, exclusive of properties recently completed or under construction, and other properties as determined by management. The Same Property data may change from time-to-time depending on acquisitions, dispositions, management discretion, significant transactions or unique situations. In order to evaluate the growth of the Same Property portfolio, management has classified certain items differently than our GAAP statement. The reclassification difference between our GAAP statements and our Same Property portfolio is the reclassification of utility revenues from real property revenue to operating expenses. Additionally, prior period Canadian currency figures have been translated at 2024 average exchange rates for constant currency comparability. 
 
 The following tables reflect certain financial and other information for our Same Property MH, RV and Marina portfolios as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions, except for statistical information):

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 29.2 decrease in NOI is primarily driven by a 21.1 decrease in total home sales volume as compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by a 1.7 increase in average selling price.

 Service, retail, dining and entertainment, net - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased primarily due to lower transient demand in the RV and Marina segments leading to a reduction in revenue generation from service, retail, dining and entertainment activities, as well as increased costs related to service and retail activities in our Marina segment. 
 
 Interest income - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased primarily due to having a lower receivable balance outstanding with real estate operators than during the same period in 2023. Refer to Note 4, "Notes and Other Receivables," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Brokerage commissions and other, net - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased primarily due to a decrease in business interruption insurance recoveries recognized in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, a decrease in the number of brokered home sales reducing total brokerage commissions as compared to the same period in 2023, and a decrease in dividend income as a result of the sale of our publicly traded marketable securities in Ingenia in 2023. Refer to Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

 General and administrative expense - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to a charge of 8.9 million to write off a receivable balance related to expected insurance proceeds from a litigation matter, non-recurring transaction costs related to the settlement of a loan provided to a real estate operator, and increased expenses related to consulting fees and ERP system implementation costs as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Catastrophic event-related charges, net - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to charges of 3.9 million for impaired assets and storm-related damages at two MH communities, three RV communities, and nine marinas due to Hurricane Helene, and incremental asset impairment and debris removal charges, net of insurance recoveries, of 5.6 million driven by flooding at an RV community in New Hampshire. 
 
 Asset impairments - for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased due to asset impairment charges related to non-continuing expansion and development properties as well as the write off of other financial assets within our MH and UK segments in 2024.

 Goodwill impairment - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no goodwill impairment charges, as compared to charges of 44.8 million and 369.9 million driven by a decline in the fair value of the UK reporting segment during the same periods in 2023. Refer to Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Interest expense - for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased due to a higher debt balance and higher weighted average interest rate as compared to the same periods in 2023. Refer to Note 9, "Debt and Line of Credit," of our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Gain / (loss) on remeasurement of marketable securities - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was zero due to the sale of our publicly traded marketable securities in Ingenia in 2023, as compared to a gain of 6.1 million and loss of 8.0 million during the same periods in 2023, respectively. 
 
 Gain / (loss) on dispositions of properties - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a gain of 178.7 million and 186.6 million on the sale of 11 properties, respectively, as compared to a loss of 0.7 million and 2.9 million on the sale of two land parcels and one MH property during the same periods in 2023, respectively.

 Other income / (expense), net - for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was an expense 0.8 million as compared to an expense of 3.7 million during the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher long-term lease termination expenses during the prior period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other income / (expense), net was a gain of 5.6 million, as compared to an expense of 5.5 million during the same period in 2023, primarily due to a litigation settlement gain of 10.3 million related to our Marina segment in 2024, as compared to higher long-term lease termination expenses during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Income from nonconsolidated affiliates - for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to the improved performance of our nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily driven by the Sungenia joint venture. Refer to Note 7, "Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Gain / (loss) on remeasurement of investment in nonconsolidated affiliates - for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a gain of 6.5 million as compared to a loss of 4.5 million during the same period in 2023 due to the fluctuation in the fair value of a notes receivable portfolio held at our GTSC joint venture. Refer to Note 7, "Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Current tax benefit / (expense) - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a benefit of 0.9 million and expense of 6.5 million, respectively, compared to an expense of 4.6 million and 13.9 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2023, primarily due to tax planning efforts at our UK operations in 2024 and taxes accrued in the UK in 2023 driven by property dispositions. 
 
 Deferred tax benefit - for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to timing differences for book and tax purposes at our UK and Canadian operations. Refer to Note 13, "Income Taxes," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Short-term Liquidity 
 
 Our principal short-term liquidity demands historically have been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to our shareholders and the unit holders of the Operating Partnership, property acquisitions, development and expansion of our properties, capital improvement of our properties, the purchase of new and pre-owned homes, and debt repayment. We intend to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash balances, cash flow generated from operations, draws on our Senior Credit Facility, and the use of debt and equity offerings under our shelf registration statement. Refer to Note 9, "Debt and Line of Credit," and Note 10, "Equity and Temporary Equity," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 We intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by focusing on our core fundamentals, which are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. We take a disciplined approach to selecting the optimal mix of financing sources to meet our liquidity demands and minimize our overall cost of capital. Our investment grade credit ratings remain unchanged from the initial rating. We plan to continue to capitalize on our unsecured bond market access to optimize our cost of capital and increase our financial flexibility. 
 
 Current market and economic conditions, including relating to, among other things, interest rates, currency fluctuations, equity valuations and inflation, may adversely affect our ability to obtain debt and equity capital in the short term on attractive terms. 
 
 Since our initial public offering in 1993, we have demonstrated operational reliability and cash flow strength throughout economic cycles. Our current objectives include streamlining our operations with an emphasis on our reliable real property income. We recognize the headwinds we are facing from a challenging macroeconomic environment and are re-aligning our strategy to focus on our proven, durable income streams. We are positioned for ongoing organic growth with expected rental rate increases, occupancy gains and expense management. In 2024, we expect rental rate growth that exceeds headline inflation with ongoing focus on expense management to continue generating strong organic cash flow growth. 
 
 Given a macroeconomic backdrop of sustained higher interest rates, we intend to prioritize debt reduction as our primary use of free cash flow from our operations and of proceeds from equity issuances and selective capital recycling. In addition, we are reducing our development activity considering the more challenging macroeconomic and capital market environment. Capital spending besides projects that are underway will be solely focused on the most strategic opportunities. We also attempt to manage interest rate risks by using interest rate hedging instruments and by monitoring our overall leverage levels. We engage in certain hedging transactions to limit our exposure from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on borrowing costs of our loans. 
 
 Acquisitions, Dispositions, Development and Expansion Activities 
 
 Subject to market conditions, we intend to selectively identify opportunities to expand our development pipeline and acquire existing properties. We finance acquisitions through available cash, secured financing, draws on our Senior Credit Facility, the assumption of existing debt on properties and the issuance of debt and equity securities. The current higher interest rate environment makes it more expensive to finance acquisitions and fund developments and expansions. We will continue to very selectively pursue acquisition and development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired three marinas and three marina expansion assets with an aggregate of 925 wet slips and dry storage spaces for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 63.8 million. In conjunction with two of the marina acquisitions, we issued an aggregate of 262,599 common OP units as part of the consideration transferred. During the same period, we entered into a ground lease that can support one marina with eight wet slips and dry storage spaces. 
 
 We have commenced a targeted disposition program to divest non-strategic assets in an effort to simplify management and reduce our overall leverage. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 10 MH properties, one UK property, and two development properties with an aggregate of 3,409 sites for a gross sale price of approximately 392.2 million, and received total cash consideration of approximately 287.0 million, net of settlement of the associated mortgage debt of 93.5 million. The net proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired two land parcels located in the U.S. for an aggregate purchase price of 12.9 million. The parcels can accommodate the potential development of over 1,100 sites. We also acquired one land parcel, previously subject to a ground lease, located in the U.K. for an aggregate purchase price of 9.6 million. We also expanded one of our existing communities by nearly 30 sites and delivered nearly 100 sites at two ground-up development properties. 

58 

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

 We will selectively expand our properties utilizing our inventory of owned and entitled land. We have 18,190 MH and RV sites suitable for future development. 
 
 Refer to Note 3, "Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on acquisitions and dispositions completed to date. 
 
 Capital Expenditures (excluding Acquisition Costs) 
 
 Our capital expenditures include lot modifications, growth projects, rebranding, acquisition-related capital expenditures, expansion and development construction costs, rental home purchases and recurring capital expenditures. 
 
 Our capital expenditure activity is summarized as follows (in millions): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Recurring Capital Expenditures 89.0 61.0 Non-Recurring Capital Expenditures and Related Activities Lot modifications 27.0 41.3 Growth projects 78.6 81.5 Rebranding 3.0 3.9 Capital improvements to recent acquisitions 68.8 168.2 Expansion and development 105.2 232.0 Rental program 121.2 201.4 Other (3.0) 1.0 Total Non-Recurring Capital Expenditure and Related Activities 400.8 729.3 Total Capital Expenditure and Related Activities 489.8 790.3 
 
 Recurring Capital Expenditures 
 
 Property recurring capital expenditures are necessary to maintain asset quality, including purchasing and replacing items used to operate the communities and marinas. Recurring capital expenditures at our MH, RV and UK properties include major road, driveway and pool improvements; clubhouse renovations; adding or replacing streetlights; playground equipment; signage; maintenance facilities; manager housing and property vehicles. Recurring capital expenditures at our marinas include dredging, dock repairs and improvements, and equipment maintenance and upgrades. The minimum capitalized amount is five hundred dollars. 
 
 Non-Recurring Capital Expenditures and Related Activities 
 
 Lot modifications - consist of expenditures incurred to modify the foundational structures required to set a new home after a previous home has been removed. These expenditures are necessary to create a revenue stream from a new site renter and often improve the quality of the community. Other lot modification expenditures include land improvements added to annual RV sites to aid in the conversion of transient RV guests to annual contracts. 
 
 Growth projects - consist of revenue generating or expense reducing activities at the properties. These include, but are not limited to, utility efficiency and renewable energy projects, site, slip or amenity upgrades such as the addition of a garage, shed or boat lift, and other special capital projects that substantiate an incremental rental increase. 
 
 Rebranding - includes new signage at our RV communities and the costs of building an RV mobile application and updated website. 
 
 Capital improvements to recent acquisitions - often require 24 to 36 months to complete after closing and include upgrading clubhouses; landscaping; new street light systems; new mail delivery systems; pool renovations including larger decks, heaters and furniture; new maintenance facilities; lot modifications; and new signage including main signs and internal road signs. 
 
 Expansion and development expenditures - consist primarily of construction costs such as roads, activities, and amenities, and costs necessary to complete site improvements, such as driveways, sidewalks and landscaping at our MH, RV and UK communities. Expenditures also include costs to rebuild after damage has been incurred at MH, RV, marina or UK properties, and research and development.

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

 Rental program - consists of investment in the acquisition of homes intended for the rental program and the purchase of vacation rental homes at our RV communities. Expenditures for these investments depend upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales, rental homes and vacation rental homes. 
 
 Cash Flow Activities 
 
 Our cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities 743.0 672.9 Net Cash Used For Investing Activities (165.6) (817.8) Net Cash Provided By / (Used For) Financing Activities (538.9) 116.3 Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 0.6 0.2 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by 39.1 million from 42.7 million as of December 31, 2023, to 81.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 70.1 million to 743.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 672.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to beneficial changes in inventory, other assets, and other liabilities, and improved Same Property operating performance at our MH properties, marinas, and UK properties, partially offset by reduced operating performance at our RV properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 Our net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things: 
 
 the market and economic conditions in our current markets generally, and specifically in the metropolitan areas of our current markets; 
 lower occupancy and rental rates of our properties; 
 substantial increases in insurance premiums; 
 increases in other operating costs, such as wage and benefit costs, supplies and repairs, real estate taxes and utilities; 
 decreased sales of manufactured homes; 
 current volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets; and 
 the effects of outbreaks of disease and related restrictions on business operations. 
 
 See "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Investing activities - Net cash used for investing activities decreased by 652.2 million to 165.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 817.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Net cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in cash deployed to invest in existing properties and proceeds received from the disposition of 10 MH properties, one UK property, and two development properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for detail on the net cash used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 3, "Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on acquisitions and investment activity. 
 
 Financing activities - Net cash used for financing activities was 538.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 116.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in Net cash provided by / (used for) financing activities was primarily driven by cash disbursed to settle mortgage debt and repay borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the net issuance of debt during the corresponding period in 2023, as part of our strategy to optimize the strength of our balance sheet. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for detail on the net cash provided by / (used for) financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 9, "Debt and Line of Credit," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

 We are exposed to interest rate variability associated with our outstanding floating rate debt and any maturing debt that has to be refinanced. Interest rate movements impact our borrowing costs and, while as of September 30, 2024, approximately 94 of our total debt was fixed rate financing, including the impact of hedge activity, increases in interest costs are likely to adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 Equity and Debt Activity 
 
 At the Market Offering Sales Agreement 
 
 During May 2024, we renewed our 2021 ATM with certain sales agents and forward sellers pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate gross sales price of 1.25 billion of our common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into forward sale agreements with respect to 2,713,571 shares of common stock under the ATM. We completed the physical settlement of these shares for an aggregate gross sales price of 364.3 million and received net proceeds of 361.7 million, or 133.31 per share. The net proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility. Through September 30, 2024, we had entered into and settled forward sales agreements under the ATM for an aggregate gross sales price of 524.8 million, leaving 725.2 million available for sale under the ATM. 
 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding our outstanding senior unsecured notes (in millions, except for statistical information). All senior unsecured notes include interest payments on a semi-annual basis in arrears. 
 
 Carrying Amount Principal Amount September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 5.5 notes, issued in January 2024 and due in January 2029 (1)

 750.0 743.2 742.4 Total 2,700.0 2,675.5 2,177.5 
 (1) In January 2024, the Operating Partnership issued 500.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 5.5 and a five-year term, due January 15, 2029 (the "2029 Notes"). Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2024. The net proceeds from the offering were 495.4 million, after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses. We used the majority of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 The obligations of the Operating Partnership to pay principal, premiums, if any, and interest on our senior unsecured notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by Sun Communities, Inc. The guarantee is full and unconditional, and the Operating Partnership is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, as amended, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by its parent company are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company's consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is "full and unconditional" and, subject to certain exceptions, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership have not been presented. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi), we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership as the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Operating Partnership are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and not provide incremental value to investors. 
 
 Line of Credit 
 
 The Operating Partnership (as borrower), SUI (as guarantor), and certain lenders are parties to a credit agreement which governs our Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 Prior to March 2024, the aggregate amount of our Senior Credit Facility was 4.2 billion with the ability to upsize the total borrowings by an additional 800.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The aggregate amount under the Senior Credit Facility consisted of the following: (a) a revolving loan in an amount up to 3.05 billion and (b) a term loan facility of 1.15 billion, with the ability to draw funds from the combined facilities in U.S. dollars, pound sterling, euros, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars, subject to certain limitations. The maturity date of the revolving loan facility is April 7, 2026. At our option that maturity date may be extended two additional six-month periods. 

61 

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

 In March 2024, we terminated the term loan facility and settled the associated 1.1 billion of borrowings outstanding under the term loan by increasing our borrowings under the revolving loan of the Senior Credit Facility. By terminating the term loan, we reduced our aggregate borrowing capacity under the Senior Credit Facility to 3.05 billion under the revolving loan. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recognized a Loss on extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statements of Operations of 0.6 million related to the termination of the term loan facility. In June 2024, we amended the Senior Credit Facility to replace the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate with the CORRA as the benchmark rate for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, with no other significant changes to the terms of the Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate based on the Adjusted Term SOFR, the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, the Australian BBSY, the Daily SONIA Rate or the CORRA, as applicable, plus a margin, in all cases, which can range from 0.725 to 1.6 , subject to certain adjustments. As of September 30, 2024, the margins based on our credit ratings were 0.85 on the revolving loan facility. 
 
 At the lenders' option, the Senior Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable upon an event of default under the Credit Facility Agreement. We had 1.3 billion and 944.1 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The balance is recorded in Unsecured debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The Senior Credit Facility provides us with the ability to issue letters of credit. Our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility, but does reduce the borrowing amount available. We had 11.3 million and 26.2 million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Financial Covenants 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Credit Facility, we are subject to various financial and other covenants. The most restrictive financial covenants for the Senior Credit Facility are as follows: 
 
 Covenant Requirement As of September 30, 2024 
 Maximum leverage ratio 1.40 2.86 Maximum secured leverage ratio 
 In addition, we are required to maintain the following covenants with respect to the senior unsecured notes payable: 
 
 Covenant Requirement As of September 30, 2024 
 Total debt to total assets 60.0 38.2 Secured debt to total assets 40.0 17.7 Consolidated income available for debt service to debt service 1.50 4.10 Unencumbered total asset value to total unsecured debt 150.0 378.7 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the above covenants and do not anticipate that we will be unable to meet these covenants in the near term. 
 
 Derivative Transactions 
 
 We enter into treasury rate lock contracts, interest rate swaps, and forward swaps for interest rate risk management purposes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The risks being hedged are the interest rate risk related to outstanding floating rate debt and forecasted debt issuance transactions, and the benchmark interest rates used are the SOFR and the SONIA Rate. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into five interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of 150.0 million to hedge interest rate risk associated with a future debt offering. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, we settled seven forward swap contracts totaling 255.0 million and paid a net settlement payment of 2.3 million to several counterparties. Refer to Note 15, "Derivative Financial Instruments," in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Long-term Financing and Capital Requirements 
 
 Long-term Financing 
 
 We anticipate meeting our long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions, expansion and development of properties, other nonrecurring capital improvements and Operating Partnership unit redemptions through long-term unsecured and secured debt and the issuance of certain debt or equity securities subject to market conditions. If current market and economic conditions, including relating to, among other things, interest rates, currency fluctuations, equity valuations and inflation, continue or worsen, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital in the long term on attractive terms may be adversely affected. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had unrestricted cash on hand of 63.6 million, 1.8 billion of remaining capacity on the Senior Credit Facility, and a total of 510 unencumbered MH, RV, marina and UK properties. 
 
 From time to time, we may also issue shares of our capital stock, issue equity units in our Operating Partnership, issue unsecured notes, obtain other debt financing or sell selected assets. Our ability to finance our long-term liquidity requirements in such a manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the MH, RV and marina industries at the time, including the availability and cost of mortgage debt, our financial condition, the operating history of the properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional and local economic conditions. When it becomes necessary for us to approach the credit markets, the volatility in those markets could make borrowing more difficult to secure, more expensive or effectively unavailable. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or more expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing unsecured debt as maturities become due. See "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report. If we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net debt to enterprise value was 28.8 (assuming conversion of all common and preferred OP units to shares of common stock). Our debt has a weighted average interest rate of 4.07 and a weighted average years to maturity of 6.4. 
 
 Capital Requirements 
 
 Certain of our nonconsolidated affiliates, which are accounted for under the equity-method of accounting, have incurred debt. We have not guaranteed the debt of our nonconsolidated affiliates in the arrangements referenced below, nor do we have any obligations to fund this debt should the nonconsolidated affiliates be unable to do so. Refer to Note 7, "Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these entities. 
 
 GTSC - GTSC maintains a warehouse line of credit with a maximum borrowing capacity of 325.0 million, with an option to increase to 375.0 million subject to the lender's consent. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, at GTSC's election, the maximum borrowing capacity on the line of credit was reduced to 275.0 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partner's share, incurred by GTSC was 268.2 million (of which our proportionate share is 107.3 million), and 261.3 million (of which our proportionate share is 104.5 million), respectively. The debt bears interest at a variable rate based on a Commercial Paper or adjusted SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.65 to 2.5 per annum and matures on December 15, 2026. 
 
 Sungenia JV - Sungenia maintains a debt facility agreement with a maximum borrowing capacity of 54.1 million Australian dollars, or 37.5 million converted at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of the debt, including both our and our partners' share, incurred by Sungenia JV was 31.4 million (of which our proportionate share is approximately 15.7 million), and 25.2 million (of which our proportionate share is 12.6 million), respectively. The debt bears interest at a variable rate based on the BBSY rate plus a margin ranging from 0.95 to 1.4 , subject to adjustment for additional future commitments, per annum and matures on June 30, 2027.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. We mitigate this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage, minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the periodic use of derivatives. Our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that interest rate changes could have on our future cash flows. From time to time, we employ derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 
 
 Our variable rate debt totaled 432.4 million and 1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, after adjusting for the impact of hedging in place through the use of interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our variable debt bore interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR, the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, the Australian BBSY rate, the Daily SONIA Rate or the CORRA, and the Eurodollar rate or Prime rate plus a margin. If the above rates increased or decreased by 1.0 , our interest expense would have increased or decreased by 6.7 million and 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on the 898.0 million and 1.4 billion average balance outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities, respectively. Our variable rate debt, interest expense and average balance outstanding under our variable rate debt facility includes the impact of hedge activity. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in currencies against the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our results of operations. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of remeasurement and translation of the assets and liabilities of our properties in the United Kingdom and Canada, and our joint venture in Australia, into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in our results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our shareholder's equity included 888.4 million and 893.9 million from our investments and operations in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia which collectively represented 11.7 and 12.5 of total shareholder's equity, respectively. Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 10.0 strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar would have caused a reduction of 88.8 million and 89.4 million to our total shareholder's equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Capital Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under other financing arrangements. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of capital we raise.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) at September 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. These material weaknesses have not been remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 As described in Part II, Item 9A "Controls and Procedures" of our 2023 Annual Report, as of December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness relating to the design of management's review controls of potential triggering events related to the evaluation for impairment of goodwill relating to our Park Holidays business within the UK reporting segment. 
 
 Subsequent to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, management identified a material weakness relating to the design of management's review controls of the testing for long-lived asset impairments as of March 31, 2024, relating to certain other properties within the UK reporting segment. Management has concluded that this material weakness did not create any material misstatement to previously issued financial statements for any prior periods or the current period. 
 
 Remediation of Material Weaknesses 
 
 The Company and its Board of Directors are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has developed, and is implementing, a comprehensive plan to remediate the material weaknesses. Remediation efforts are focused on more rigorous policies and procedures and sufficiency of reviews for the Company's evaluation of impairment for goodwill and long-lived assets. These efforts include enhanced education and training, including continuing professional education related to the evaluation of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, development of a continuous process for monitoring, assessment and communication, as well as involvement of additional key stakeholders in reviews. 
 
 Management believes the measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses that we have identified. As management continues to evaluate and improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify certain of the remediation measures identified. 
 
 We will not be able to conclude whether these efforts will fully remediate the material weaknesses until the updated controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that such controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we continued to enhance and refine our processes, procedures, and controls in conjunction with the launch and adoption of a new integrated ERP system, which replaced many of our existing core financial systems. The system enhances efficiencies and simplifies our accounting and reporting processes. 
 
 Except as discussed in the preceding paragraph and above under "Remediation of Material Weaknesses," there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
