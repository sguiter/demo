IRIDEX Corporation Notes to Unaudited Condensed Co nsolidated Financial Statements million Note with The Lind Partners, LLC Lind (with an option to have an additional million in a Subsequent Note), management believes it has alleviated substantial doubt about the Company s ability to satisfy its liquidity needs over the next 12 months.

periods that begin subsequent to the expiration of the standard two-year warranty. The customer can opt to purchase the service contract at the time of the system sale or after the initial system sale. 

 The Company recognizes revenue from service contracts ratably over the service period. Revenue recognition for the sale of a service contract is largely dependent on the timing of the sale as follows: a) Service Contract Sale in Conjunction with System Sale: If the customer opts to purchase a service contract at the time of the system sale, the Company allocates the transaction price of the distinct performance obligations in the contract by determining stand-alone selling price using historical pricing net of any variable consideration or discounts to specifically allocate to a particular performance obligation. 

 b) Service Contract Sale Subsequent to System Sale: If the customer opts to purchase a service contract after the initial system sale, the Company determines the amount of time that has elapsed since the initial system sale. If the service contract is purchased within days of the initial sale, the Company considers this sale to be an additional element of the original sale and allocates the transaction price of the distinct performance obligations in the contract by determining stand-alone selling price using historical pricing net of any variable consideration or discounts to specifically allocate to a particular performance obligation. If the service contract is purchased subsequent to 60 days after the initial sale, the sale of the service contract is deemed a separate contract and is deferred at the selling price and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

 3. System Repairs (outside of warranty): Customers will occasionally request repairs from the Company subsequent to the expiration of the standard warranty and outside of a service contract. 

 The Company recognizes revenue from system repairs (outside of warranty) at a point in time. When the customer requests repairs from the Company subsequent to the expiration of the standard warranty and outside of a service contract, these repair contracts are considered separate from the initial sale. As such, revenue is recognized as the repair services are rendered and the performance obligation satisfied. 4. Royalty Revenue: The Company has royalty agreements with customers related to the sale of the Company s intellectual proper ty. Under the terms of these agreements, one customer is to remit a percentage of sales to the Company as the sales occur and one customer is to remit fixed amount royalty payments based on the quantity sold as the sales occur. 

 The arrangements with three customers are for sales-based licenses of intellectual property, for which the guidance in paragraph ASC 606-10-55-65 applies. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time, only as the subsequent sale occurs. However, the Company notes that such sales being reported by the licensee with a quarter in arrears, such revenue is recognized at the time it is reported and paid by the licensee given that any estimated variable consideration would have to be fully constrained due to the unpredictability of such estimate and the unavoidable risk that it may lead to significant revenue reversals. For the arrangement with one customer, the Company had concluded that there is one combined performance obligation to be satisfied. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue related to this arrangement over time. 

11 

million. Of this amount, management has fully-constrained and returned to Topcon the arrangement fee allocated to Belarus (approximately million) because obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and termination of existing distributor relationship was not feasible. For each of the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , million in revenue related to the exclusive distribution rights were recorded. For each of the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , million in revenue related to the exclusive distribution rights were recorded. Costs of Obtaining Revenue Contracts The Company recognized assets from certain costs incurred to obtain revenue contracts. These costs relate to sales commissions arising from the sale of our products. The costs are considered incremental and recoverable of obtaining revenue contracts with customers. These deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit, which typically ranges from to years. As of September 28, 2024, the Company recognized deferred costs incurred to obtain revenue contracts with customers, net of accumulated amortiza tion, of thousand and included these amounts in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other long-term assets in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense was thousand and thousand for both of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. There were impairment expenses for both of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Sales commissions that do not represent incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred. As a practical expedient, the Company will not recognize such sales commission as a contract asset but rather recognize as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Company would have otherwise recognized is one year or less. Contract Fulfillment Costs The Company recognized an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract. These costs relate directly and must be incurred to satisfy performance obligations on certain specific contract with a customer. These costs are expected to be recovered over time and are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the recognition of revenue to which it relates. As of September 28, 2024, the Company recognized deferred costs incurred to fulfill a contract wit h a customer, net of accumulated amortization, of million, and included these amounts in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other long-term assets in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense was thousand and thousand for both of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 . There were impairment expenses for each of three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 .

As warranty reserves do not meet the criteria to have separate captions on the face of the condensed consolidated balance sheet, we removed these captions and included those amounts in other current and long-term liabilities.

The million convertible debt was issued with an original issue discount OID of million. In addition, the Company incurred million debt issuance costs, including million legal expenses, thousand relating to the First Incentive Share Installment and thousand in commitment fees. During both the three and nine month period ended September 28, 2024, thousand of the original issue discount (as an interest expense) and thousand debt issuance costs (as operating expenses) were recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt. The accretion of the OID and amortization of debt issuance costs under that method is deemed materially consistent with the effective interest rate method. As of September 28, 2024, the convertible note payable outstanding totaled million of debt, net of the remaining balances of million of OID and million of debt issuance costs. As of September 28,2024, the short term and long term debt (Notes Payable) were million and million, respectively.

Average volatility 

Option-pricing models require the input of various subjective assumptions, including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility is based on an analysis of the Company s stock price history over a period commensurate with the expected term of the options, trading volume of the Company s stock, look-back volatilities and Company-specific events that affected volatility in a prior period. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by the Company, the contractual term, the vesting period and the expected remaining term of the outstanding options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury interest rates whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. No dividend yield is included as the Company has t issued any dividends and does not anticipate issuing any dividends in the future.

Deferred Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, based on the Company s recent history of losses and its forecasted losses, management believes it is more likely than not that a full valuation allowance is required. Accordingly, the Company continues to provide a full valuation allowance on its federal and states deferred tax assets. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had million of unrecognized tax benefits, o f the unrecognized tax benefits would result in a change in the Company s effective tax rate if recognized in future years. The Company is not aware of any other uncertain tax positions that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material deviation in this estimate during the fiscal year.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management and should be read in conjunction with the section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled Risk Factors. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors. Overview IRIDEX is an ophthalmic medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough products and procedures used to treat sight-threatening eye conditions, including glaucoma and retinal diseases. Our propriety MicroPulse Technology and Endpoint Management Technology are used for the treatment of glaucoma and retina disorders. Both technologies are offered as optional treatment modes in select laser consoles in addition to the standard continuous-wave CW treatment mode. They allow low-energy, subvisible, tissue-sparing laser therapy by different means: MicroPulse technology uses short, microsecond-long laser pulses that allow tissue to cool between pulses giving physicians finer control of thermal elevation to minimize tissue damage. Endpoint Management technology uses a delivery algorithm to titrate the laser energy. CW laser photocoagulation can stabilize vision over the long term but can also result in varying degrees of vision loss. Both MicroPulse and Endpoint Management technologies have demonstrated clinical efficacy with a safer profile compared to standard high-energy CW laser for the treatment of both retinal diseases and glaucoma. Our products consist of laser consoles, delivery devices and consumable probes. Our laser consoles consist of the following product lines: Glaucoma Our primary glaucoma console line is the Cyclo G6 laser system with MicroPulse technology. In addition, our medical retina consoles have features supporting glaucoma laser treatments. 

 Medical Retina Our medical-retina product line includes our portable IQ 532 and IQ 577 laser systems with MicroPulse technology; and the Pattern Scanning Laser PASCAL System, an integrated workstation with Endpoint Management technology and MicroPulse technology. These systems are ideal for multispecialty practices because these lasers also can be used to treat glaucoma, i.e., single-spot laser trabeculoplasty using MicroPulse technology, iridotomy, and iridectomy using the IQ lasers; and pattern scanning laser trabeculoplasty PSLT using the PASCAL laser system. 

 Surgical Retina Our surgical-retina product line includes our OcuLight TX and OcuLight SLx (with MicroPulse technology) laser photocoagulation systems. These systems are often used in vitrectomy procedures, which are used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular holes, retinal tears and detachments. 

 Our business generates recurring revenues through sales of consumable products, predominantly single-use laser probe devices and other instrumentation, as well as repair, service and extended service contracts for our laser systems. Our laser probes consist of the following product lines: Glaucoma Probes used in our glaucoma product line include our patented single-use delivery devices - MicroPulse P3 , G-Probe , and G-Probe Illuminate . 

 Surgical Retina Probes used in our surgical-retina product line include our family of single-use EndoProbe handpieces. 

 Ophthalmologists typically use our laser systems in hospital operating rooms and ambulatory surgical centers, as well as their offices and clinics. In operating rooms and ambulatory surgical centers, ophthalmologists use our laser systems with either an indirect laser ophthalmoscope or a single-use consumable probe, including MicroPulse P3 , G-Probe and G-Probe Illuminate delivery devices, and EndoProbe handpieces. In the offices and clinics, ophthalmologists use our laser systems with either an indirect laser ophthalmoscope or a slit-lamp adapter. Our products are sold in the United States and Germany predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally (aside from Germany) primarily through independent distributors. Sales to international distributors are made on open credit terms or letters of credit and are currently denominated in U.S. dollars and accordingly, are not subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations. However, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region, leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region. Sales to direct end users transacted through our German office are denominated in Euros and are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations. Cost of revenues consists primarily of our direct manufacturing costs which include the cost of components and sub-systems, assembling, packaging, shipping and testing components at our facility, direct labor and associated overhead, warranty, royalty and 

 22 

amortization of intangible assets and depot service costs. For certain of our products, we are responsible for the cost of the fully assembled product that is manufactured by a third-party. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, materials to support new product development and research support provided to clinicians at medical institutions developing new applications, which utilize our products and regulatory expenses. Research and development costs have been expensed as incurred. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel, sales commissions, travel expenses, advertising and promotional expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel, legal, accounting and other public company costs, insurance and other expenses not allocated to other departments. Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions to our Business Current macroeconomic conditions exhibit challenges that can affect capital equipment purchasing demand and timing, including recessionary fears, inflation concerns, changing interest rates, concerns related to the upcoming presidential election in the United States, as well as other geopolitical developments, have impacted and may continue to impact business spending and the economy as a whole. As a result, we have seen customers extend purchase decision cycles. We have also experienced some demand softness due to pricing effects from the strength of the U.S. Dollar that have impacted and may continue to impact our operations. The macroeconomic conditions on our business and operations remain uncertain, and it is not possible for us to predict the duration and extent to which they will affect our business, future results of operations, and financial condition. For more information on risks associated with the current macroeconomic conditions, see the section titled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part II.

While we believe that the market for our products remains strong, the overall capital expenditure landscape within hospitals, surgical centers and physician offices may continue to be negatively impacted by persistent macroeconomic concerns. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit decreased 1.3 million, or 23.1 from 5.6 million to 4.3 million. Gross margin decreased by 6.4 from 43.7 to 37.3 . The decrease in gross margin was driven by lower royalty revenues. Gross margins may fluctuate due to changes in the relative proportion of domestic and international sales, the product mix of sales, introduction of new products, manufacturing variances, total unit volume changes that lead to greater or lesser production efficiencies and other factors. Research and Development Research and development expenses decreased by 0.2 million, or 15.7 from 1.5 million to 1.3 million. Spending on investment in PASCAL product line and on new and expanded product portfolio decreased as we completed these projects. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses decreased 1.2 million, or 30.8 , from 3.8 million to 2.6 million. The decrease was related to lower sales costs associated with lower commissions and reduction on headcount. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 15.6 from 1.9 million to 2.2 million. The increase is a result of higher consulting costs and deal related legal expenses. Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense, net was 46 thousand for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to other expense, net, of 58 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income (expense), net, consisted primarily of interest income or expense and foreign currency transaction gain or loss. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of 17 thousand and 8 thousand for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Our total revenues decreased by 3.4 million, or 8.7 , from 39.4 million to 36.0 million. The decrease was driven by softer demand in our Glaucoma and Retina product lines, and by lower royalties due to the expiration of licensed patents. While we believe that the market for our products remains strong, the overall capital expenditure landscape within hospitals, surgical centers and physician offices may continue to be negatively impacted by persistent macroeconomic concerns discussed above. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit decreased 3.0 million, or 17.8 , from 16.9 million to 13.9 million. Gross margin decreased by 4.2 from 42.9 to 38.7 . The decrease in gross margin was driven by lower revenues and higher manufacturing overhead absorbed by less revenue. Gross margins may fluctuate due to changes in the relative proportion of domestic and international sales, the product mix of sales, introduction of new products, manufacturing variances, total unit volume changes that lead to greater or lesser production efficiencies and other factors. 

 24 

Research and Development Research and development expenses decreased by 0.8 million, or 15.6 , from 5.1 million to 4.3 million. Spending on investment in PASCAL product line and on new and expanded product portfolio decreased as we completed these new projects. We implemented cost savings measures including reductions in workforce that resulted in lower headcount expenses. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 2.5 million, or 20.1 , from 12.4 million to 9.9 million. The decrease was related to the reduction in headcount and lower consulting and travel expenses. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by 1.2 million, or 18.3 , from 6.3 million to 7.5 million. The increase is a result of higher consulting costs and deal related legal expenses. Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense, net increased by 0.5 million from net income of 0.3 million to net other expense, net of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 28 2024. Other income (expense), net, consisted primarily of interest income or expense and foreign currency transaction gain or loss. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of 74 thousand and 30 thousand for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Management Plans Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing or to raise capital. As of September 28, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.9 million and working capital of 8.5 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 7.0 million and working capital of 14.5 million as of December 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities was 6.0 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to net cash used in operating activities of 5.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in operating activities, expressed in direct cash flow terms, was primarily due to cash used in inventory, prepaids, and other current assets and accrued expenses, partially offset by decreases in cash paid to accounts payable and increased cash collections from accounts receivable. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023 net cash used in investing activities was 4 thousand and 141 thousand, respectively, which consisted of capital expenditures. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, net cash 2.8 million was provided by financing activities of issuance of convertible notes, net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 50 thousand. We have historically funded our operations primarily through sales of our products to customers, sales of our common stock and borrowing arrangements. As of September 28, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 3.9 million. We have incurred net losses over the last several years, and as of September 28, 2024, have an accumulated deficit of approximately 89.6 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Management evaluates whether there are relevant conditions and events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we implemented cost savings initiatives to increase operational efficiencies across all departments, which we expect will decrease our operating expenses and increase working capital through January 3, 2026. Based on these cost savings initiatives implemented by us and the closing of the 3.4 million Note with Lind (with an option to have an additional 1.5 million in a Subsequent Note), management believes we have alleviated substantial doubt about our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. On August 7, 2024, we closed a Note with Lind and raised net proceeds of approximately 3.4 million. These funds are sufficient to meet our immediate and near-term capital requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our strategic alternatives, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and our costs to implement new manufacturing technologies. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be 

 25 

able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Additionally, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosure about Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. Based on the foregoing, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, condensed consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Item 1A. Ri sk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Risk Factor Summary Our business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following: General economic factors general macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and changing interest rates, a reduction in business confidence and activity, global pandemics and responsive measures and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts.

 Factors That May Affect Future Results In addition to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, common stock price, financial condition or results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Risks Relating to our Business We may need additional funding and may not be able to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay or reduce our commercialization efforts. We are actively engaged in a review of our near-, medium- and long-term financing needs, which includes seeking to raise additional capital through strategic alternatives, equity offerings and debt financings. Such additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Given the current market price of our common stock, any equity financing would result in 

 28 

significant dilution to our existing stockholders. In addition, any additional equity or debt financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. For example, if we raise funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the terms of debt securities issued, or borrowings, could impose significant restrictions on our operations including restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to pay dividends, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms, such as relinquishment or licensing of certain technologies or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve for future potential arrangements when we might otherwise be able to achieve more favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay sales and marketing efforts or other activities necessary to commercialize our products. If this were to occur, our ability to grow and support our business and to respond to market challenges could be significantly limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The current macroeconomic conditions have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our operations, including our ability to manufacture and supply products and perform research and development activities, and our customers usage of our products, all of which have had and may continue to have a material and adverse effect on our business, future revenues and financial condition. We are unable to predict the extent to which any future global pandemic or other public health emergencies or outbreaks and related macroeconomic impacts may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives . Our business, results of operation and financial performance were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such as travel restrictions in countries and regions in which we have operations or manufacturing partners. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant and unpredictable interruptions in the supply of raw materials, components and sub-assemblies necessary to manufacture and assemble our products and reductions in the demand for our products if healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of COVID-19 or any future outbreak of disease. In addition, our customers may delay, cancel or redirect planned capital expenditures in order to focus resources on any future outbreak of disease, global pandemic or in response to macroeconomic disruption related to any future global pandemic. In the near term, a future outbreak of disease or global pandemic may negatively impact the use of our products and the number of ophthalmic treatments and procedures performed. If the volume of elective procedures declines, our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. The volatile macroeconomic environment has created economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets around the world, resulting in an economic downturn that has affected and may likely continue to affect demand for our products and impact our results of operations. As a result, this may lead to a period of regional, national, and global economic slowdown or regional, national, or global recessions that would curtail or delay spending by hospitals and affect demand for our products as well as increase the risk of customer defaults or delays in payments. Our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase, lease, or service of our products due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures, or other reason. The ultimate impact of the volatile macroeconomic conditions on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the recommendations by medical authorities on whether hospitals should and may perform elective surgical procedures; hospitals abilities and willingness to devote resources to elective surgical procedures; governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and may continue to be taken in response to any future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies or outbreaks (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of other public health emergencies or any future outbreak of disease and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when the current volatile macroeconomic conditions subside. We have experienced and may continue to experience in subsequent periods, disruptions to our business that may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Servicing our existing and future debt, including the Note, may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness. On August 7, 2024, we issued the Note to Lind, which has a principal amount of 4,200,000, and we may, in the future, issue the Subsequent Note to Lind which would have a principal amount of up to 1,800,000. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Lind Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. We may not generate cash flow from 

 29 

operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Note contain, and any of our future debt agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle repayments of the Note in cash, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to make cash payments as required by the Note. Following the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), Lind may require us to prepay, effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control, the Note in an amount equal to 105 of the outstanding principal amount of the Note as of such date. In addition, commencing 120 days from the issuance date of the Note, the Company will be required to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Note in twenty consecutive monthly installments of cash, Repayment Shares, or a combination of cash and Repayment Shares, at the Company s option, provided that no portion of the outstanding principal amount may be paid in Repayment Shares unless such Repayment Shares (A) may be immediately resold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act ), by a person that is not an affiliate of the Company, or (B) are registered for resale under the 1933 Act and a registration statement is in effect and lawfully usable to effect immediate sales of such Repayment Shares. If we do not meet the conditions for repayment in Repayment Shares, we will be required to make such monthly payments in cash. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make such payments on the Note or at its maturity. In addition, any cash payments would reduce the amount of cash available for our operations, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Our ability to make cash payments in connection with the Note may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to make payments as required by the Note would constitute a default under the Note. A default under the Note could also lead to a default under agreements governing any of our existing or future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a Change of Control under the Note could constitute an event of default under other agreements. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness. Any failure by us to repay indebtedness, in each case, when required to do so pursuant to the terms of the Note, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Lind has conversion rights under the Note, the exercise of which could result in the issuance of a substantial amount of our common stock at a significant discount to the trading price of our common stock. The Note is convertible at Lind s option into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 2.44, subject to any adjustments set forth in the Note. However, upon the occurrence of a Delisting Event or an Event of Default (each as defined in the Note), the Notewill become immediately due and payable, and Lind may declare an amount equal to 120 of the then outstanding principal amount of the Note due and payable, in addition to any other remedies under the Transaction Documents. Additionally, the occurrence of a Delisting Event, an Event of Default or an event which with the passage of time may result in an Event of Default, Lind may convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Note at the lower of (i) the then-current conversion price and (ii) the greater of (a) eighty-percent (80 of the average of the three (3) lowest daily VWAPs during the twenty (20) trading days prior to the delivery of the notice of conversion and (b) a floor price of 0.39, which would significantly dilute our stockholders. If we experience a Delisting Event or an Event of Default under the Note, we may experience a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Divestitures of our businesses or product lines may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and require us to raise additional capital to replace revenue from those business units or product lines. We have two main businesses: glaucoma and retina, domestic and international operations within each and many product lines within the two businesses. We periodically evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, and the loss of revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize the expected value from the divestiture of a business or product lines and may need to raise additional capital to replace the revenue generated from the business or product line that is divested. We can provide no assurance that such capital will be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture we undertake could materially and 

 30 

adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may also result in a diversion of management attention, operational difficulties and losses. We may not be successful in our strategic partnership with Topcon and the relationship may divert resources away from existing operations or expose us to liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. On March 2, 2021, we entered into a series of strategic transactions with Topcon, Topcon America Corporation (the Investor and Topcon Medical Laser Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of Topcon TMLS ), which included (i) an asset purchase agreement with TMLS, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all the assets (except for cash and cash equivalents) of TMLS, including rights to the PASCAL product (the Asset Purchase Agreement ), (ii) a distribution agreement dated March 2, 2021, pursuant to which we granted Topcon the exclusive right to distribute our retina and glaucoma products in certain geographies outside the United States (the Distribution Agreement ), and (iii) an investment agreement dated March 2, 2021 (the Investment Agreement ), pursuant to which we sold the Investor 1,618,122 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 10 million. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the transferred assets include substantially all of TMLS assets including the rights to the PASCAL product (the Transferred Assets ). We assumed only those liabilities arising after the closing in connection with the Transferred Assets. In the Asset Purchase Agreement, our company and TMLS made certain customary representations and warranties and agreed to certain customary covenants. The Agreement provides that our company and TMLS will each indemnify the other for losses arising from certain breaches of the Agreement and for certain other liabilities subject to customary caps and deductibles. If there are claims under the indemnification provisions for which we are liable we will need to use some or all our cash to settle those claims. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we appointed Topcon as the exclusive distributor of our glaucoma and retina products, including PASCAL product, in certain countries outside of the United States. Topcon agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize our products in each region throughout the territory, including achieving certain sales baselines by product category and region. If Topcon fails to achieve the baselines in a region, we will have the right to, subject to payment of a fee, terminate Topcon s appointment in such region. The Distribution Agreement and Topcon s appointment will, unless terminated earlier, continue on a country-by-country basis for a period of 10 years from the date exclusivity is granted. The Distribution Agreement includes customary termination rights and effects of termination, including a termination for convenience right in favor of Topcon and, subject to payment of a fee, a termination right in our favor upon a change of control of our company, as well as customary indemnification provisions. As a result of the Distribution Agreement, we terminated our relationships with our prior distributors in certain geographies and we are using Topcon as our exclusive distributor. If Topcon is unable to generate as much revenue under the Distribution Agreement as we received from our prior distributors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. If there are claims under the indemnification provisions of the Distribution Agreement for which we are liable, we will need to use some or all our cash to settle those claims or make payments to Topcon pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement. We are investing a substantial amount of time, resources and efforts in connection with our relationship with Topcon, including commercializing our products in certain geographies and working to achieve certain sales baselines by product category and region. All of these actions divert resources away from our other initiatives and operations, particularly with respect to product sales in the United States. These efforts may not result in the anticipated additional products, efficiencies or revenues for our company, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition as a result. We may face quality control and other production issues that could materially and adversely impact our sales and financial results and the acceptance of our products. The manufacture of our infrared and visible laser consoles and related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process. We may experience manufacturing difficulties, quality control issues or assembly constraints. If our sales increase substantially, we may need to increase our production capacity and may not be able to do so in a timely, effective or cost-efficient manner. We may not be able (ourselves or through third parties) to manufacture or supply sufficient quantities of our products, which may require that we qualify other manufacturers for our products. Furthermore, we may experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations. In the past several years, we have experienced supply chain, production and training issues as we have expanded our product lines and sales volumes, and may experience similar issues in the future as we continue to grow our business. These issues have caused, and may in the future cause, us to reduce or delay the shipment of our products and incur costs to service or replace products already shipped to customers. We have also incurred, and may in the future incur, additional costs to rectify or prevent similar issues in the future. Our efforts to address these supply chain, production and training issues may not be successful, and if we are unable to address these issues in a timely and cost-effective manner, product shipments to our customers could be delayed, our sales levels may suffer and manufacturing and operational costs may increase, any of which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

 31 

Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Laser systems are inherently complex in design and require regular maintenance. The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process. As a result of the technical complexity of our products, changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. To the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected. We provide warranties on certain of our product sales, and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale. The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty. We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs. If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to recognize additional cost of revenues may be required in future periods. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects. As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: loss of customers; 

 increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses; 

 damage to our brand reputation; 

 failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance; 

 diversion of development and engineering resources; and 

 legal actions by our customers. 

 The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on our direct and independent sales forces and international distributors to sell our products and if we lose our sales force or distributor relationships, it could harm our business. Our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct and independent sales forces within the United States, direct sales force in Germany and relationships with independent international distributors. Currently our direct and independent sales forces within the United States consist of approximately 30 employees and one independent representatives, respectively, and our direct sales force in Germany consists of one employee. Our international independent distributors are managed by a team of seven people. We generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our products in specified countries and regions. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control. Our international sales are largely dependent on the efforts of these third parties. If any distributor breaches the terms of its distribution agreement with us or fails to generate sales of our products, we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products into that exclusive sales territory could be adversely affected. We do not have any long-term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force. We may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, which may harm our revenues and our ability to maintain market share. Similarly, our independent contractor and distributor agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and independent contractors and distributors may terminate their relationships with us, which would affect our sales and results of operations. Any loss of the members of our existing direct or indirect sales organizations, or any failure to execute on our plans to further develop our sales function, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results. We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a large portion of our revenues from international sales. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, our international sales were 6.1 million, or 52.8 of total revenues. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. All of our international revenues and costs for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 have been denominated in U.S. dollars except for sales transacted through our German subsidiary. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our U.S. dollar-denominated products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets and may negatively affect our reported revenue in any particular reporting period. Our international operations and sales are subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 

 product and production issues; 

32 

performance of our international channel of distributors; 

 longer accounts receivable collection periods; 

 impact of recessions in global economies and availability of credit; 

 political and economic instability; 

 change in international regulatory agreements and requirements; 

 trade sanctions and embargoes; 

 impact of international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest; 

 foreign certification requirements, including continued ability to use the CE mark in Europe, and other local regulatory requirements, pending MDR approvals; 

 differing local product preferences and product requirements; 

 cultural differences; 

 changes in foreign medical reimbursement and coverage policies and programs; 

 reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States; 

 potentially adverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations; 

 protectionist, adverse and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations; 

 greater risk of our employees failing to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including anti-trust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and any trade regulations designed to ensure fair trade practices; and 

 compliance costs and risks of non-compliance with multiple regulatory regimes governing the production, marketing, sale and use of our products. 

 Any one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operating results may be adversely affected by uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures and changes in third-party coverage and reimbursement policies. Our products are typically purchased by doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users, which bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs and private insurance plans, for the health-care services provided to their patients. Changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third-party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely. Among other things, Congress has in the past proposed changes to and the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act , and the current U.S. presidential administration has announced certain policy changes that could impact the availability of benefits under the Affordable Care Act. For example, tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who did not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the individual mandate ). We anticipate continued Congressional interest in modifying provisions of the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to or any repeal of the Affordable Care Act, with respect to certain of its provisions or in its entirety or related administrative policies. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We are unable to predict what legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health-care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future at the state or federal level, or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us. Furthermore, existing legislation and regulation related to the health-care industry and third-party coverage reimbursement, including the Affordable Care Act, has been subject to judicial challenge, and may be subject to similar challenges from time to time in the future (such as the California v. Texas case). In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the Affordable Care Act, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products, or the revocation or changes to coverage and reimbursement policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

 33 

Third-party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and continue to challenge the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third-party payers. While we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed, payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used, was investigational or was not cost-effective. If we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and applications or fail to improve our existing products, our business prospects and operating results may suffer. Our ability to generate incremental revenue growth will depend, in part, on the successful outcome of research and development activities, which may include clinical trials that lead to the development of new products and new applications using our products. Our research and development process is expensive, prolonged, and entails considerable uncertainty. Due to the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully. Should the current macroeconomic conditions worsen, it could delay and disrupt our research and development processes even further. Successful commercialization of new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers. In addition, we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products. The extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables, which include, among other things, price, safety, efficacy, reliability, marketing and sales efforts, the development of new applications for these products, the availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our new products, the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns. Our ability to market and sell new products is subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the FDA and foreign government agencies. Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline. We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic slowdowns and related uncertainties. We are subject to macroeconomic fluctuations in the U.S. and worldwide economy including inflationary pressures that may cause the cost of manufacturing our products or servicing our products to increase. Concerns about consumer and investor confidence, the upcoming presidential election in the United States, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending, international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic-related illness could reduce customer orders or cause customer order cancellations. For example, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, such as that occurring in Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas, and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad. Weak economic conditions and declines in consumer spending and consumption may harm our operating results. Purchases of our products are often discretionary. During uncertain economic times, customers or potential customers may delay, reduce or forgo their purchases of our products and services, which may impact our business in a number of ways, including lower prices for our products and services and reducing or delaying sales. There could be a number of follow-on effects from economic uncertainty on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, delays in customer payments of outstanding accounts receivable and/or customer insolvencies, counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations, and increasing expense or inability to obtain future financing. In addition, negative macroeconomic conditions in the United States (including elevated interest rates) have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on capital market conditions, which could limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms or at all. If economic uncertainty persisted, or if the economy entered a prolonged period of decelerating growth, our results of operations may be harmed. We maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance. We maintain cash deposits in financial institutions that may be higher than the 250,000 limit insured by the FDIC or similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns or rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. For example, on March 10, 2023, SVB failed and was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions, or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. 

 34 

Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future. Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following: general macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and changing interest rates, upcoming presidential election in the United States, global pandemics and responsive measures and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts; 

 changes in the prices at which we can sell our products, including the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 

 introduction of new products, product enhancements and new applications by our competitors, including new drugs, entry of new competitors into our markets, pricing pressures and other competitive factors; 

 any delays or reductions in product shipments, or product recalls, resulting from manufacturing, distribution or other operational issues; 

 the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products, product enhancements and new applications; 

 changes in demand for our existing line of ophthalmology products; 

 the cost and availability of components and subassemblies, including the willingness and ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to timely deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned; 

 our ability to maintain sales volumes at a level sufficient to cover fixed manufacturing and operating costs; 

 fluctuations in our product mix within ophthalmology products and foreign and domestic sales; 

 the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements; 

 our long and highly variable sales cycle; 

 changes in customers or potential customers budgets as a result of, among other things, reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products; 

 variances in shipment volumes as a result of product, supply chain due to global constraints or other factors and training issues; and 

 increased product innovation costs. 

 In addition to these factors, our quarterly results have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by seasonal factors. Our expense levels are based, in part, on expected future sales. If sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter s product shipments near the end of the quarter. If that pattern continues, any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarters. Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall. We rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations. We currently market visible and infrared medical laser systems and delivery devices to the ophthalmology market. We believe that continued and increased sales, if any, of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following: the impact of any future resurgence of any future global pandemic or other public health emergencies on timing of ophthalmic treatment procedures; 

 acceptance of product performance, features, ease of use, scalability and durability, including with respect to our MicroPulse laser photocoagulation systems, and our PASCAL product; 

 recommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists, other clinicians, and their associated opinion leaders; 

 marketing and clinical study outcomes; 

 price of our products and prices of competing products and technologies, particularly in light of the current macro-economic environment where healthcare systems and healthcare operators are becoming increasingly price sensitive; 

35 

availability of competing products, technologies and alternative treatments; and 

 level of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products. 

 In addition, we derive a meaningful portion of our sales in the form of recurring revenues from selling consumable instrumentation, including our probe for the Cyclo G6 Laser and EndoProbe devices. Our ability to increase recurring revenues from the sale of consumable products will depend primarily upon the features of our current products and product innovation, the quality of, ease of use and prices of our products, including the relationship to prices of competing products. The level of our service revenues will depend on the quality of service we provide and the responsiveness and the willingness of our customers to use our products and services rather than purchase competing products or services. Any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or our revenues associated therewith may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future. Competition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic treatment procedures is expected to increase. This market is also characterized by technological innovation and change. We compete by providing features and services that are valued by our customers such as: enhanced product performance and clinical outcomes, ease of use, durability, versatility, customer training services and rapid repair of equipment. Our principal ophthalmic laser competitors are Alcon Inc., Bausch Health Companies Inc., Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Lumenis Ltd., Nidek Co. Ltd., Lumibird, ARC Gmbh, Meridian, OD-OS GmBh and Norlase. We also compete with alternative glaucoma surgical device companies such as Alcon, Inc., Novartis AG, Allergan, Inc., Glaukos Corporation and New World Medical, Inc. Pharmaceuticals represent alternative treatments to our laser procedures. Some of our principal pharmaceutical competitors are Alcon, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd. (Genentech). Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, other medical device companies, academic and research institutions, or others, may develop new technologies or therapies, including medical devices, surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us, or are less expensive than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, our ability to manage our business could be impaired. Our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management, technical, sales, and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key personnel are employees-at-will, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain them. Key personnel have left our company in the past, and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future. Additionally, our common stock is currently trading at a price below the exercise price of many of our outstanding options. As a result, these underwater options are less useful as a motivation and retention tool for our existing employees. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, and the results of our operations. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry and the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as other geographic markets in which we recruit, is highly competitive and characterized by increasing salaries, which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates. In addition, the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful.

If we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. While we do not bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, because payment is in many cases available for our products from such payors, many healthcare laws place limitations and requirements on the manner in which we conduct our business (including our sales and promotional activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities) and could result in liability and exposure for us. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include (i) the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us if we provide coding and billing advice to customers, or under theories of implied certification where the government and qui tam relators may allege that device companies are liable where a product that was paid for by the government in whole or in part was promoted off-label, lacked necessary clearance or approval, or failed to comply with good manufacturing practices or other laws; (iii) transparency laws and related reporting and disclosures requirements such as the federal Sunshine Act, now known as Open Payments; and/or (iv) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, including, without limitation anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our operations being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that the government s provisions are open to a variety of evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Compliance with Open Payments, commonly known as the Sunshine Act, has presented a number of challenges to companies such as ours, in terms of interpretation of the law and its implementation. Under the Sunshine Act, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS has the potential to impose penalties of up to 1.26 million per year for violations, depending on the circumstances and adjusted annually for inflation, although enforcement has been negligible to date. Payments reported under the Sunshine Act also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws. The risk that we may be found in violation of these laws may be increased by the fact that we do not have a formal healthcare compliance program in place. Further, while safe harbors may in some instances be available and utilized by companies to reduce risks associated with the Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other healthcare laws, we have not necessarily utilized such safe harbors nor fully followed all elements required to claim the benefit of such safe harbors in all possible instances. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. We depend on collaborative relationships to develop, introduce and market new products, product enhancements and applications. We depend on both clinical and commercial collaborative relationships. We have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and innovation and clinical testing of our products. Commercially, we have licensing agreements with strategic partners. The failure to obtain any additional future clinical or commercial collaborations and the resulting failure or success of such collaboration relationships could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot increase our sales volumes, reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset potential reductions in the average unit price of our products, our operating results may suffer. The average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix, competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by our competitors or other factors. If we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or through new product introductions, our net revenues will decline. In addition, to maintain our gross margins we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products. If we cannot maintain our gross margins our business could be seriously harmed, particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales. 

 37 

Our promotional practices are subject to extensive government scrutiny. We may be subject to governmental, regulatory and other legal proceedings relative to advertising, promotion and marketing that could have a significant negative effect on our business. We are subject to governmental oversight and associated civil and criminal enforcement relating to drug and medical device advertising, promotion, and marketing, and such enforcement is evolving and intensifying. In the United States, we are subject to potential enforcement from the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Other parties, including private plaintiffs, also are commonly initiating lawsuits against pharmaceutical and medical device companies, alleging off-label marketing and other violations. We may be subject to liability based on the actions of individual employees and contractors carrying out activities on our behalf, including sales representatives who may interact with healthcare professionals. We rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business. Our success and ability to compete is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary information. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business. As of September 28, 2024, our patent portfolio includes 67 active United States patents and 94 active international patents on the technologies related to our products and processes. In addition, as of September 28, 2024, we have 12 patent applications pending in the United States and 19 international patent applications pending. Our patent applications may not be approved. Any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products. Moreover, our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. Patents have a limited lifetime and once a patent expires competition may increase. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us, without additional consideration, any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us, subject to customary exceptions. Proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and others may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Also, our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors. The laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Numerous patents are held by others, including academic institutions and our competitors. Patent applications filed in the United States generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date. However, since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time, both within the United States and internationally, we cannot provide assurance that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties. We have, from time to time, been notified of, or have otherwise been made aware of, claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property. Although patent holders commonly offer such licenses, licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable. Any claims, with or without merit, and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits, would be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause shipment delays or require us to develop non-infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs. We use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain or manufacture the necessary components, materials, and fully assembled products. Lead times for components and fully assembled products vary significantly and depend on numerous factors, including the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for such products. If we overestimate the demand for our product, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate demand for our product and consequently, our components, materials and fully assembled product requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt our 

 38 

manufacturing, delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales. Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results. We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers. We rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products, including optics, laser diodes and crystals. We have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components and fully-assembled products on a purchase order basis. Some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited source suppliers. In addition, some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies whose operations may be disrupted or discontinued at any time. There are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers, including the following: the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including any future global pandemic and inflationary pressures on global supply chains and market stability; 

 unavailability of shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components and products in the quantities that we require, or that satisfy the environmental requirements to which we are subject; 

 delays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components and products on the dates we require; 

 failure of suppliers to manufacture and assemble components and products to our specifications, and potentially reduced quality; and 

 inability to obtain components and products in a timely manner or at acceptable prices due to global supply chain constraints or other factors. 

 Our business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components and fully-assembled products. The process of qualifying suppliers is complex, requires extensive testing with our products, and may be lengthy, particularly as new products are introduced. New suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes. In addition, the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under FDA and relevant foreign regulatory agency guidelines, which may delay sales and increase product costs. Any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and sole source components or products may impair our ability to offer our existing products, delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction, materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline. Establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components or products would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins. Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components or fully-assembled products in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted. If our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed. Our facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire, flood, unpredictable power outages, or earthquake. All of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Mountain View, California. California can experience earthquakes, catastrophic wildfires, and intermittent power outages. Any such loss at any of our facilities caused by fires, flooding, power outages, or earthquakes could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair and replace our facilities. If we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or breaches of data security, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems to keep financial records and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions, including sales and manufacturing processes. Our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers are potentially vulnerable to disruption, breakdown, damage, service interruption, system malfunction, power outage, natural disaster, malicious intrusion, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer viruses, security breaches and other cyber-attacks. For example, companies have experienced an increase in phishing and spoofing attacks from third parties in connection with working remotely, either permanently or temporarily. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in our information technology systems, it could negatively impact the coordination of our sales, planning and manufacturing activities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, to maximize our information technology efficiency, we have physically consolidated our primary corporate data and computer operations. This concentration, however, exposes us to a greater risk of disruption to our internal information technology systems. Although we maintain offsite back-ups of our data, if operations at our facilities were disrupted, it may cause a material disruption in our business if we are not capable of restoring function on an acceptable time frame. In addition, our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other data security breaches-whether by employees or others-which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of sensitive and confidential information of our employees, customers, suppliers and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 39 

While we have implemented a number of protective measures, including firewalls, antivirus and malware detection tools, patches, log monitors, routine back-ups, system audits, routine password modifications and disaster recovery procedures, we have experienced and may in the future experience spoofing attacks. In addition, our measures to secure our information technology systems may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events, and in some cases we may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. If we are unable to, or perceived or reported to have been or be unable to, prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may be exposed to claims, demands, and litigation or governmental investigations and other proceedings and suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Furthermore, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to protect us from, or adequately mitigate, liabilities or damages resulting from cyber-attacks or security breaches. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. If we fail to maintain our relationships with health-care providers, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline. At the same time, relationships with these individuals and entities are the subject of heightened scrutiny and may present the potential for healthcare compliance risks. We market our products to numerous health-care providers, including physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, government affiliated groups and group purchasing organizations. We have developed and strive to maintain close relationships with members of each of these groups who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs. We rely on these groups to recommend our products to their patients and to other members of their organizations. The failure of our existing products and any new products we may introduce to retain the support of these various groups could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our interactions, communications, and financial relationships with these individuals and entities present potential healthcare compliance risks. We are subject to government regulations which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products. The medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by foreign and state governments. Under the FD C Act and the related regulations, the FDA regulates the design, development, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Before a new device can be introduced into the market, the product must be shown to meet regulatory requirements established by the FD C Act and implemented by the FDA. Unless otherwise exempt, a device manufacturer must obtain marketing clearance through the 510(k) premarket notification process, or approval through the lengthier pre-market approval application PMA process or other processes such as the de novo process. Not all devices are eligible for the 510(k) clearance process. Depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated, the PMA process can take several years, require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures. Even if regulatory clearance or approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions. Our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The FDA imposes a broad range of additional requirements on medical device companies. Our products must be produced in compliance with the Quality System Regulation QSR and our manufacturing facilities are subject to establishment registration and device listing requirements from the FDA, and similar requirements from certain state authorities, and ongoing periodic inspections by the FDA, including unannounced inspections for compliance with applicable requirements. We are subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting obligations for medical device adverse events and malfunctions; notification of our products defects or failure to comply with the FDA s laser regulations; and reporting of recalls, corrections, or removals of our products. The FDA also imposes requirements for the labeling of our products, and places limitations on claims we are permitted to make about our products in promotional labeling. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products, which are non-restricted devices, and exercises oversight in coordination with the FDA. Noncompliance with the applicable requirements can result in, among other things, regulatory citations (including 483 Observations and warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute. Any of these actions by the FDA would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations. Such enforcement action can also result in negative publicity. 

 40 

In addition, we are also subject to varying product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. As a result of our sales in Europe, we are required to have all medical device products CE marked, an international symbol, affixed to all our medical device products demonstrating compliance with the European Medical Device Directives and/or Medical Device Regulations MDR and all applicable standards. While currently all our released medical device products are CE marked, continued certification is based on the successful review of our quality system by our European Registrar during their periodic audits. Any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There are several major regulatory changes occurring in the regulation of medical devices in the European Union (the EU ). The revision of the quality system regulation (ISO 13485:2016) has been released that substantially increased the requirements for a medical device quality system. The MDR has replaced the medical device directives (93/42/EEC), and it substantially changes the way that medical devices are brought to market in the EU and how they maintain compliance throughout the product s life cycle. Due to the UK s exit from EU Brexit ), different rules will apply in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), Northern Ireland and the EU after the Brexit transition period, which began January 1, 2021. Similarly, Switzerland has changed its relationship with the EU and in May 2022, will require medical device manufacturers, including us, to contract with a Swiss authorized representative. Additionally, the new revision 4 of the clinical evaluation report guidance document (MEDDEV 2.7.1) and the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) guidance regarding clinical evidence (MDCG 2020-6) severely restricts the use of substantial equivalence for new products, resulting in the need for formal clinical trial data for many products. These and future changes will increase the cost for compliance and for product development, and they lengthen product introduction cycles. Failure to comply with these changes and any future changes can have an adverse effect on our ability to release new products in a timely manner. Any clinical trials necessary that we may undertake for regulatory approval or marketing reasons will be an expensive, lengthy, costly, and uncertain process, and could result in delays in new product introductions or even an inability to release a product. We may be required to undertake clinical trials often required to obtain regulatory approvals or may choose to undertake such trials for marketing or other reasons. Clinical trials for products such as ours are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain. Any clinical trials that we may undertake would require the investment of significant financial and administrative resources. Moreover, the results of clinical trials are uncertain, and inconclusive or negative results may not support, or may impair, the sale and adoption of our products. We may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results. Any of our products could produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate. We, the FDA, or another regulatory authority could suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believed the trial participants faced unacceptable health risks. If we fail to comply with the FDA s quality system regulation and laser performance standards, our manufacturing operations could be halted, and our business would suffer. We are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Because our products involve the use of lasers, our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific recordkeeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products, as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products. The FDA enforces the QSR and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections. Our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection or our failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our products, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, which would cause our sales and business to suffer. If we modify one of our FDA cleared devices, we may need to submit a new 510(k), or potentially a PMA, and if clearance or approval is not obtained, it would prevent us from selling our modified products or cause us to redesign our products. Any modifications to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenues and future profitability. We have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our products. 

 41 

Efforts to acquire additional companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations, and if we complete additional acquisitions, we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems. As part of our growth strategy, we seek to acquire businesses or product lines for various reasons, including adding new products, adding new customers, increasing penetration with existing customers, adding new manufacturing capabilities or expanding into new geographic markets. Our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financings. These efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. If we complete future acquisitions, we may also experience: difficulties integrating any acquired products into our existing business; 

 difficulties in integrating an acquired company s technologies, services, employees and other service providers, customers, partners, business operations and administrative and software management systems with ours; 

 delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired products; 

 diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns; 

 adverse customer reaction to the product acquisition; and 

 increases in expenses. 

 Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with these types of transactions, we may issue additional equity securities that would dilute the ownership interest of existing investors or earnings per share, use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. These challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our products may be misused, which could harm our reputation and our business. We market and sell our products for use by highly skilled physicians with specialized training and experience in the treatment of eye-related disorders. We, and our distributors, generally offer but do not require purchasers or operators of our products to attend training sessions, nor do we supervise the procedures performed with our products. The physicians who operate our products are responsible for their use and the treatment regime for each individual patient. In addition, non-physicians, particularly in countries outside of the United States, or poorly trained or inexperienced physicians, may make use of our products. Our efforts to market our MicroPulse systems as a fovea-friendly alternative to traditional continuous wavelength systems or alternative treatment methods may result in users failing to implement adequate safety precautions and thereby increase the risks associated with the misuse of our products. The lack of training and the purchase and use of our products by non-physicians or poorly trained or inexperienced physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation, or otherwise cause our business to suffer. Inability of customers to obtain credit or material increases in interest rates may harm our sales. Some of our products are sold to health-care providers in general practice. Many of these health care providers purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third-party financial institutions, including credit facilities and short-term loans. If availability of credit becomes more limited, or interest rates increase, these financing arrangements may be harder to obtain or become more expensive for our customers, which may decrease demand for our products. Any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer. Our products could be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA approval or clearance. A recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or in other cases we may determine that we will recall a product because we have determined that the product is violative, in order to avoid further enforcement action and protect the public health. 

 42 

A government mandated recall, or a voluntary recall by us, could occur as a result of actual or potential component failures, adverse event reports, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Furthermore, we may from time to time initiate a recall of a component or set of components comprising a portion of our laser systems, which could increase customer returns, warranty claims and associated reserve levels. A recall could divert management s attention, cause us to incur significant expenses, harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales and financial results. If product liability claims are successfully asserted against us, we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations. We may be subject to product liability claims from time to time. Our products are highly complex and the risk of significant patient injury is more likely with products and procedures involving the eye. Use of our products incorrectly can result in temporary or permanent loss in vision, burns, scarring, blind spots or other injuries of the eye and we may periodically become subject to product liability lawsuits as a result. We believe we maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance to cover such claims subject to certain deductibles. However, product liability insurance is expensive and we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us, if at all. A successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to manage growth effectively, our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results. We have experienced and may in the future experience growth in our business, both organically and through the acquisition of businesses and products. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through, among other things, new product innovation and clinical trials for new applications and products. We must also be prepared to expand our work force and to train, motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises. Our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. Any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant developments resulting from recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us. Certain of our materials may be subject to the effects of various trade agreements, treaties and tariffs. The prior U.S. presidential administration has imposed tariffs on various goods from various countries, including China, Canada and the EU. As a result, Canada, the EU, China and other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain United States exports. We cannot predict the effect these and potential additional tariffs will have on our business, including in the context of escalating trade tensions. Further tariffs, additional taxes, or trade barriers, both domestically and internationally, may affect our selling and/or manufacturing costs and margins, the competitiveness of our products, or our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, and consequently affect our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of, raw materials and finished goods imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, these potential developments and any market perceptions concerning these and related issues and the attendant regulatory uncertainty regarding, for example, the posture of governments with respect to international trade, could have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic growth which, in turn can adversely affect our business. Furthermore, changes in United States trade policy have resulted and could result in additional reactions from United States trading partners and other countries, including adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. We sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside the United States and we purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the United States. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the United States or may cause us to adjust our worldwide supply chain. Any of these effects could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, may result in lowering our margin on products sold. We cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions. The comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017 and includes, among other items, a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 , certain interest expense deduction limitations and changes in the timing of certain taxable income. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

 43 

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 SAB 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. We have completed our analysis and accounting with respect the Tax Act, and identified no additional changes from amounts previously recorded. However, changes in law, interpretations, and facts may result in adjustments to these amounts. Based on our net operating loss carryovers and valuation allowance, there is no impact to its consolidated financial statements as a result of the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Subsequent legislation, guidance, regulations or audits that differ from our prior assumptions and interpretations, or other factors which were not anticipated at the time we estimated our tax provision could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition. We are subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties. Additionally, challenges to or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and thus could harm our business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of certain metals used in manufacturing which may stem from minerals (so-called conflict minerals which originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions. These metals include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. These metals are central to the technology industry and are present in some of our products as component parts. In most cases no acceptable alternative material exists which has the necessary properties. It is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis but instead a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials must be obtained. The components which incorporate those metals may originate from many sources and we purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used, and components and assemblies which we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We are required to carry out a diligent effort to determine and disclose the source of these materials. There can be no assurance we can obtain this information from intermediate producers not willing or not able to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or to notify us if these sources change. These metals are subject to price fluctuations and shortages which can affect our ability to obtain the manufactured materials we rely on at favorable terms or from consistent sources. These changes could have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and market our devices and products. If we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected. Our products and operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, handling, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous materials and a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate compliance to these with the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit the ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance with such standards or subject us to fines and penalties. Examples of such standards include laws governing the hazardous material content of our devices and products, such as the EU Directive 2015/863 which is known as RoHS 3 and that relates to Restrictions on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances and the EU Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in several other jurisdictions and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our devices and products, inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our devices and products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. New environmental laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our devices and products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements, changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions, including deteriorating market conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a low of 1.97 per share to a high of 3.53 per share. There can be no assurance that our common stock trading price will not suffer declines. Our common stock may experience an imbalance between supply and demand resulting from low trading volumes and therefore broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance. 

 44 

Because we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value. We expect to retain any earnings for use to further develop our business, and do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any such dividends in the future depends upon our earnings, financial condition, capital needs and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors, and may be restricted by future agreements with lenders. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares. If securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our market and our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Ownership of our common stock is concentrated among a few investors, which may affect the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. Substantial sales by such investors could cause our stock price to decline. Our directors, executive officers, current five percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock outstanding. Having such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding common stock or control of our board of directors through a proxy solicitation. As a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner, particularly if material weaknesses or significant deficiencies were to persist. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 while we are a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which could likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our company and our stock price could decline. Our charter documents, anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, and contractual provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of our company. Our certificate of incorporation empowers the board of directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of the preferred stock. These provisions give the board of directors the ability to deter, discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company, even if such a change in control could be deemed in the interest of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares 

 45 

over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including the following: the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our board of directors; 

 only our board of directors is authorized to fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats; 

 special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of the board, chief executive officer or president, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting; 

 stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose other business; and 

 stockholders are not permitted to cumulate votes in the election of directors. 

 In addition, we are generally subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock or prevent changes in our management. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Item 3. Defaults Upo n Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, the Company did not or , and no directors or officers, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f), adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, each as defined in Regulation S-K Item 408.

 1.2 Interest . Other than as set forth in Section 2.2 herein, this Note shall not bear interest. 

 1.3 Principal Installment Payments . Commencing on the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days from the Issuance Date, the Maker shall repay to the Holder the Outstanding Principal Amount hereunder in twenty (20) consecutive monthly installments (each, a Monthly Payment ), on such date and each one (1) month anniversary thereof (each, a Payment Date ), an amount equal to Two Hundred Ten Thousand and Zero/100 Dollars 210,000.00), until the Outstanding Principal Amount has been paid in full prior to or on the Maturity Date or, if earlier, upon acceleration, repayment, conversion or redemption of this Note in accordance with the terms herein.

Following any such increased Monthly Payment, the amount of such increase shall be deducted from the amount of the last Monthly Payment owing hereunder until such Monthly Payment is reduced to zero and each Monthly Payment immediately preceding such Monthly Payment in reverse chronological order until such preceding Monthly Payment is also reduced to zero. Any Repayment Shares required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 1.3 as a result of notice given by the Holder to increase the Monthly Payment following the applicable Payment Date, will be required to delivered from such notice date in accordance with the time frames set forth in Section 3.2. 

 1.4 Prepayment. 	The Maker may repay all, but not less than all, of the then Outstanding Principal Amount at a repayment price equal to the Prepayment Amount on any date following the Prepayment Right Date; provided that the Maker shall have given no less than ten (10) day s written notice to the Holder of such intended prepayment (the Prepayment Notice ). If the Maker elects to prepay this Note pursuant to this Section 1.4 , the Holder shall have the right to deliver a written notice to the Company (a Prepayment Conversion Notice within five (5) Business Days of the Holder s receipt of a Prepayment Notice, of the Holder s election to convert up to one third (1/3) of the Outstanding Principal Amount (the Maximum Amount in accordance with the provisions of Article 3.

 3.1 Conversion . 

 (a) Conversion . At any time following the Issuance Date, this Note shall be convertible (in whole or in part), at the option of the Holder, into such number of fully paid and 

7 

non-assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (x) that portion of the Outstanding Principal Amount that the Holder elects to convert (the Conversion Amount by (y) the Conversion Price then in effect on the date on which the Holder delivers a notice of conversion, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Conversion Notice ), in accordance with the instructions set forth in Section 5.1 to the Maker. The Holder shall deliver this Note to the Maker at the address designated in the Purchase Agreement at such time that this Note is fully converted. With respect to partial conversions of this Note, the Maker shall keep written records of the amount of this Note converted as of the date of such conversion (each, a Conversion Date ). Any amounts of the Outstanding Principal Amount converted pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) shall be credited to the next scheduled Monthly Payment, or if any amount of the Outstanding Principal Amount converted hereunder exceeds the next scheduled Monthly Payment, the next succeeding scheduled Monthly Payment(s) shall be credited, as applicable. 

 (b) Conversion Price . The Conversion Price means, 2.44, and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein, subject to the Floor Price. 

 3.2 Delivery of Conversion Shares . As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any event requiring the issuance of Conversion Shares, and in any event within four (4) Trading Days for the first conversion hereunder and within two (2) Trading Days for any conversion thereafter (such date, the Share Delivery Date ), the Maker shall, at its expense, cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder, or as the Holder may direct, a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of fully paid and nonassessable Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled, in such denominations as may be requested by the Holder, which certificate or certificates shall be free of restrictive and trading legends, except for any such legends as may be required under the Securities Act. In lieu of delivering physical certificates for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the occurrence of any event requiring the issuance of Conversion Shares in accordance with this Note, provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer program or a similar program, upon request of the Holder, the Company shall cause the Transfer Agent to electronically transmit such Conversion Shares so issuable to the Holder (or its designee), by crediting the account of the Holder s (or such designee s) broker with DTC through its Deposit and Withdrawal At Custodian DWAC system (provided that the same time periods herein as for stock certificates shall apply) as instructed by the Holder (or its designee); provided, that such issuance shall only be made through DTC s DWAC system if such Conversion Shares will be issued free of restrictive legends. 

 3.3 Ownership Cap . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holder shall not be entitled to receive shares representing Equity Interests upon conversion of this Note or as otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents to the extent (but only to the extent) that such conversion or receipt, as applicable, would cause the Holder Group (as defined below) to become, directly or indirectly, a beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of a number of Equity Interests of a class that is registered under the 1934 Act which exceeds the Maximum Percentage (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) of the Equity Interests of such class that are outstanding at such time. Any purported delivery of Equity Interests in connection with the conversion of this Note or as otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents prior to the termination of this restriction in accordance herewith shall be void and 

8 

have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in the Holder Group becoming the beneficial owner of more than the Maximum Percentage of the Equity Interests of a class that is registered under the 1934 Act that is outstanding at such time. If any delivery of Equity Interests owed to the Holder following conversion of this Note or as otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this limitation, the Company s obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and the Company shall deliver such Equity Interests as promptly as practicable after the Holder gives notice to the Company that such delivery would not result in such limitation being triggered or upon termination of the restriction in accordance with the terms hereof. To the extent limitations contained in this Section 3.3 apply, the determination of whether this Note is convertible and of which portion of this Note is convertible or whether Investor Shares are otherwise issuable shall be the sole responsibility and in the sole determination of the Holder, and the submission of a notice of conversion or other required issuance of Investor Shares shall be deemed to constitute the Holder s determination that the issuance of the full number of Conversion Shares or other Investor Shares requested in such notice is permitted hereunder, and the Company shall not have any obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. For purposes of this Section 3.3 , (i) the term Maximum Percentage shall mean 4.99 ; provided, that if at any time after the date hereof the Holder Group beneficially owns in excess of 4.99 of any class of Equity Interests in the Company that is registered under the 1934 Act or exempt from the registration and qualification requirements under the 1933 Act, then the Maximum Percentage shall automatically increase to 9.99 so long as the Holder Group owns in excess of 4.99 of such class of Equity Interests (and shall, for the avoidance of doubt, automatically decrease to 4.99 upon the Holder Group ceasing to own in excess of 4.99 of such class of Equity Interests); and (ii) the term Holder Group shall mean the Holder plus any other Person with which the Holder is considered to be part of a group under Section 13 of the 1934 Act or with which the Holder otherwise files reports under Sections 13 and/or 16 of the 1934 Act. In determining the number of Equity Interests of a particular class outstanding at any point in time, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding Equity Interests of such class as reflected in (x) the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) a more recent notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent to the Holder setting forth the number of Equity Interests of such class then outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days of such request, confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of Equity Interests of any class then outstanding as of the date of such request. The provisions of this Section 3.3 shall be construed, corrected and implemented in a manner so as to effectuate the intended beneficial ownership limitation herein contained. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or the other Transaction Documents, the Holder and the Company agree that nothing in the Transaction Documents shall require the Company to issue any Common Stock to Lender to the extent such issuance would result in the aggregate number of Investor Shares issued by the Company pursuant to the Transaction Documents (including any Incentive Shares) to exceed the Conversion Cap. 

 3.4 Adjustment of Conversion Price . 

 (a) To the extent there is any Outstanding Principal Amount under the Note, the Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows (but shall not be increased, other than pursuant to Section 3.4(a)(i) hereof):

If the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date effect a split or other subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price and Floor Price in effect immediately prior to the stock split shall be proportionately decreased. If the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date, combine the outstanding Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price and Floor Price in effect immediately prior to the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustments under this Section 3.4(a)(i) shall be effective at the close of business on the date the stock split or combination occurs. 

 (ii) Adjustments for Certain Dividends and Distributions . If the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date make or issue or set a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, then, and in each event, the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such event shall be decreased as of the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction: 

 (1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date; and 

 (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution. 

 (iii) Adjustment for Other Dividends and Distributions . If the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date make or issue or set a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in other than Common Stock, then, and in each event, an appropriate revision to the applicable Conversion Price shall be made and provision shall be made (by adjustments of the Conversion Price or otherwise), in each case, on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, so that the Holder of this Note shall receive upon conversions thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereon, the number of securities of the Maker or other issuer (as applicable) or cash or the fair market value of such other property (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors) that it would have received had this Note been converted into shares of Common Stock in full (without regard to any conversion limitations herein) on the date of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the Conversion Date, retained such securities (together with any distributions payable thereon during such period) or assets, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3.4(a)(iii) with respect to the rights of the holders of this Note. 

 (iv) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution . If the shares of Common Stock at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date shall be changed to the same or different number of shares or other securities of any class or classes of stock or other property, whether by reclassification, exchange, substitution or otherwise (other than by way of a stock split or combination of shares or stock dividends provided for in Sections 3.4(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) hereof, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets provided for in Section 

10 

3.4(a)(vii) hereof), then, and in each event, a corresponding revision to the Conversion Price shall be made and provisions shall be made (by adjustments of the Conversion Price or otherwise) so that the Holder shall have the right thereafter to convert this Note into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or other property receivable upon reclassification, exchange, substitution or other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Note might have been converted at the effective time of such reclassification, exchange, substitution or other change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. 

 (v) Adjustments for Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock . In the event the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date issue or sell any additional Common Stock Additional Common Stock ), other than (A) as provided in this Note (including the foregoing subsections (i) through (iv) of this Section 3.4(a) ), pursuant to any Equity Plan (including pursuant to Common Stock Equivalents granted or issued under any Equity Plan), (B) pursuant to Common Stock Equivalents (as defined below) granted or issued prior to the Issuance Date, (C) Exempted Securities, or (D) pursuant to the terms of this Note, in any case, at an effective price per share that is less than the Conversion Price then in effect or without consideration, then the Conversion Price upon each such issuance shall be reduced to a price equal to the consideration per share paid for such Additional Common Stock. For purposes of clarification, the amount of consideration received for such Additional Common Stock shall not include the value of any additional securities or other rights received in connection with such issuance of Additional Common Stock (i.e., warrants, rights of first refusal or other similar rights). 

 (vi) Issuance, Amendment or Adjustment of Common Stock Equivalents . Except for Exempted Securities, if (x) the Maker, at any time after the Issuance Date, shall issue any Convertible Securities or Common Stock Equivalents and the price per share for which Common Stock may be issuable pursuant to any such Common Stock Equivalent shall be less than the Conversion Price then in effect, or (y) the price per share for which Common Stock may be issuable under any Common Stock Equivalents is amended or adjusted, pursuant to the terms of such Common Stock Equivalents or otherwise, and such price as so amended or adjusted shall be less than the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such amendment or adjustment, then, in each such case (x) or (y), the applicable Conversion Price upon each such issuance or amendment or adjustment shall be adjusted as provided in subsection (v) of this Section 3.4(a) as if the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Common Stock Equivalents had been issued on the date of such issuance or amendment or adjustment. 

 (vii) Consideration for Stock . In case any Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents shall be issued or sold: 

 (1) in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the Maker is the surviving corporation (other than any consolidation or merger in which the previously outstanding Common Stock of the Maker shall be changed to or exchanged for the stock or other securities of another corporation), the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value, as determined reasonably and in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Maker and approved by the Holder, of such portion of the assets and business of the nonsurviving corporation as such Board of Directors may determine to be attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities, rights or warrants or options, as the case may be; or 

11 

(2) in the event of any consolidation or merger of the Maker in which the Maker is not the surviving corporation or in which the previously outstanding Common Stock of the Maker shall be changed into or exchanged for the stock or other securities of another corporation or other property, or in the event of any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Maker for stock or other securities or other property of any corporation, the Maker shall be deemed to have issued shares of Common Stock, at a price per share equal to the valuation of the Maker s Common Stock based on the actual exchange ratio on which the transaction was predicated, as applicable, and the fair market value on the date of such transaction of all such stock or securities or other property of the other corporation as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Maker. If any such calculation results in adjustment of the Conversion Price, or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Note, the determination of the Conversion Price or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Note immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or sale, shall be made after giving effect to such adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Note. 

 (viii) Record Date . In case the Maker shall take record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities, then the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be such record date.

 (e) Fractional Shares . No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of this Note. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Maker shall pay cash equal to such fractional shares multiplied by the Conversion Price then in effect.

The Maker shall, from time to time, use all commercially reasonable efforts to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock or take other effective action if at any time the unissued number of authorized shares shall not be sufficient to satisfy the Maker s obligations under this Section 3.4(f) . 

 (g) Regulatory Compliance .

If the Issuance Date of this Note is after the Closing Date, then, if the Conversion Price or any other right of the Holder of this Note would have been adjusted or modified by operation of any provision of this Note had this Note been issued on the Closing Date, such adjustment or modification shall be deemed to apply to this Note as of the Issuance Date as if this Note had been issued on the Closing Date.

In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder Conversion Shares or any other shares pursuant to a conversion on or before the Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such conversion (a Buy-In ), then the Company shall (a) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Conversion Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the conversion at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (b) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Note and equivalent number of Conversion Shares for which such conversion was not honored (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its conversion and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of 10,000, under clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts 

15 

payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

 3.8 Nasdaq Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the receipt of Stockholder Approval, the Holder shall not be entitled to receive shares representing Equity Interests upon conversion of this Note or as otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents to the extent (but only to the extent) that such conversion or receipt, as applicable, would cause the Holder Group to become, directly or indirectly, a beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of a number of Equity Interests of a class that is registered under the 1934 Act which exceeds the Conversion Cap.
