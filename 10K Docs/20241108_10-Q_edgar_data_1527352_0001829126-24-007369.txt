price of per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately . The Company intends to use the

Throughout
this report, the terms Nexalin, our, we, us, and the Company refer
to Nexalin Technology, Inc. 

Business
Overview 

Nexalin
is headquartered, and maintains its base of management and operations, in Houston, Texas. We design and develop innovative neurostimulation
products to uniquely and effectively help combat the ongoing global mental health epidemic. We developed an easy-to-administer medical
device referred to as Generation 1 or Gen-1 that utilizes bioelectronic medical technology
to treat anxiety, insomnia, and depression, without the need for drugs or psychotherapy. Our original Gen-1 devices are cranial electrotherapy
stimulation (CES) devices that emit waveform at 4 milliamps during treatment and are presently classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(the FDA as a Class II device. 

Medical professionals in the United States have
utilized the Gen-1 device to administer to patients in clinical settings. While the Gen-1 device had been cleared by the FDA to treat
depression, anxiety, and insomnia, three prevalent and serious diseases, because of the FDA s December 2019 reclassification
of CES devices, the Gen-1 device was reclassified as a Class II device for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. We are required to
file a new application under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 510(k) Application to be
approved by the FDA for the sales and marketing of our devices for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. In the FDA s December 2019
reclassification ruling, the treatment of depression with our device will require a Class III certification and require a new PMA (premarket
approval) and/or a new De Novo application to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

While
we continue providing services to medical professionals to support patients use of the Gen-1 devices which were in operation prior
to December 2019, we are not making new sales or new marketing efforts of Gen-1 devices in the United States. We continue to derive
revenue from devices which we sold or leased prior to the FDA s December 2019 reclassification announcements. This revenue
consists of monthly licensing fees and payments for the sale of electrodes and patient cables. We have suspended marketing efforts for
new sales of devices related to the Gen-1 device for treatment of anxiety and insomnia in the United States until the Nexalin regulatory
team decides on a new 510(k) application at 4 milliamps based on FDA comments expected to be received in late 2024. Our regulatory team
continues to inform the FDA of the suspension of the marketing and sale of the Gen-1 products to new providers. We are currently analyzing
whether to proceed with an amended application with the FDA for Gen-1 devices for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. 

The waveform that comprises the basis of our Generation
2 or Gen-2 and new Generation 3 or Gen-3 headset devices is in pre-submission for review
by the FDA for safety evaluation and eventual marketing in the United States. Determinations of the safety and efficacy of our devices
in the United States are solely within the authority of the FDA. We plan to conduct decentralized clinical trials for the Gen-3 device
in the U.S. and we continue to consult with the FDA as part of the pre-submission process. If and when we obtain FDA clearance for the
Gen-3 device, we intend to extend the development and commercialization of our devices for sale in the U.S. and other territories, given
the potential unmet demand for the treatment of mental health conditions with our device. 

We have designed and developed a new advanced
waveform technology to be emitted at 15 milliamps through new and improved medical devices referred to as Gen-2 and Gen-3. Gen-2 is a
clinical use device with a modern enclosure to emit the new 15 milliamp advanced waveform. Gen-3 is a new patient headset that will be
prescribed by licensed medical professionals in a virtual clinic setting similar to existing tele-health platforms. The Nexalin research
team believes that the new 15 milliamp Gen-2 and Gen-3 devices can penetrate deeper into the brain and stimulate associated structures
of mental illness, which we believe will generate enhanced patient response without any risk or unpleasant side effects. The Nexalin regulatory
team has made a strategic decision to develop strategies for pilot trials and/or pivotal trials in various mental health disease categories.
In addition, a new PMA application in the United States is in strategic development for the treatment of depression utilizing both Gen-2
and Gen-3. We plan to schedule additional pilot trials and/or pivotal trials for the new Gen-3 device for anxiety and insomnia in the
United States and China beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 . Preliminary data provided by The University of California,
San Diego and recent published data from Asia supports the safety of utilizing our 15 milliamp waveform technology. However, the determination
of safety and efficacy of medical devices in the United States is subject to clearance by the FDA. 

Currently, the waveform that comprises the basis
of Gen-2 and new Gen-3 headset devices has been tested in research settings to develop safety data that has been submitted for review
by the FDA for safety evaluation and eventual marketing in the United States and around the world. Determinations of the safety and efficacy
of our devices in the United States are solely within the authority of the FDA. 

A new pre-submission document in preparation of
a new 510(k) and/or De Novo application for our Gen-3 HALO headset at 15 milliamps was filed with the FDA in January of 2023. Formal comments
to our pre-submission document filing were received in March of 2023. A formal meeting to address FDA comments took place on May 9,
2023. 

A
second FDA pre-submission document was submitted on February 13, 2024. FDA comments to this second pre-submission document were
received on April 26, 2024. A formal teleconference was held with the FDA on April 30, 2024. The Nexalin regulatory team and
the FDA came to a consensus on the Anxiety and Insomnia Clinical research protocols. 

On
May 31, 2023, the Company formalized an agreement related to the formation of a joint venture established to engage in the clinical
development, marketing, sale and distribution of Nexilin s second generation transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation tACS devices Gen-2 devices in China and other countries in the region. The Joint Venture is registered in Hong Kong. 

Under
the Joint Venture Agreement, Wider Come Limited Wider ), a related party, is obligated to fund all operations for the
initial 12-month period of the Joint Venture, after which Nexalin and Wider plan to jointly fund the Joint Venture s operating
expenses in accordance with their pro rata ownership. The Joint Venture conducts research, development and clinical studies of our
devices, which supplements similar activities being conducted by Nexalin in the United States. The Joint Venture is responsible for
funding all clinical trial and development costs incurred in China. We share associated economic responsibility for these expenses
under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement. The Joint Venture may provide the financial resources for, and together with
our clinical studies conducted in the U.S. - serve as an important regulatory precursor towards the advancement of our efforts in
securing 510(k) and/or De Novo clearance from the FDA for our devices. 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have no employees or office in China and none of our operations are conducted
in China. The Joint Venture does not maintain any variable interest entity structure or operate any data center in China. 

The
Joint Venture is controlled by a Board of Directors in which Wider is to have sole representation but neither the Company nor Wider has
exclusive decision-making ability over day-to-day or significant operational decisions. Wider and Nexalin own and of the Joint
Venture, respectively. In accordance with ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures ASC 323 and ASC 810
- Consolidations ASC 810 ), the Company recognized and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of equity method investment income from the Joint Venture
on a one-quarter reporting lag, on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

The
investment in the Joint Venture is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023 the Company had an Equity Method Investment of and , respectively, recorded on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. The Company invested in the joint venture in September 2023 which is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2023 as an Equity Method Investment. Wider invested . In accordance with ASC 323, the Company uses the equity
method of accounting for its investment in the Joint Venture, an unconsolidated entity over which it does not have a controlling interest.
The equity method of accounting requires the investment to be initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Company s
share of equity in the unconsolidated entity s earnings or losses. The Company evaluates the carrying amount of this investment
in the Joint Venture for impairment in accordance with ASC 323. If the Company determines that a loss in the value of the investment
is other than temporary, the Company writes down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity in
income of unconsolidated entities in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company has
made an election to classify distributions received from the Joint Venture using the nature of the distribution approach. Distributions
received are classified as cash inflows from operating activities based on the nature of the activities of the unconsolidated entity. 

Continued
Nasdaq Listing 

Our
common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and
other continued listing requirements and standards, including the Minimum Bid Price Rule and Minimum Stockholder Equity Rule (each as
discussed below) and those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders equity,
and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing
standards. 

We
are required to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share. On May 10, 2023, the Company received written notice from The Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement
for continued listing on Nasdaq, as the closing bid price for the Company s common stock was below 1.00 per share as set forth
in the Nasdaq listing rules. The Company was afforded 180 calendar days, or until November 6, 2023, to regain compliance with the
Nasdaq listing rules. The Company was unable to regain compliance with the bid price requirement by November 6, 2023. 

The
Company requested a second 180-day period in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). On January 18, 2024, the
Nasdaq Hearing Panel granted the Company a temporary exception to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule until March 27,
2024, which date was further extended by the Panel until April 25, 2024. 

On
April 23, 2024, the Company received notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq s
minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). 

Under
the Nasdaq listing rules, we are also required to maintain stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000 (the Minimum Stockholder
Equity Rule ). In our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2024, we reported stockholders equity of 2,326,987.
On May 16, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that its stockholders 
equity as reported in such Quarterly Report did not satisfy the continued listing requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)
for the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Pursuant
to the Notice, the Company had 45 calendar days from the date of the Notice to submit a plan to regain compliance. On July 1, 2024,
the Company submitted a plan to Nasdaq. As described in the Company s submission to Nasdaq, and as set forth in
the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 3, 2024 , the Company consummated the public offering of
 million shares of the Company s Common Stock for total aggregate gross proceeds of approximately On July 23,
2024, the Company received written notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq, confirming that, based on the information
contained in the Company s Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on July 16, 2024, the Company is now in compliance with the Minimum
Stockholder Equity Rule. 

On
September 23, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule.
In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 calendar days, or until March 24, 2025, to regain compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least 1.00 per
share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On October 31, 2024, the Company received notice from Nasdaq notifying the
Company that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). 

 81.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company had a loss from operations of approximately ) 4.9 million and negative cash flows from operations of approximately ) 2.8
million. While the Company had a working capital surplus as of September 30, 2024 of approximately million, the Company s
operating activities consume most of its cash resources. 

The
Company expects to continue to incur operating losses as it executes its development plans, as well as undertaking other potential strategic
and business development initiatives through 2024 and through the twelve months from the date of this report. In addition, the Company
has had and expects to have negative cash flows from operations, at least into the near future. We previously funded these losses primarily
through the sale of equity . These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable perio d. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon our ability to execute on our business plan, including the ability to generate
revenue from the joint venture and obtain U.S. approval for the sale of our devices in the United States, and, if necessary, our ability
to raise additional capital. Although no assurances can be given as to our ability to deliver on our revenue plans or that unforeseen
expenses may arise, management has evaluated the significance of the conditions as of September 30, 2024 and have concluded that
we will not have sufficient cash and short-term investments to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months from
the issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

As
defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes
market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and
the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally
unobservable. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement). This fair value measurement framework applies at both initial and subsequent
measurement for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Employment
Development Department 

The
Company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the Employment Development Department (EDD) of the State of California. This
matter involves issues related to our previous management s classification of certain work provided to or on behalf of the Company s
business as contract labor instead of employee labor. The total amount involved was approximately 300,000. Management has petitioned
for reassessment and believes the hired workers at issue were indeed actual contractors and not employees. We have no business in California
other than one part time and one full time worker residing in California. The EDD approved a significant downward adjustment in our outstanding
employment tax liability to approximately 40,000 as reflected on its Statement of Account dated November 30, 2023. We plan to further
negotiate with the EDD and proceed with a settlement offer.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements
and related notes appearing in this Quarterly Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, our actual results could differ materially from the results
described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Forward-looking statements
represent our management s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Actual future results may be materially
different from what we expect. We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that
exist after the date on which they are made, except as required by applicable law. 

The
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Overview 

We
design and develop innovative neurostimulation products to uniquely and effectively help combat the ongoing global mental health epidemic.
We developed an easy-to-administer medical device referred to as Generation 1 or Gen-1 that utilizes bioelectronic medical
technology to treat anxiety and insomnia, without the need for drugs or psychotherapy. Our original Gen-1 devices are cranial electrotherapy
stimulation (CES) devices that emit waveform at 4 milliamps during treatment and are presently classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA as a Class II device. 

Medical
professionals in the United States have utilized the Gen-1 device to administer to patients in clinical settings. While the Gen-1 device
had been cleared by the FDA to treat depression, anxiety, and insomnia, three prevalent and serious diseases, because of the FDA s
December 2019 reclassification of CES devices, the Gen-1 device was reclassified as a Class II device for the treatment of anxiety
and insomnia. We are required to file a new application under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 510(k)
Application to be approved by the FDA for the sales and marketing of our devices for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. In
the FDA s December 2019 reclassification ruling, the treatment of depression with our device will require a Class III certification
and require a new PMA (premarket approval) application to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

While
we continue providing services to medical professionals to support patients use of the Gen-1 devices which were in operation prior
to December 2019, we are not making new sales or new marketing efforts of Gen-1 devices in the United States. We continue to derive
revenue from devices which we sold or leased prior to the FDA s December 2019 reclassification announcements. This revenue
consists of monthly licensing fees and payments for the sale of electrodes and patient cables. We have suspended marketing efforts for
new sales of devices related to the Gen-1 device for treatment of anxiety and insomnia in the United States until the Nexalin regulatory
team decides on a new 510(k) application at 4 milliamps based on FDA comments expected to be received in 2024. Our regulatory team continues
to inform the FDA of the suspension of the marketing and sale of the Gen-1 products to new providers. We are currently analyzing whether
to proceed with an amended application with the FDA for Gen-1 devices for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. 

We have designed and developed a new advanced
waveform technology to be emitted at 15 milliamps through new and improved medical devices referred to as Generation 2 
or Gen-2 and Generation 3 or Gen-3. Gen-2 is a clinical use device with a modern enclosure
to emit the new 15 milliamp advanced waveform. Gen-3 is a new patient headset that is designed to be prescribed by licensed medical professionals
in a virtual clinic setting similar to existing Tele-health platforms. The Nexalin research team believes that the new 15 milliamp Gen-2
and Gen-3 devices can penetrate deeper into the brain and stimulate associated structures of mental illness, which we believe will generate
enhanced patient response without any risk or unpleasant side effects. The Nexalin regulatory team has made a strategic decision to develop
strategies for pilot trials and/or pivotal trials in various mental health disease states. In addition, a new PMA application in the
United States is in development for the treatment of depression utilizing both Gen-2 and Gen-3. The new Gen-3 device is also scheduled
for additional pilot trials and/or pivotal trials for anxiety and insomnia in the United States and China beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2024. Preliminary data provided by The University of California, San Diego and recent published data from China supports the safety
of utilizing our 15 milliamp waveform technology. However, the determination of safety and efficacy of medical devices in the United
States is subject to clearance by the FDA. 

22 

Additionally,
a new pre-submission document in preparation of a new 510(k) and/or De Novo for our Gen-3 Halo headset at 15 milliamps was filed with
the FDA in January of 2023. Formal comments to our pre-submission document filing were received in March of 2023. A formal meeting to
address FDA comments took place on May 9, 2023. Minutes of the meeting with the FDA were filed with the FDA on May 16, 2023. 

A
second FDA pre-submission document was submitted on February 13, 2024. FDA comments to this second pre-submission document were
received on April 26, 2024. A formal teleconference was held with the FDA on April 30, 2024. The Nexalin regulatory team and
the FDA came to a consensus on the Anxiety and Insomnia Clinical research protocols. 

In
part due to the increasing incidence attributed to the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health and cognitive
disorders are widespread across the globe and cause substantial health, social and economic losses, and hardships accordingly. Our
focus is on the continued development of our innovative bioelectronic medical technologies and rapid regulatory approval. We intend
to help reverse these losses, and hardships of these losses, by safely and effectively treating various mental health disorders
associated with post Covid and long Covid mental disease states. 

All
our products are non-invasive, safe, undetectable to the human body and can provide relief to those afflicted with mental health issues
without adverse side effects. We have a proprietary design that stabilizes currents, electromagnetic fields, and various frequencies
 referred to collectively as a waveform - particularly our proprietary, 15 milliamp patented waveform. Additionally, our devices
generate a high frequency carrier wave for deeper penetration into the brain. It is applied to the brain with an array of electrodes
on the forehead and behind each ear at the mastoid. The features of this proprietary waveform and the array of electrodes allow the application
of the waveform to the entire brain rather than a small, targeted area of the brain. To ensure deeper penetration into the brain, we
have created a waveform that is undetectable to the brain which allows the increase of the power from 

Currently,
the waveform that comprises the basis of Gen-2 and new Gen-3 headset devices has been tested in research settings to develop safety data
that has been submitted for review by the FDA for safety evaluation and eventual marketing in the United States and around the world.
Determinations of the safety and efficacy of our devices in the United States are solely within the authority of the FDA. 

We
recognize that an additional barrier to treatment in today s mental health treatment landscape -- beyond the concerns about safety,
efficacy and side-effects that have been associated with conventional mental health treatments such as ECT (shock therapy), drugs and
psychotherapy is stigma. We have received industry reports and feedback that many patients that struggle with mood disorders
have the stigma of embarrassment associated with psychiatrists and psychotherapy (e.g., counselling with a therapist). Additional stigmas
and other issues are associated with the side effects of medication prescribed by psychiatrists. When we researched the current pharmaceuticals
model, public information highlighted the many side effects associated with these medications. Frequently, patients would stop taking
the medication because of the uncomfortable side effects. Additional public information mentions dependency and withdrawal issues associated
with medication for psychiatric disorders. 

23 

To
address the embarrassment stigma, we are developing a new virtual clinic that will allow the physician to diagnose a mental health issue
in the privacy of a tele-psychiatry virtual platform. After diagnosis, the physician will prescribe the Nexalin Gen-3 headset to the
patient for treatment. Next, the Gen-3 device will be shipped to the patient s home. After the patient receives the device, they
will pair the headset device with an app in the patient s smart phone. The app will communicate with the Nexalin cloud servers
to authorize the device for treatment according to the protocol designed by the physician. The physician will monitor treatment compliance
and other health related issues in a private physician dashboard that connects through the Nexalin app and cloud servers. We believe
that to preserve product safety and integrity for home use, the headset device will require physician oversight that will include a prescription
for use with a monthly authorization provided by the physician after a monthly virtual visit. All appointments will be in a virtual setting
to provide privacy and convenience for the physician and patient. The Nexalin virtual clinic will be provided in a proprietary virtual
platform currently in the design stage. 

Our
China Gen-2 15 milliamp device was approved in China by the NMPA for the treatment of insomnia and depression in China. This device and
all other clinical devices will include a single use electrode for long term revenue streams. The USA Gen-2 device will have a fresh
and modern appearance that meets the technology standards of the digital tech world of 2024. Early adopters of the Gen-1 device will
be able to access additional firmware upgrades which are planned to enhance the previously purchased devices to the new symmetric15-milliamp
waveform. Our Gen-2 device will be equipped with RFID technology that exchanges electrode usage data with a reader in the main device.
The purpose of RFID is to track and maintain control of the proprietary single use electrode. Our electrode chip will be programmed to
exchange data with the device and allow activation for a single treatment with a new electrode only. This ensures a recurring revenue
stream on the device and protects against any generic knockoffs designed to avoid treatment costs. This upgrade in technology also ensures
the proprietary nature of the electrodes that support treatment outcomes are sustained. 

Overall,
we believe that our advanced waveform, technological upgrades and the development of a modern headset monitored with our IT management
platform will position us with the opportunity to disrupt the traditional mental health treatment model. Our mission is to remove the
stigma of expensive psychotherapy or pharmaceuticals with the attendant side effects and dependency issues and replace such stigma with
clinically proven and cost-effective technology that is easily accessible in the privacy of the patient s home and monitored by
licensed healthcare providers. 

Since
our inception, we have generated significant losses; we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses
for at least the next two years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned
clinical trials and expenditures for other research and development activities. We expect our expenses will increase substantially over
time as we: 

continue the ongoing and
 planned preclinical and clinical development of our products; 

review and analyze the
 value of amending our previous 510(k) Application for anxiety and insomnia in accordance with the FDA; 

arrange for an outsourced
 sales, marketing and distribution model and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any product candidate for
 which we may obtain regulatory approval and intend to commercialize; 

maintain, expand and protect
 our intellectual property portfolio; 

engage additional clinical,
 scientific, manufacturing and controls personnel; 

add additional information
 systems including personnel to support our product development; 

Furthermore,
we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor
relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.

Recent
Developments 

Formalized
Joint Venture; China Related Activities; Approvals in Oman and Brazil 

On
May 31, 2023, the Company formalized an agreement related to the formation of a joint venture established to engage in the clinical
development, marketing, sale and distribution of Nexilin s second generation transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation tACS devices Gen-2 devices in China and other countries in the region. The Joint Venture is registered in Hong Kong. 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, (i) our operations are carried on outside of China; and (ii) the Joint Venture
does not maintain any variable interest entity structure or operate any data center in China. 

Under
the Joint Venture Agreement, Wider is obligated to fund all operations for the initial 12-month period of the Joint Venture, after which
Nexalin and Wider plan to jointly fund the Joint Venture s operating expenses in accordance with their pro rata ownership. 

The
Joint Venture is controlled by a Board of Directors in which Wider is to have sole representation but neither the Company nor Wider has
exclusive decision-making ability over day-to-day or significant operational decisions. Wider and Nexalin own 52 and 48 of the Joint
Venture, respectively. In accordance with ASC 323 and ASC 810, the Company recognized 159 and 0 for the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 and 4,651 and 0 of equity method investment income from the Joint Venture on a one-quarter reporting lag for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock to affiliates of Wider in satisfaction
of obligations pursuant to their collaborative agreement. A charge to research and development was recorded in 2023 at the time the Company
recognized its obligation to issue these shares. 

The
investment in the Joint Venture is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023 the Company had an Equity Method Investment of 100,651 and 96,000, respectively, recorded on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. The Company invested 96,000 in the joint venture in September 2023 and Wider invested 104,000. In accordance with ASC
323, the Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in the Joint Venture, an unconsolidated entity over which it
does not have a controlling interest. The equity method of accounting requires the investment to be initially recorded at cost and subsequently
adjusted for the Company s share of equity in the unconsolidated entity s earnings or losses. The Company evaluates the carrying
amount of this investment in the Joint Venture for impairment in accordance with ASC 323. If the Company determines that a loss in the
value of the investment is other than temporary, the Company writes down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses
are recorded to equity in income of unconsolidated entities in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss. The Company has made an election to classify distributions received from the Joint Venture using the nature of the
distribution approach. Distributions received are classified as cash inflows from operating activities based on the nature of the activities
of the unconsolidated entity. 

In
September of 2021, the China National Medical Products Administration (the NMPA ), the equivalent of the FDA, approved the
Gen-2 device for marketing and sale in China for the treatment of insomnia and depression. These treatment indications and clearances
from the NMPA have allowed Wider to market and sell the Gen-2 device in China for the treatment of insomnia and depression. 

25 

Our
participation in the Joint Venture with Wider in China is subject to general, as well as industry-specific, economic, political and legal
developments and risks in China. The Chinese government exercises significant control over the Chinese economy, including but not limited
to controlling capital investments, allocating resources, setting monetary policy, controlling and monitoring foreign exchange rates,
implementing and overseeing tax regulations, providing preferential treatment to certain industry segments or companies and issuing necessary
licenses to conduct business. In addition, we could face additional risks resulting from changes in China s data privacy and cybersecurity
requirements. Accordingly, any adverse change in the Chinese economy, the Chinese legal system or Chinese governmental, economic or other
policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations of the Joint Venture in China and our prospects generally. 

We
face additional risks in China due to China s historically limited recognition and enforcement of contractual and intellectual
property rights. We may experience difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights in China. If we cannot adequately monitor the
use of our technologies and devices or enforce intellectual property rights related to our devices in China or contractual restrictions
relating to use of our intellectual property by Chinese companies, our revenue could be adversely affected. 

The
Joint Venture with Wider is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There are uncertainties regarding
the interpretation and enforcement of laws, regulations and policies in China. Because many of the laws, regulations and policies applicable
to our operations in China are relatively new, the interpretations of such laws, regulations and policies are not always uniform. Moreover,
the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Enforcement
of existing laws or contracts may be uncertain. As a result of the foregoing, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable
enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. Our ability to monetize the Joint Venture in China may also be limited. 

The
Sultanate of Oman s Ministry of Health granted conditional approval for use of our Gen-2 device on June 16, 2022, effective
upon the end user of our device opening and operating a mental health care clinic being constructed in Oman. The Company s first
shipment of a device to Oman was made on January 30, 2024 and received in Oman on February 5, 2024 in connection with the opening
of the end user s clinic, rendering the approval effective. Two additional devices were shipped to Oman on February 29, 2024
and were received by the end user on March 6, 2024. Upon receipt of the two additional devices, the end user s clinic was
operational, and the use of the device to treat patients commenced pursuant to the approval. 

On
June 13, 2024, the Company announced that our Gen-2 device had been granted regulatory approval by the Brazilian Health Regulatory
Agency, a regulatory body of the Brazilian government responsible for approving new drugs and medical devices.

Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 36,031 and 24,113 respectively, of revenue primarily from the
sale of devices, supplies and from licensing and treatment fee agreements with our customers for which we charge a monthly licensing
fee for the duration of the agreement. We also generated revenue from treatment fee agreements by collecting fees based on the number
of treatments per month the customer performs. In addition, we derived revenue from equipment by selling electrodes and patient cables
to customers for use with our device. The increase in revenue for the three months ended September 30 2024 compared to 2023 was
primarily due to sales of supplies and parts. 

27 

Cost
of Revenues and Gross Profit 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues was 12,694 and 3,973, respectively, yielding a gross profit
of 23,337 and 20,140, respectively, or 64.77 and 83.52 , respectively. Such decrease in gross margin was due to the lower margins
on supplies and parts. 

Operating
Expenses 

Total
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2,531,854 and 2,435,677, respectively. The increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in shareholder related expenses of approximately 56,000,
an increase in professional fees of approximately 79,000, an increase in travel of approximately 34,000, and an increase in stock compensation
of approximately 1,466,000. These amounts were offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits of approximately 69,000 a decrease
in research and development costs of approximately 1,452,000 and a decrease in insurance of approximately 17,000. 

The
increase in shareholder related expenses was due to costs associated with investor relations. The increase in professional fees is due
to an increase in legal fees and an executive search professional fee of 60,000. The increase in travel is primarily due to costs associated
with meetings with our joint venture partners, staff visits to our Houston office and travel related to investor relations. The increase
in stock compensation is primarily related to compensating consultants with stock compensation upon shareholder approval of amending
the Company Equity Plan. The decrease in salaries is primary due to a bonus recorded in 2023. The decrease in research and development
costs are primarily related to costs associated with clinical trials not incurred in 2024. The decrease in insurance is due to a reduction
in our insurance premiums. 

Other
Income (Expense), Net 

Other
income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 60,101 and 118,348, respectively, consisting
of interest and dividend income, gain on the sale of short-term investments offset by interest expense. The decrease in other income
was due to a decrease in the amount available for investment.

Revenues 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 141,542 and 90,212 respectively, of revenue primarily from the
sale of devices, supplies and from licensing and treatment fee agreements with our customers for which we charge a monthly licensing
fee for the duration of the agreement. We also generated revenue from treatment fee agreements by collecting fees based on the number
of treatments per month the customer performs. In addition, we derived revenue from equipment by selling electrodes and patient cables
to customers for use with our device. The increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was
primarily due to the sales of devices to a new overseas customer. 

29 

Cost
of Revenues and Gross Profit 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues was 29,097 and 20,457, respectively, yielding a gross profit
of 112,455 and 69,755, respectively, or 79.44 and 77.32 , respectively. Such increase in gross margin was primarily due to device
revenue having a higher gross profit margin than that of other sources of revenue. 

Operating
Expenses 

Total
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4,991,695 and 4,141,578, respectively. The increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in shareholder related expenses of approximately 271,000,
an executive search professional fee of 60,000, an increase in travel of approximately 115,000, and an increase
in stock compensation of approximately 1,847,000. These amounts were offset by a decrease in research and development costs of
approximately 1,389,000, a decrease in taxes of approximately 21,000, and a decrease in insurance of approximately 57,000. 

The
increase in shareholder related expenses was due to costs associated with investor relations. The increase in stock compensation is primarily
related to compensating consultants with stock compensation upon shareholder approval of amending the Company Equity Plan. The increase
in travel is primarily due to costs associated with meetings with our joint venture partners, staff visits to our Houston office and
travel related to investor relations. The decrease in research and development costs are primarily related to costs associated with clinical
trials not incurred in 2024. The decrease in taxes is due to a reduction in our Delaware Franchise tax. The decrease in insurance is
due to a reduction in our insurance premiums. 

Other
Income (Expense), Net 

Other
income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 100,692 and 203,753, respectively, consisting
of interest and dividend income, gain on the sale of short-term investments offset by interest expense. The decrease is primarily due
to a decrease in gain on short term investments resulting from decreased short term investments.

Net
cash provided by (used in) financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4,516,184 and
 (200,000), respectively, which was due to the issuance of common stock for approximately 4.5 million from the July 1, 2024
offering. The September 30, 2023 use of cash was for a payment of note payable to an officer of the
Company. 

Uses
and Availability of Additional Funds 

Our
primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research and
development services, manufacturing development costs, legal and other regulatory expenses, and general administrative costs. Although
we have produced Gen-2, which is selling in China where it is approved for certain utilizations by medical practitioners, the successful
development of our future products is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated
costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of Gen-3 and obtain regulatory approvals. We are also
unable to predict when, if ever, net cash inflows from revenues will enable us to be cash flow positive. This is due to the numerous
risks and uncertainties associated with developing products, including, among others, the uncertainty of: 

successful enrolment in,
 and completion of clinical trials; 

performing preclinical
 studies and clinical trials in compliance with the FDA or any comparable regulatory authority requirements; 

the ability to outsource
 the manufacture of our products for development, clinical trials and/ or potential commercialization; 

obtaining and maintaining
 patent, trademark and trade secret protection for our products; 

scaling the commercial
 sales of products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

acceptance of existing
 therapies, and future therapies, if and when approved, by healthcare providers, physicians, clinicians, patients and third-party
 payors; 

competing effectively with
 other therapies; 

obtaining and maintaining
 healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement; 

protecting our rights in
 our intellectual property portfolio; and 

maintaining a continued
 acceptable safety profile of our products following approval. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a significant accumulated deficit of 81.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company had a loss from operations of 4.9 million and negative cash flows from operations of 2.8 million. The Company s
operating activities consume the majority of its cash resources. The Company will continue to service existing customers in the United
States. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating losses as it executes its development plans through 2024, as
well as other potential strategic and business development initiatives. In addition, the Company has had and expects to have negative
cash flows from operations, at least into the near future. The Company previously funded these losses primarily through the sale of equity.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately 4.6 million. 

31 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon our ability to execute on our business plan, including the ability to generate
revenue from the joint venture and obtain U.S. approval for the sale of our devices in the United States, and, if necessary, our ability
to raise additional capital. Although no assurances can be given as to our ability to deliver on our revenue plans or that unforeseen
expenses may arise, management has evaluated the significance of the conditions as of September 30, 2024 and have concluded that
we will not have sufficient cash and short-term investments to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months from
the issuance of these financial statements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company s discussion and analysis of
its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that
affect the amounts reported. Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards of the Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation
of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical
accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
August of 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations Joint Venture JV Formations: Recognition and
Initial Measurement. The guidance requires newly formed JVs to apply a new basis of accounting to all of its contributed net assets,
which results in the JV initially measuring its contributed net assets under ASC 805-20, Business Combinations. The new guidance would
be applied prospectively and is effective for all newly formed joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1,
2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements of this update and does not
expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The
ASU expands public entities segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided
to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description
of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets. All disclosure
requirements under ASU 2023-07 are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The ASU is effective on a retrospective
basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In
December of 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, establishes incremental
disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures. 

All
other newly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements have been deemed to be not applicable or immaterial to the Company.

Continued
Nasdaq Listing 

Minimum
Bid Price Requirement 

On
May 10, 2023, the Company received written notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company
that it was no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, as the closing bid price
for the Company s common stock was below 1.00 per share as set forth in the Nasdaq listing rules. The Company was afforded 180
calendar days, or until November 6, 2023, to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. The Company was unable to regain compliance
with the bid price requirement by November 6, 2023. 

The
Company requested a second 180-day period in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). On January 18, 2024,
the Nasdaq Hearing Panel granted the Company a temporary exception to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule until
March 27, 2024, which date was further extended by the Panel until April 25, 2024. On April 23, 2024, the Company
received notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement
under Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). 

On
September 23, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule.
In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 calendar days, or until March 24, 2025, to regain compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least 1.00 per
share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On October 31, 2024, the Company received notice from Nasdaq notifying the
Company that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). 

Minimum
Stockholder Equity Requirement 

Under
the Nasdaq listing rules, we are also required to maintain stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000 (the Minimum Stockholder
Equity Rule ). In our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2024, we reported stockholders equity of 2,326,987.
On May 16, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that its stockholders 
equity as reported in such Quarterly Report did not satisfy the continued listing requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)
for the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Pursuant
to the Notice, the Company had 45 calendar days from the date of the Notice to submit a plan to regain compliance. On July 1, 2024,
the Company submitted a plan to Nasdaq. As described in the Company s submission to Nasdaq, and as set forth in
the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 3, 2024 , the Company consummated the public offering of
3 million shares of the Company s Common Stock for total aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 5,250,000. On July 23,
2024, the Company received written notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq, confirming that, based on the information
contained in the Company s Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on July 16, 2024, the Company is now in compliance with the Minimum
Stockholder Equity Rule. 

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
Applicable. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

33 

Item 4.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures
are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based upon that evaluation, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
The material weaknesses identified to date include: (i) lack of sufficient resources necessary to provide adequate segregation of duties
related to the preparation and review of financial information used in financial reporting and review of controls over the financial
reporting process, including documentation of review of reconciliations; and (ii) insufficient IT controls which are effectively designed
and implemented, specifically related to user/superuser access to the Company s financial reporting system. 

As
of September 30, 2024, based on evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, management concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. To address our material weakness, we intend to engage an outside firm to advise on our financial
reporting processes and intend to implement new financial accounting controls and processes. We intend to continue to take steps to remediate
the material weakness described above through implementing enhancements and controls within our accounting systems, subject to budget
limitations. We will not be able to remediate these control deficiencies until these steps have been completed and have been operating
effectively for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively.
The redesign and implementation of improvements to our accounting and proprietary systems and controls may be costly and time consuming
and the cost to remediate may impair our results of operations in the future. 

In
light of the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at September 30, 2024, we have applied particular
procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting with respect to this quarterly report. Accordingly,
we believe, based on our knowledge that: (i) this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit a statement
of material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading with
respect to the period covered by this report; and (ii) the consolidated financial statements, and other financial information included
in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of
and for the periods presented in this quarterly report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
