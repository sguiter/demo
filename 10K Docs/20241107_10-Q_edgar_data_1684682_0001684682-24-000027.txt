The management fee for a certain month is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of that month and the immediately preceding calendar month. The determination of gross assets reflects changes in the fair market value of the Company s assets, which does not necessarily equal their notional value, reflecting both realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The base management fee may be reduced or deferred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement described below. For purposes of this calculation, Average Adjusted Capital for an applicable class is computed on the daily Adjusted Capital for such class for the actual number of days in such applicable month. Adjusted Capital is defined as cumulative proceeds generated from sales of the Company s shares of a particular share class (including proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan, if any), net of upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees sales load ), if any, reduced for the full amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to any share repurchase program, if any, and adjusted for share conversions, if any, for such class.

 The total return incentive fee is based on the Total Return to Shareholders (as defined below) for each share class in any calendar year, payable annually in arrears. The Company accrues (but does not pay) the total return incentive fee on a quarterly basis, to the extent that it is earned, and performs a final reconciliation and makes required payments at completion of each calendar year. The total return incentive fee may be reduced or deferred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement described below. For purposes of this calculation, Total Return to Shareholders for any calendar quarter is calculated for each share class as the change in the net asset value for such share class plus total distributions for such share class calculated based on the Average Adjusted Capital for such class as of such calendar quarter end. The terms Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders and Total Return to Founder Shareholders means the Total Return to Shareholders specifically attributable to each particular share class of Non-founder shares or Founder shares, as applicable. 
 The total return incentive fee for each share class is calculated as follows: 
 No total return incentive fee will be payable in any calendar year in which the annual Total Return to Shareholders of a particular share class does not exceed (the Annual Preferred Return ). 
 As it relates to the Non-founder shares, all of the Total Return to Shareholders with respect to each particular share class of Non-founder shares, if any, that exceeds the annual preferred return, but is less than or equal to , or the Non-founder breakpoint, in any calendar year, will be payable to the Manager Non-founder Catch Up ). The Non-Founder Catch Up is intended to provide an incentive fee of of the Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders of a particular share class once the Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders of a particular class exceeds in any calendar year. 
 As it relates to Founder shares, all of the Total Return to Founder Shareholders with respect to each particular share class of Founder shares, if any, that exceeds the annual preferred return, but is less than or equal to , or the founder breakpoint, in any calendar year, will be payable to the Manager Founder Catch Up ). The Founder Catch Up is intended to provide an incentive fee of of the Total Return to Founder Shareholders of a particular share class once the Total Return to Founder Shareholders of a particular class exceeds in any calendar year. 
 For any quarter in which the Total Return to Shareholders of a particular share class exceeds the relevant breakpoint, the total return incentive fee of a particular share class shall equal, for Non-founder shares, of the Total Return to Non-founder Shareholders of a particular class, and for Founder shares, of the Total Return to Founder Shareholders of a particular class, in each case because the annual preferred and relevant catch ups will have been achieved.

 The Expense Support amount is borne equally by the Manager and the Sub-Manager and is calculated as of the last business day of the calendar year. Until the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement is terminated, the Manager and Sub-Manager shall equally conditionally reduce the payment of fees and reimbursements of reimbursable expenses in an amount equal to the conditional waiver amount (as defined in and subject to limitations described in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement).

 (1) The per share amounts presented are based on weighted average shares outstanding. 
 (2) Expense Support (reimbursement) is accrued throughout the year and is subject to a final calculation as of the last business day of the calendar year. 
 (3) The amount shown at this caption is the balancing figure derived from the other figures in the schedule. The amount shown at this caption for a share outstanding throughout the period may not agree with the change in the aggregate gains and losses in portfolio investments for the period because of the timing of sales and repurchases of the Company s shares in relation to fluctuating fair values for the portfolio investments. 
 (4) The per share data for distributions is the actual amount of distributions paid or payable per common share outstanding during the entire period; distributions per share are rounded to the nearest 0.01. 
 (5) The computation of average net assets during the period is based on net assets measured at each month end, adjusted for capital contributions or withdrawals during the month. 
 (6) Total investment return is calculated for each share class as the change in the net asset value for such share class during the period and assuming all distributions are reinvested. Class FA assumes distributions are reinvested in Class A shares and all other share classes assume distributions are reinvested in the same share class, including Class S shares which do not participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. Amounts are not annualized and are not representative of total return as calculated for purposes of the total return incentive fee described in Note 5. Related Party Transactions. See footnote (8) below for information regarding the percentage of total incentive fees covered by expense support by share class for all periods presented. Since there is no public market for the Company s shares, terminal market value per share is assumed to be equal to net asset value per share on the last day of the period presented.

 (3) As of September 30, 2024, the senior debt investments in Lawn Doctor and Vektek accrue interest at a per annum rate of SOFR + 4.60 . SOFR at September 30, 2024 was 5.16 . 
 (4) Investment in portfolio company consists of minority equity interests only. 
 The portfolio companies are required to make monthly interest payments on their debt, with the debt principal due upon maturity. Failure of any of these portfolio companies to pay contractual interest payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operations, which would impact our ability to make distributions to shareholders. See our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding our portfolio companies and their related business activities. 
 Our Portfolio Companies 
 The below information regarding our portfolio companies contain a financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, utilized by management to evaluate the operating performance and liquidity of our portfolio companies that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as superior to or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or other financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to supplement our GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our portfolio companies. We present this non-GAAP measure quarterly for our portfolio companies in which we own a controlling equity interest and annually for all of our portfolio companies.

Table of Contents 

 You are encouraged to evaluate the adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA, including the reasons we consider this measure appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future our portfolio companies may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the future results of our portfolio companies will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies calculate this non-GAAP measure in the same manner. Because of these limitations and additional limitations described below, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure. 
 Additionally, we provide our proportionate share of each non-GAAP measure because our ownership percentage of each portfolio company varies. We urge investors to consider our ownership percentage of each portfolio company when evaluating the results of each of our portfolio companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 When evaluating the performance of our portfolio, we monitor Adjusted EBITDA to measure the financial and operational performance of our portfolio companies and their ability to pay contractually obligated debt payments to us. In connection with this evaluation, the Manager and Sub-Manager review monthly portfolio company operating performance versus budgeted expectations and conduct regular operational review calls with the management teams of the portfolio companies. 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of the performance of our portfolio companies because we believe it assists investors in comparing the performance of such businesses across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of their core operating performance. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus (i) interest expense, net, and loan cost amortization, (ii) taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain other non-recurring items that we do not consider indicative of the ongoing operating performance of our portfolio companies. These further adjustments are itemized below. Our proportionate share of Adjusted EBITDA is calculated based on our equity ownership percentage at period end. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness; (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; (v) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of the ongoing operations of our portfolio companies; and (vi) other companies in similar industries as our portfolio companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

 Other Portfolio Companies 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held minority equity and debt positions in four portfolio companies and held a minority equity position in one portfolio company. Two of these portfolio companies completed the following add-on acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 In May 2024, Blue Ridge ESOP Associates Blue Ridge acquired TSC 401K. TSC 401K is a premier third-party administration firm that offers expert retirement plan consulting, design, and administration solutions for businesses and their financial advisors. 
 In August 2024, USAW acquired AWR Services, Inc AWR ). Headquartered in Austin, TX, AWR provides utility management services to the water and wastewater industry. AWR is a strategic acquisition serving to broaden USAW s service capabilities, expand its geographic footprint, diversify its customer base, and contribute to increased scale of the business. 

Factors Impacting Our Operating Results 
 We expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors. Many of the factors that will affect our operating results are beyond our control. We will be dependent upon the earnings of and cash flow from the businesses that we acquire to meet our operating and management fee expenses and to make distributions. These earnings and cash flows, net of any minority interests in these businesses, will be available: 
 first , to meet our management fees and corporate overhead expenses; and 
 second , to fund business operations and to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 Size of assets 
 If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number and type of acquisitions we may make. The size of our assets will be a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our assets grows, the amount of income we receive will increase. In addition, our assets may grow at an uneven pace as opportunities to acquire assets may be irregularly timed, and the timing and extent of the Manager s and the Sub-Manager s success in identifying such opportunities, and our success in making acquisitions, cannot be predicted.

 Market conditions 
 From time to time, the global capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability, as we have seen and continue to see with the recent public health crises, natural disasters and geopolitical events, which could materially and adversely impact the broader financial and credit markets and reduce the availability of debt and equity capital. Furthermore, economic growth remains affected by inflationary pressure and supply chain related disruptions and could be slowed or halted by significant external events. Some of our portfolio companies have experienced supply chain related disruptions from time to time. In some instances, strategic decisions to hold more inventory have been made as a result of ongoing supply chain related disruptions. Significant changes or volatility in the capital markets have and may continue to have a negative effect on the valuations of our businesses and other assets. While all of our assets are likely to not be publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our assets are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an asset long term or through its maturity) and impairments of the market values or fair market values of our assets, even if unrealized, must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period, which could result in significant reductions to our net asset value for the period. Significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our assets. Thus, the illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our assets if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments, fund and maintain our assets and operations, repay borrowings, make distributions to our shareholders and other general business needs. We will use significant cash to fund acquisitions, make additional investments in our portfolio companies, make distributions to our shareholders and fund our operations. Additionally, to the extent we have available cash we may make investments in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. Our primary sources of cash will generally consist of: 
 the net proceeds from the Public Offerings; 
 distributions and interest earned from our assets; and 
 proceeds from sales of assets and principal repayments from our assets. 
 We expect we will have sufficient cash from current sources to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. However, we may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our shareholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our business strategy. In light of the current economic environment, impacted by rising interest rates, record inflationary pressures due to global supply chain issues, a rise in energy prices, and the impact of the recent public health crises, natural disasters and geopolitical events on the global economy, we are closely monitoring overall liquidity levels and changes in the business performance of our portfolio companies to be in a position to enact changes to ensure adequate liquidity going forward. 
 While we generally intend to hold our assets for the long term, certain assets may be sold in order to manage our liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. The timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any, cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 152.1 million and 134.5 million, respectively. 
 Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Offerings . We received approximately 170.5 million and 198.6 million in net proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the Initial Public Offering and the Follow-On Public Offering, which excludes approximately 13.1 million and 9.0 million raised through our distribution reinvestment plan, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 813 million authorized common shares remaining for sale. 
 Investments. We received a return of capital from portfolio company investments of approximately 2.4 million and 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received proceeds from sales and redemptions of U.S. Treasury bills of approximately 813.7 million, of which approximately 755.0 million was reinvested in new U.S. Treasury bills. We did not have any sale or redemptions of U.S. Treasury bills for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Expense Support is received or Expense Support reimbursement is paid annually. As of September 30, 2024, there is no remaining unreimbursed Expense Support under the terms of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. Our obligation to make Conditional Reimbursements will automatically terminate and be of no further effect three years following the date which the Expense Support amount was provided and to which such Conditional Reimbursement relates, as described further in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. No expense support was due from the Manager and Sub-Manager for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. See Note 5. Related Party Transactions of Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information.

 Distribution amounts and sources of distributions declared vary among share classes. We calculate each shareholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates. Distributions are declared on all classes of our shares at the same time. Amounts distributed to each class are allocated among the holders of our shares in such class in proportion to their shares. Distributions on the Non-founder shares may be lower than distributions on Founder shares because we are required to pay higher management and total return incentive fees to the Manager and the Sub-Manager with respect to the Non-founder shares. Additionally, distributions on Class T and Class D shares are lower than distributions on Class FA, Class A, Class I and Class S shares because we are required to pay ongoing distribution and shareholder servicing fees with respect to Class T and Class D shares. There is no assurance that we will pay distributions in any particular amount, if at all. 
 See Note 6. Distributions in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding distributions. 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders who purchase shares in the Public Offerings have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares having the same class designation as the class of shares to which such distributions are attributable, unless such shareholders elect to receive distributions in cash, are residents of Opt-In States, or are clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan. Opt-In States include Alabama, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Shareholders who are residents of Opt-In States, holders of Class FA shares and clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares. Cash distributions paid on Class FA shares are reinvested in additional Class A shares. Class S shares do not participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. 
 The purchase price for shares purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan is equal to the most recently determined and published net asset value per share of the applicable class of shares. Because the distribution and shareholder servicing fee is calculated based on net asset value, it reduces net asset value and/or distributions with respect to Class T shares and Class D shares, including shares issued under the distribution reinvestment plan with respect to such share classes. To the extent newly issued shares are purchased from us under the distribution reinvestment plan or shareholders elect to reinvest their cash distribution in our shares, we retain and/or receive additional funds for acquisitions and general purposes including the repurchase of shares under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 We do not pay selling commissions or dealer manager fees on shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. However, the amount of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee payable with respect to Class T or Class D shares, respectively, sold in the Public Offerings is allocated among all Class T or Class D shares, respectively, including those sold under our distribution reinvestment plan and those received as distributions. 
 Our shareholders will be taxed on their allocable share of income, even if their distributions are reinvested in additional shares of our common shares and even if no distributions are made.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 We adopted the Share Repurchase Program effective March 2019, as amended, pursuant to which we conduct quarterly share repurchases to allow our shareholders to sell all or a portion of their shares (at least 5 of his or her shares) back to us at a price equal to the net asset value per share of the month immediately prior to the repurchase date. The repurchase date is generally the last business day of the month of a calendar quarter end. We are not obligated to repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program. If we determine to repurchase shares, the Share Repurchase Program also limits the total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class FA, Class A, Class T, Class D, Class I and Class S shares to up to 2.5 of our aggregate net asset value per calendar quarter (based on the aggregate net asset value as of the last date of the month immediately prior to the repurchase date) and up to 10 of our aggregate net asset value per year (based on the average aggregate net asset value as of the end of each of our trailing four quarters). The Share Repurchase Program also includes certain restrictions on the timing, amount and terms of our repurchases intended to ensure our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Our board of directors has the right to amend or suspend the Share Repurchase Program to the extent it determines that it is in our best interest to do so, such as when repurchase requests would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations, risk having an adverse impact on us that would outweigh the benefit of repurchasing our shares or risk our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, upon 30 days prior notice to our shareholders. Once the Share Repurchase Program is suspended, the Share Repurchase Program requires that we consider the recommencement of the plan at least quarterly. Continued suspension of the Share Repurchase Program would only be permitted under the plan if our board of directors determines that the continued suspension of the Share Repurchase Program is in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. Our board of directors must affirmatively authorize the recommencement of the plan before shareholder requests will be considered again. Our board of directors cannot terminate the Share Repurchase Program absent a liquidity event or where otherwise required by law. We may provide notice by including such information in a current report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, each of which are publicly filed with the SEC followed by a separate mailing to our investors. Moreover, the Share Repurchase Program will terminate, and we no longer will accept shares for repurchase, if and when our shares are listed on a national securities exchange, are included for quotation in a national securities market or, in the sole determination of our board of directors, a secondary trading market for the shares otherwise develops. All shares to be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program must be (i) fully transferable and not be subject to any liens or other encumbrances and (ii) free from any restrictions on transfer. If we determine that a lien or other encumbrance or restriction exists against the shares requested to be repurchased, we will not repurchase any such shares. 
 The aggregate amount of funds under the Share Repurchase Program is determined on a quarterly basis at the sole discretion of our board of directors. At the sole discretion of our board of directors, we may use sources, including, but not limited to, offering proceeds and borrowings to repurchase shares. 
 To the extent that the number of shares submitted to us for repurchase exceeds the number of shares that we are able to purchase, we will repurchase shares on a pro rata basis, from among the requests for repurchase received by us based upon the total number of shares for which repurchase was requested and the order of priority described in the Share Repurchase Program. We may repurchase shares including fractional shares, computed to three decimal places. We have had no unfufilled share repurchase requests under the Share Repurchase Program since inception. 
 Under the Share Repurchase Program, our ability to make new acquisitions of businesses or increase the current distribution rate may become limited if, over any two-year period, we experience repurchase demand in excess of capacity. If, during any consecutive two year period, we do not have at least one quarter in which we fully satisfy 100 of properly submitted repurchase requests, we will not make any new acquisitions of businesses (excluding short-term cash management investments under 90 days in duration) and we will use all available investable assets (as defined below) to satisfy repurchase requests (subject to the limitations under the Share Repurchase Program) until all Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests have been satisfied. Additionally, during such time as there remains any Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests outstanding from such period, the Manager and the Sub-Manager will defer their total return incentive fee until all such Unfulfilled Repurchase Requests have been satisfied. Investable assets includes net proceeds from new subscription agreements, unrestricted cash, proceeds from marketable securities, proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan, and net cash flows after any payment, accrual, allocation, or liquidity reserves or other business costs in the normal course of owning, operating or selling our acquired businesses, debt service, repayment of debt, debt financing costs, current or anticipated debt covenants, funding commitments related to our businesses, customary general and administrative expenses, customary organizational and offering costs, asset management and advisory fees, performance or actions under existing contracts, obligations under our organizational documents or those of our subsidiaries, obligations imposed by law, regulations, courts or arbitration, or distributions or establishment of an adequate liquidity reserve as determined by our board of directors.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received requests for the repurchase of approximately 38.3 million and 15.6 million, respectively, of our common shares. Our board of directors approved the repurchase requests received.

 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
 Through September 30, 2024, we had acquired equity and debt investments in 16 portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our portfolio company investments totaled approximately 1,051.9 million and 779.0 million, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, we had invested in U.S. Treasury bills with a fair value of 50.0 million. We did not have any U.S. Treasury bills at September 30, 2024. See Portfolio and Investment Activity above for discussion of the general terms and characteristics of our investments, and for information regarding our portfolio companies.

 Investment Income 
 Investment income consisted of the following for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 From portfolio company investments: Interest income 10,333 9,436 30,221 24,277 Dividend income 6,634 5,017 15,675 15,624 PIK dividend income 1,490 1,490 From U.S. Treasury bills and cash accounts Interest and dividend income 1,221 1,468 4,367 3,844 Total investment income 19,678 15,921 51,753 43,745 
 Interest income from portfolio company investments is generated from our senior secured note investments, the majority of which had fixed rate interest as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our weighted average annual yield on our accruing debt investments was 14.2 , based on amortized cost as defined above in Portfolio and Investment Activity. Interest income from our debt investments was approximately 10.3 million and 9.4 million for quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 30.2 million and 24.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in interest income from portfolio company investments during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributable to new debt investments made during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 25.2 million. The increase in interest income from portfolio company investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributable new debt investments made during March 2023 through July 2024 and the additional debt investments made in existing portfolio companies on June 30, 2023 of approximately 54.5 million. 
 Dividend income from portfolio company investments is recorded on the record date for privately issued securities, but excludes any portion of distributions that are treated as a return of capital. Dividend income was approximately 6.6 million and 5.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and approximately 15.7 million and 15.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received dividend income from twelve and nine of our portfolio companies, respectively. 
 PIK dividend income from portfolio company investments is computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable agreement and are accrued and recorded as dividend income and added to the principal balance of the preferred equity. PIK dividend income was approximately 1.5 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. No PIK dividend income was recognized for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in PIK dividend income is primarily attributable to the new preferred equity investment made during June 2024. 
 Our total investment income, excluding our co-investment in LBR which is primarily accruing PIK dividends, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted in annualized cash yields ranging from 2.2 to 21.4 based on our investment cost, as compared to 4.3 to 19.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We stopped investing in U.S. Treasury bills by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective yield on U.S. Treasury bills ranged from 3.4 to 5.0 . We currently invest in an IntraFi Cash Service ICS account. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective yield on cash invested in the ICS account ranged from 4.5 to 5.0 . 
 We do not believe that our interest income, dividend income and total investment income are representative of either our stabilized performance or our future performance. We expect investment income to increase in future periods as we increase our base of assets that we expect to acquire from existing cash, borrowings and an expected increase in capital available for investment using proceeds from the Public Offerings.

 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total return incentive fees 5,174 3,743 14,932 8,710 Base management fees 4,802 3,505 13,028 9,342 Offering expenses 338 1,071 879 3,022 Professional services 851 490 2,435 1,501 Pursuit costs (159) 682 843 1,228 Distribution and shareholder servicing fees 334 310 971 873 Custodian and accounting fees 127 142 394 420 Insurance expense 56 51 159 157 Director fees and expenses 52 50 159 151 General and administrative expenses 104 115 325 423 Total operating expenses 11,679 10,159 34,125 25,827 Expense support 353 Reimbursement of expense support 644 Net expenses 12,032 10,159 34,125 26,471 
 We consider the following expense categories to be relatively fixed in the near term: insurance expenses and director fees and expenses. Variable operating expenses include total return incentive fees, base management fees, offering expenses, professional services, distribution and shareholder servicing fees, custodian and accounting fees, general and administrative expenses, and pursuit costs. We expect these variable operating expenses to increase in connection with the growth in our asset base (base management fees, total return incentive fees, accounting fees and general and administrative expenses), the number of shareholders and open accounts (professional services, distribution and shareholder servicing fees and custodian and accounting fees), and/or the complexity of our investment processes and capital structure (professional services). 
 Total Return Incentive Fee 
 The Manager and Sub-Manager are eligible to receive incentive fees based on the Total Return to Shareholders, as defined in the Management Agreement and Sub-Management Agreement, for each share class in any calendar year, payable annually in arrears. We accrue (but do not pay) the total return incentive fee on a quarterly basis, to the extent that it is earned, and perform a final reconciliation at completion of each calendar year. The total return incentive fee is due and payable to the Manager and Sub-Manager no later than ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the applicable calendar year. The total return incentive fee may be reduced or deferred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. 
 We recorded total return incentive fees of approximately 5.2 million and 3.7 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 14.9 million and 8.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in total return incentive fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to an increase in net investment income and an increase in the net change in unrealized appreciation on investments. 
 Base Management Fee 
 Our base management fee is calculated for each share class at an annual rate of (i) for the Non-founder shares, 2 of the product of (x) our average gross assets and (y) the ratio of Non-founder share Average Adjusted Capital for a particular class to total Average Adjusted Capital and (ii) for the Founder shares, 1 of the product of (x) our average gross assets and (y) the ratio of outstanding Founder share Average Adjusted Capital to total Average Adjusted Capital, in each case excluding cash, and is payable monthly in arrears. 
 We incurred base management fees of approximately 4.8 million and 3.5 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 13.0 million and 9.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in base management fees is primarily attributable to the increase in our average gross assets (excluding cash and U.S. Treasury bills) which were approximately 948.2 million and 702.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Offering Expenses 
 Offering expenses, which consist of amounts incurred for items such as legal, accounting, regulatory and printing work incurred related to the Public Offerings, are capitalized on our condensed consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as deferred offering expenses and expensed to our condensed consolidated statements of operations over the lesser of the offering period or 12 months; however, the end of the deferral period will not exceed 12 months from the date the offering expense is incurred by the Manager and the Sub-Manager. 
 We expensed offering expenses of approximately 0.3 million and 1.1 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 0.9 million and 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is due to lower incurred offering expenses by the Manager during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Pursuit Costs 
 Pursuit costs relate to transactional expenses incurred to identify, evaluate and negotiate acquisitions that ultimately were not consummated. We incurred pursuit costs of approximately (0.2) million and 0.7 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 0.8 million and 1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Distribution and Shareholder Servicing Fee 
 The Managing Dealer is eligible to receive a distribution and shareholder servicing fee, subject to certain limits, with respect to our Class T and Class D shares sold in the Public Offerings (excluding Class T shares and Class D shares sold through our distribution reinvestment plan and those received as share distributions) in an amount equal to 1.00 and 0.50 , respectively, of the current net asset value per share. 
 We incurred distribution and shareholder servicing fees of approximately 0.3 million and 0.3 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and approximately 1.0 million and 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses (consisting of professional services, insurance expense, custodian and accounting fees, director fees and expenses, and general and administrative expenses) were approximately 1.2 million and 0.8 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 3.5 million and 2.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Expense Support (Reimbursement) 
 We have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Manager and the Sub-Manager, pursuant to which each of the Manager and the Sub-Manager agrees to reduce the payment of base management fees, total return incentive fees and the reimbursements of reimbursable expenses due to the Manager and the Sub-Manager under the Management Agreement and the Sub-Management Agreement, as applicable, to the extent that our annual regular cash distributions exceed our annual net income (with certain adjustments). Expense Support is equal to the annual (calendar year) excess, if any, of (a) the distributions (as defined in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement) declared and paid (net of our distribution reinvestment plan) to shareholders minus (b) the available operating funds (the Expense Support ). The Expense Support amount is borne equally by the Manager and the Sub-Manager and is calculated as of the last business day of the calendar year. The Manager and Sub-Manager equally conditionally reduce the payment of fees and reimbursements of reimbursable expenses in an amount equal to the conditional waiver amount (as defined in and subject to limitations described in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement). The term of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement has the same initial term and renewal terms as the Management Agreement or the Sub-Management Agreement, as applicable to the Manager or the Sub-Manager.

Table of Contents 

 If, on the last business day of the calendar year, the annual (calendar year) year-to-date available operating funds exceeds the sum of the annual (calendar year) year-to-date distributions paid per share class (the Excess Operating Funds ), we will use such Excess Operating Funds to pay the Manager and the Sub-Manager all or a portion of the outstanding unreimbursed Expense Support amounts for each share class, as applicable, subject to the Conditional Reimbursements as described further in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. Our obligation to make Conditional Reimbursements shall automatically terminate and be of no further effect three years following the date which the Expense Support amount was provided and to which such Conditional Reimbursement relates, as described further in the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. 
 Since inception, we have received cumulative Expense Support of approximately 5.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded reimbursement of Expense Support of approximately 0.6 million. We reimbursed approximately 0.6 million and 2.4 million of Expense Support to the Manager and Sub-Manager for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there is no remaining amount of Expense Support to be collected from the Manager and Sub-Manager subject to reimbursement. Additionally, the Company did not record accrued expense support due from the Manager and Sub-Manager during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The actual amount of Expense Support or Expense Support Reimbursement is determined as of the last business day of each calendar year and is paid within 90 days after each year end per the terms of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement described above. See Note 5. Related Party Transactions of Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Other Expenses and Changes in Net Assets 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation on Portfolio Company Investments 
 
 Unrealized appreciation on portfolio company investments is based on the current fair value of our investments as determined by our board of directors based on inputs from the Sub-Manager and our independent valuation firm and consistent with our valuation policy, which take into consideration, among other factors, actual results of our portfolio companies in comparison to budgeted results for the year, future growth prospects, and the valuations of publicly traded and private comparable companies as determined by our independent valuation firm. 
 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net change in unrealized appreciation on our portfolio company investments of approximately 16.8 million and 53.3 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation on portfolio company investments included gross unrealized appreciation on eleven portfolio companies of approximately 64.3 million, offset partially by gross unrealized depreciation on four portfolio companies of approximately 11.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. One portfolio company investment has remained flat. Gross unrealized appreciation was due to EBITDA growth, accretive add-on acquisitions, multiple expansion in certain of our portfolio companies and unrealized foreign currency gain . Gross unrealized depreciation was primarily driven by EBITDA declines. Additionally, deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation of portfolio company investments offset unrealized appreciation on portfolio company investments by approximately 1.3 million and 2.6 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a net change in unrealized appreciation on portfolio company investments of approximately 14.1 million and 28.8 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation on portfolio company investments included gross unrealized appreciation on eight portfolio companies of approximately 45.6 million, offset partially by gross unrealized depreciation on three portfolio company of approximately 16.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. One portfolio company investment has remained flat. Gross unrealized appreciation was primarily due to EBITDA growth and accretive add-on acquisitions. Gross unrealized depreciation was primarily driven by EBITDA declines. Additionally, deferred taxes on unrealized appreciation of portfolio company investments offset unrealized appreciation on portfolio company investments by approximately 2.1 million and 4.2 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Assets 
 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net increase in net assets consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operations 23,176 17,728 68,365 41,850 Distributions to shareholders (9,676) (7,865) (27,697) (21,661) Capital transactions 54,111 66,913 143,903 191,992 Net increase in net assets 67,611 76,776 184,571 212,181 
 Operations increased by approximately 5.4 million and 26.5 million, respectively, during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to an increase in the net change in unrealized appreciation on investments of approximately 3.6 million and 26.2 million, respectively, and a increase in net investment income of approximately 1.9 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 Distributions increased approximately 1.8 million and 6.0 million, respectively, during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in shares outstanding. 
 Capital transactions decreased by approximately 12.8 million and 48.1 million, respectively, during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in capital transactions for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to an increase in share repurchases of approximately 5.0 million and 22.7 million, respectively, and a decrease in net proceeds received through the Follow-On Public Offering (including proceeds received through our distribution reinvestment plan) of approximately 7.8 million and 25.3 million, respectively. 
 Total Returns 
 The following table illustrates year-to-date YTD ), trailing 12 months One Year ), trailing 36 months Three Year ), Average Annual Return AAR ), trailing 60 months Five Year ), Average Annual Return AAR and cumulative total returns with and without upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees sales load ), as applicable. All total returns with sales load assume full upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Total returns are calculated for each share class as the change in the net asset value for such share class during the period and assuming all distributions are reinvested. Class FA assumes distributions are reinvested in Class A shares and all other share classes assume distributions are reinvested in the same share class. Management believes total return is a useful measure of the overall investment performance of our shares.

 We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our investments, other than those described above and the risk factors identified in Item 1A in Part I of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report, including the negative impacts from recent geopolitical events. 
 Our shares are illiquid investments for which there currently is no secondary market. Investors should not expect to be able to resell their shares regardless of how we perform. If investors are able to sell their shares, they will likely receive less than their purchase price. Our net asset value and total returns which are based in part upon determinations of fair value of Level 3 investments by our board of directors, not active market quotations are inherently uncertain. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data reported above. 

Hedging Activities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had not entered into any derivatives or other financial instruments. With respect to any potential financings, general increases in interest rates over time may cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase, and the value of our debt investments to decline. We may seek to stabilize our financing costs as well as any potential decline in our assets by entering into derivatives, swaps or other financial products in an attempt to hedge our interest rate risk. In the event we pursue any assets outside of the United States we may have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge any such foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities may have on our results of operations. 

Seasonality 
 We do not anticipate that seasonality will have a significant effect on our results of operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 See our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies of Part I of this Quarterly Report for a summary of our critical accounting policies. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We anticipate that our primary market risks will be related to the credit quality of our counterparties, market interest rates and changes in exchange rates. We will seek to manage these risks while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to shareholders to realize attractive returns through ownership of our shares. Many of these risks have been magnified due to the continuing uncertainties caused by the recent geopolitical events; however, while we continue to monitor the geopolitical events, its impact on such risks remains uncertain and difficult to predict. 
 Credit Risk 
 We expect to encounter credit risk relating to (i) the businesses and other assets we acquire and (ii) our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. We will seek to mitigate this risk by deploying a comprehensive review and asset selection process, including scenario analysis, and careful ongoing monitoring of our acquired businesses and other assets as well as mitigation of negative credit effects through back up planning. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Our debt investments are currently structured with fixed interest rates. Returns on investments that carry fixed rates are not subject to fluctuations in payments we receive from our borrowers, and will not adjust should rates move up or down. However, the fair value of our debt investments may be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. We may also invest in floating interest rate debt investments in the future.

Table of Contents 

 We had not borrowed any money as of September 30, 2024. However, to the extent that we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will be dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds may increase, which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 We hold investments that are denominated in British pounds that may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and British pounds. We may manage exposure to investments in foreign currencies by hedging such risks. As of September 30, 2024, we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments or other arrangements to hedge a change in exchange rate against the US dollar. We estimate that as of September 30, 2024, a 10 decline in the rate of exchange of British pounds against the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in the Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations of 6.4 million. 
 Additionally, some of the portfolio companies we invest in conduct business in foreign jurisdictions and therefore our investments have an indirect exposure to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the relevant SEC rules and forms. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the most recent fiscal quarter, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined under Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we and individuals employed by us may be party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our businesses. In addition, our business and the businesses of the Manager, the Sub-Manager and the Managing Dealer are subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings. Legal proceedings, lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and their ultimate outcomes are not predictable with assurance. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any legal proceedings. Additionally, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending before any court, or, to our knowledge, threatened by any regulatory agency or other third party, against the Manager, the Sub-Manager or the Managing Dealer that would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We have disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, risk factors which materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K . You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Repurchase of Shares 
 In March 2019, our board of directors approved and adopted a share repurchase program, as amended (the Share Repurchase Program ). The total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class FA, Class A, Class T, Class D, Class I and Class S shares will be limited to up to 2.5 of the aggregate net asset value per calendar quarter (based on the aggregate net asset value as of the last date of the month immediately prior to the repurchase date) and up to 10 of the aggregate net asset value per year (based on the average aggregate net asset value as of the end of each of the Company s trailing four quarters). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the sole discretion of our board of directors, we may also use other sources, including, but not limited to, offering proceeds and borrowings to repurchase shares. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the Share Repurchase Program or waive any of its specific conditions to the extent it is in our best interest, including to ensure our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased the following shares (in thousands except per share data): 
 Period Total Number of Shares Repurchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plan Maximum Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plan (1)
