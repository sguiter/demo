 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER
30, 2024 

on , under the name of Telemax Communications. On or about July 24, 2003,
the name was changed to Healthmed Services Ltd. The Company had no operations and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) Topic 915 was considered to be in the development stage. 

On
April 16, 2021, Fastbase, Inc., a Nevada corporation Fastbase ), and SCI Inc. entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with
Mr. James Shipley, the owner shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in Trustfeed Corp. Trustfeed or
 Company for the purchase of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for cash consideration of 
USD. Mr. Shipley agreed to cancel shares in the process. The transaction closed on April 21, 2021. 

On
September 14, 2021, Trustfeed entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement with Fastbase for the
acquisition of certain assets of Fastbase in exchange for shares of super voting preferred stock in the Company. The assets were associated
with Fastbase s review platform giving access to information about products, which includes proprietary software to crawl, organize,
verify, with A.I. rendering, algorithms to do data mining, and an A.I. rendering database of companies, websites, contacts and approximately
500,000 products descriptions. The Company paid for the assets contributed by issuing to Fastbase shares of the Company s
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result of these transactions, there was a change in control of the Company and Fastbase acquired
voting control over all aspects of the Company, including the election of directors, and other corporate actions of the Company that
require shareholder approval. 

On
September 2, 2022, Trustfeed conducted a . On the market effective date of the reverse split, September 2, 2022,
there were a total of issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In addition to the reverse split, the Company changed its
name to Trustfeed Corp. 

On
November 4, 2022: 

Trustfeed cancelled all
 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, save shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which were outstanding
 and then held by Fastbase. 

Trustfeed reduced its authorized
 shares of common stock, par value per share, from shares to shares. Trustfeed also reduced the authorized
 shares of preferred stock, par value per share, from shares to shares. As of November 4, 2022, Trustfeed
 had authorized shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock, each with par value of per share. 

Trustfeed amended and restated
 its Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock to reduce the number of authorized shares of preferred stock designated
 and available from shares to shares, with the same conversion ratio of shares of common stock for every share
 of Series A Preferred Stock. 

Trustfeed filed Certificates
 of Withdrawal in Nevada to withdraw the Certificates of Designation for Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock. Following
 the transaction, the only designated and outstanding shares of preferred stock are the Company s Series A Preferred Stock. 

Historically,
Trustfeed was in the business of acquiring, leasing, and licensing growers for the cultivation and production (processing and distribution
of cannabis and cannabis-related products within an incubator environment). The Company was also in the business of renewable fresh water
and real estate. As a result of the change in ownership of the Company in 2021 by Fastbase, the Company became a technology company with
access to a global database of information to provide consumers with trusted information about the companies they do business with (the
 Pre-Existing Business ). 

However,
effective as of December 29, 2023 in accordance with a Stock Purchase Agreement, Fastbase, the then record and beneficial owner of (i)
 shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing approximately of Trustfeed s issued and outstanding Common Stock
(the Common Shares ), and (ii) shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per share, of
Trustfeed, representing of the Trustfeed s issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (the Preferred Shares 
and, with the Common Shares, the Transferred Shares ), sold the Transferred Shares to CWR 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company CWR for aggregate consideration of (collectively referred to as the Transaction ). Additionally,
Trustfeed s then Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal financial officer)
and Chairman and sole member of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), resigned from all director (as of February
12, 2024), officer and employment positions with Trustfeed and its subsidiaries. 

Also
as of December 29, 2023, the size of the Board was increased from one director to two directors and Brett Rosen was appointed as a director
to fill the vacancy, to serve as director until the next annual meeting of stockholders of Trustfeed, and Mr. Rosen was appointed President,
Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of Trustfeed. 

Upon
the consummation of the Transaction on December 29, 2023, Trustfeed experienced a change in control. The Transaction and related transactions
had the following consequences: 

New management anticipated
 entering into a future transaction involving the Company, which could result in the acquisition of one or more businesses, companies
 or asset classes, including but not limited to intellectual property assets and that may be owned by affiliates of management. 

The Company s new
 management evaluated the Company s Pre-Existing Business as part of these possible future transactions, and had suspended operations
 relating to the Pre-Existing Business, with the expectation of permanently shutting down, spinning off or assigning the Pre-Existing
 Business at the time of such future transaction(s). 

Effective
as of March 21, 2024, Brett Rosen resigned from all of his officer and director positions with the Company, and he was replaced in all
such positions by Terrence M. Tierney. In furtherance of Mr. Tierney s appointment as the Company s sole executive officer,
the Company, Mr. Tierney and an affiliate of Mr. Tierney, have entered into a Professional Services Agreement (the Services Agreement ).
Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, among other things, Mr. Tierney, directly or through his affiliate, will fill the role
of President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company and otherwise act as the Company s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer. 

The
term of the Agreement was for an initial term ending on the earlier of five months from the effective date or the filing of the Company s
Form 10-Q for the accounting period ending June 30, 2024, and it may be extended by mutual consent or earlier terminated in the event
of certain cause events as specified in the Agreement. 

Merger
Agreement 

On
June 28, 2024, Trustfeed, Polomar Acquisition, L.L.C., a Florida limited liability company, and wholly owned subsidiary of Trustfeed Merger Sub and Polomar Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, a Florida limited liability company Polomar entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger
Sub will merge with and into Polomar, with Polomar continuing as the surviving company (the
 Surviving Company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Trustfeed (the Merger ). 

At
the effective time of the Merger on September 30, 2024 (the Effective Time ), each shares of Company Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock, and returned for
cancellation shares of the Company s common stock for cancellation . Affiliates of CWR 1 or other related parties owned
a majority of the membership interests of Polomar immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

On
September 30, 2024, the Merger and the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement were consummated. The Merger is considered
a reverse merger as the historical financial statements of Polomar, the accounting acquirer, have been substituted for
the historical financial statements of Trustfeed. As a result of the Merger, the Company ceased commercializing the Pre-Existing Business. 

As
a result of the Merger, the Company operates Polomar Specialty Pharmacy, a State of Florida licensed retail compounding pharmacy, located
in Palm Harbor, FL, pursuant to license # PH35196. Polomar Specialty Pharmacy is also licensed as a Special Sterile Compounding Pharmacy,
permit #PH35277, which authorizes the licensed entity to dispense injectable and other sterile compounds (eye drops, infused therapeutics)
upon receipt of a valid prescription. The compounding facility operates pursuant to guidelines established under Sec. 503A Compounding
Pharmacy of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 503A authorizes the licensed entity to manufacture compounded drugs
and fulfill prescriptions provided to it by licensed physicians. As a result, the Company is presently authorized to fulfill and deliver
compounded prescribed medications in 28 states. The Company is also actively seeking approval and authorization in other states and expects
to be able to provide prescription medications in a majority of U.S. states by the end of 2025. The Company also anticipates applying
for a drug export permit in early 2025. 

As
part of the Merger, the Company acquired SlimRx TM (slimrx.com), a weight loss focused online platform that connects patients
with licensed physicians to prescribe weight loss medications such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus) and while originally, the
Company expected to fulfill tirzepatide (Monjouro, Zepbound) prescriptions through SlimRx, since the Food and Drug Administration removed
tirzepatide from its drug shortage list, the Company no longer intends to fulfill prescriptions for that drug. SlimRx filed an application
for statutory trademark protection on August 29, 2024. The prescriptions issued via SlimRx are fulfilled by the Company. The Company
also expects to launch PoloMeds TM (polomeds.com) during the fourth quarter of 2024 to fulfill prescriptions for diabetes medications
including metformin compounds, sulfonylureas, and insulin; compounded erectile dysfunction medications sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil
(Cialis) and Polomar s prescription only, exclusive dermatological formulations co-developed by a board-certified dermatologist
for the treatment of acne, alopecia areata, basal cell carcinoma, Becker s nevus, vitiligo, and other common skin conditions. 

An
integral part of the Company s business model is to provide prescription fulfillment services for third party web based tele-health
platforms. This wholesale part of the business is expected to experience steady growth over the next twelve to eighteen
months. 

Merger
Valuation 

The
Company utilized the following process to determine the fair market value of for the acquisition of all of Polomar Specialty
Pharmacy s intellectual property, intangible assets and plant and equipment. 

We
utilized a three-step process to determine the fair value of Synergistic Equity Value of the Company: 

1.
we determined the aggregate equity value of Polomar. After due consideration of all appropriate and generally accepted valuation methodologies,
our analysis has been developed primarily on the basis of: (i) the market approach, specifically the guideline public company method;
and (ii) the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. 

2.
we determined the aggregate equity value of Trustfeed. After due consideration of all appropriate and generally accepted valuation methodologies,
our analysis has been developed primarily on the basis of: (i) the asset-based approach, specifically the adjusted book value method. 

3.
we added the fair value of equity of Trustfeed and Polomar arrive at the Fair Value of Synergistic Equity Value of the Company. 

We
used a two-step process to determine the fair value of the Transaction Consideration: 

1.
we divided the fair value of Synergistic Equity Value of the Company by Trustfeed s postclosing shares outstanding to arrive at
the per share equity value of the Company. 

2.
we multiplied the per share equity value by the number of shares owned by current Company shareholders to arrive at the fair value of
Transaction Consideration. 

License
Agreement 

On
June 29, 2024, Trustfeed executed a Know How and Patent License Agreement (the Agreement with Pinata Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation Pinata ), to license from Pinata certain patent pending intellectual property rights and know how
(the IP Rights regarding the proprietary delivery of products containing metformin, sumatriptan, semaglutide, liraglutide
and sildenafil (the Ingredients ). The license is worldwide, non-exclusive and non-transferable but may be sub-licensed
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. 

The
Company shall be obligated to pay a royalty to Pinata ranging from ten percent to twenty percent of the net sales from products
utilizing the IP Rights containing the Ingredients. 

The
Agreement has a perpetual term, subject to the right of either party to terminate (a) if the other party commits a material breach of
its obligations under the Agreement and fails to cure such breach and (b) at any time upon 180 days prior written notice to the other
party. 

It
is the Company s intention to utilize the IP Rights in products expected to be manufactured and distributed by it. 

Pinata
is an affiliate of CWR. 

License
Agreement Valuation 

As
of the date of this filing the Company has not utilized any of the licensed intellectual property and has incurred no expenses or realized
any revenues from the license agreement. The Company presently values this agreement at - -. 

Additional
Corporate Actions 

On
July 11, 2024, CWR, then a majority holder of Trustfeed s voting stock, and the board of directors of the Company, approved the
following corporate actions: 

1. 
 To
 authorize and approve an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the Existing
 Articles ), to effect a change of name from Trustfeed Corp. to Polomar Health Services,
 Inc. . 

2. 
 To authorize and approve
 an amendment to the Existing Articles to effect an increase in the number of authorized shares of the Company s blank
 check preferred stock to . 

3. 
 To authorize, but not require,
 an amendment to the Existing Articles, to effect a reverse stock split with a ratio of . 

4. 
 To
 adopt the Company s Certificate of Amendment to the Existing Articles, which makes no material changes to the
 Company s Existing Articles other than incorporating the amendments described in Actions (1), (2) and (3) above. 

5. 
 To adopt the Company s
 2024 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the Incentive Plan ). 

As
of the Balance Sheet date, none of the foregoing corporate actions have been implemented other than the adoption of the Incentive Plan. 

t have any cash equivalents
as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. 

Level
2 - Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability
through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life. 

Level
3 - Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement
date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. Valuation
of instruments includes unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets
or liabilities. 

As
defined by ASC 820, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, which was further clarified as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. 

The
reported fair values for financial instruments that use Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine fair value are based on a variety of
factors and assumptions. Accordingly, certain fair values may not represent actual values of the Company s financial instruments
that could have been realized as of March 31, 2024, or that will be recognized in the future, and do not include expenses that could
be incurred in an actual settlement. The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts
receivable, receivables from related parties, prepaid expenses and other, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and related party and
third-party notes payables approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The Company s notes payable to related
parties approximates the fair value of such instrument based upon management s best estimate of terms that would be available to
the Company for similar financial arrangements at September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. 

cash on hand. As of September 30,
2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of .
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of and
cash used in operations of .
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date
of filing. 

Over
the next twelve months, management plans to raise additional capital and to invest its working capital resources in its newly acquired
business from Polomar and in other potential business opportunities. However, there is no guarantee the Company will raise sufficient
capital to continue operations. The condensed unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if
the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

from a related party for payment of
operating expenses, as follows: 

On
August 13, 2024, Reprise Management, Inc., a California corporation affiliated with CWR Reprise ), issued an unsecured
promissory note to Polomar (the Polomar Note ), pursuant to which Polomar could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount
of . The Polomar Note bears per annum, simple interest up to and through December 31, 2024 (the Initial Period ),

Company
Overview 

We
were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2000, under the name of Telemax Communications. On or about July 24, 2003,
the name was changed to Healthmed Services, Ltd. The Company had no operations and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) Topic 915 was considered to be in the development stage. 

On
April 16, 2021, Fastbase, Inc., a Nevada corporation Fastbase ), and SCI Inc. entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with
Mr. James Shipley, the owner 50,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, for the purchase of 4,750,000 shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock for cash consideration of 108,200. Mr. Shipley agreed to cancel 45,000,000 shares in the process. The
transaction closed on April 21, 2021. 

On
September 14, 2021, the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement with Fastbase for the
acquisition of certain assets of Fastbase in exchange for shares of super voting preferred stock in the Company. The assets were associated
with Fastbase s review platform giving access to information about products, which includes proprietary software to crawl, organize,
verify, with A.I. rendering, algorithms to do data mining, and an A.I. rendering database of companies, websites, contacts and approximately
500,000 products descriptions. The Company paid for the assets contributed by issuing to Fastbase 45,000,000 shares of the Company s
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result of these transactions, there was a change in control of the Company and Fastbase acquired
voting control over all aspects of the Company, including the election of directors, and other corporate actions of the Company that
require shareholder approval. 

On
September 2, 2022, the Company conducted a reverse split in which each shareholder was issued one common share in exchange for every
two thousand common shares of their then-currently issued common stock. On the market effective date of the reverse split, September
2, 2022, there were a total of 266,157 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In addition to the reverse split, the Company changed
its name to Trustfeed Corp. 

4 

Also
on November 4, 2022: 

The Company cancelled all
 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, save 500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which were outstanding
 and then held by Fastbase. 

The Company reduced its
 authorized shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, from 1,000,000,000 shares to 295,000,000 shares. Polomar also reduced
 the authorized shares of preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share, from 75,000,000 shares to 500,000 shares. As of November 4,
 2022, Polomar had authorized 295,000,000 shares of common stock and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, each with par value of 0.001
 per share. 

The Company amended and
 restated its Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock to reduce the number of authorized shares of preferred stock
 designated and available from 50,000,000 shares to 500,000 shares, with the same conversion ratio of 20 shares of common stock for
 every share of Series A Preferred Stock. 

The Company filed Certificates
 of Withdrawal in Nevada to withdraw the Certificates of Designation for Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock. Following
 the transaction, the only designated and outstanding shares of preferred stock are the Company s Series A Preferred Stock. 

Historically,
we were in the business of acquiring, leasing, and licensing growers for the cultivation and production (processing and distribution
of cannabis and cannabis-related products within an incubator environment). The Company was also in the business of renewable fresh water
and real estate. As a result of the change in ownership of the Company in 2021 by Fastbase, the Company became a technology company with
access to a global database of information to provide consumers with trusted information about the companies they do business with (the
 Pre-Existing Business ). 

However,
effective as of December 29, 2023 in accordance with a Stock Purchase Agreement, Fastbase, the then record and beneficial owner of (i)
90,437,591 shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing approximately 83 of the Company s issued and outstanding Common
Stock (the Common Shares ), and (ii) 500,000 shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value .001 per share,
of the Company, representing 100 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (the Preferred Shares 
and, with the Common Shares, the Transferred Shares ), sold the Transferred Shares to CWR 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
Company CWR for aggregate consideration of 350,000 (collectively referred to as the Transaction ). Additionally,
Rasmus Refer, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal
financial officer) and Chairman and sole member of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), resigned from all
director (as of February 12, 2024), officer and employment positions with the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Also
as of December 29, 2023, the size of the Board was increased from one director to two directors and Brett Rosen was appointed as a director
to fill the vacancy, to serve as director until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, and Mr. Rosen was appointed President,
Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. 

Upon
the consummation of the Transaction on December 29, 2023, the Company experienced a change in control. The Transaction and related transactions
had the following consequences: 

New management anticipated
 entering into a future transaction involving the Company, which could result in the acquisition of one or more businesses, companies
 or asset classes, including but not limited to intellectual property assets and that may be owned by affiliates of management. 

The Company s new
 management evaluated the Company s Pre-Existing Business as part of these possible future transactions, and had suspended our
 operations relating to the Pre-Existing Business, with the expectation of permanently shutting down, spinning off or assigning the
 Pre-Existing Business at the time of such future transaction(s). 

5 

Effective
as of March 21, 2024, Brett Rosen resigned from all of his officer and director positions with the Company, and he was replaced in all
such positions by Terrence M. Tierney. 

Merger
Agreement 

On
June 28, 2024, the Company, Polomar Acquisition, L.L.C., a Florida limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub and Polomar Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, a Florida limited liability company Polomar entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (as amended on September 30, 2024, the Merger Agreement ), pursuant to
which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Polomar, with Polomar continuing
as the surviving company (the Surviving Company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ). 

At
the effective time of the Merger on September 30, 2024 (the Effective Time ), each 1 of the outstanding membership interest
of Polomar will be automatically converted into the right to receive 2,074,141.47 shares
of Company common stock (the Exchange Ratio ). Following the consummation of the Merger, at the Effective Time, former members
of Polomar owned an aggregate of 75 of the Company and then-existing stockholders of the Company owned an aggregate of 25 of the Company.
At or prior to the Effective Time, CWR 1, LLC, the Company s then-majority owner with an 83.3 beneficial ownership stake in the
Company, converted its 500,000 shares of Company Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 10,000,000 shares of Company common stock,
and returned for cancellation 50,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock for cancellation. Affiliates or other related parties
of CWR owned a majority of the membership interests of Polomar immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

On
September 30, 2024, the Merger and the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement were consummated. The Merger is considered
a reverse merger as the historical financial statements of Polomar, the accounting acquirer, have been substituted for
the historical financial statements of Trustfeed. As a result of the Merger, the Company ceased commercializing the Pre-Existing Business
and now operates Polomar Specialty Pharmacy, a State of Florida licensed retail compounding pharmacy, located in Palm Harbor, FL, pursuant
to license # PH35196. Polomar Specialty Pharmacy is also licensed as a Special Sterile Compounding Pharmacy, permit #PH35277, which authorizes
the licensed entity to dispense injectable and other sterile compounds (eye drops, infused therapeutics) upon receipt of a valid prescription.
The compounding facility operates pursuant to guidelines established under Sec. 503A Compounding Pharmacy of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 503A authorizes the licensed entity to manufacture compounded drugs and fulfill prescriptions provided
to it by licensed physicians. As a result, the Company is presently authorized to fulfill and deliver compounded prescribed medications
in 28 states. The Company is also actively seeking approval and authorization in other states and expects to be able to provide prescription
medications in a majority of U.S. states by the end of 2025. The Company also anticipates applying for a drug export permit in early
2025. 

As
part of the Merger, the Company acquired SlimRx TM (slimrx.com), a weight loss focused online platform that connects
patients with licensed physicians to prescribe weight loss medications such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus) and while
originally, the Company expected to fulfill tirzepatide (Monjouro, Zepbound) prescriptions through SlimRx, since the Food and Drug
Administration removed tirzepatide from its drug shortage list, the Company no longer intends to fulfill prescriptions for that
drug. SlimRx filed an application for statutory trademark protection on August 29, 2024. The prescriptions issued via SlimRx are
fulfilled by the Company. The Company also expects to launch PoloMeds TM (polomeds.com) during the fourth quarter of 2024
to fulfill prescriptions for diabetes medications including metformin compounds, sulfonylureas, and insulin; compounded erectile
dysfunction medications sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis) and Polomar s prescription only, exclusive dermatological
formulations co-developed by a board-certified dermatologist for the treatment of acne, alopecia areata, basal cell carcinoma,
Becker s nevus, vitiligo, and other common skin conditions. 

An
integral part of the Company s business model is to provide prescription fulfillment services for third party web based tele-health
platforms. This wholesale part of the business is expected to experience steady growth over the next twelve to eighteen
months. 

Merger
Valuation 

The
Company utilized the following process to determine the fair market value of 18,975,000 for the acquisition of all of Polomar Specialty
Pharmacy s intellectual property, intangible assets and plant and equipment. 

We
utilized a three-step process to determine the fair value of Synergistic Equity Value of the Company: 

1.
we determined the aggregate equity value of Polomar. After due consideration of all appropriate and generally accepted valuation methodologies,
our analysis has been developed primarily on the basis of: (i) the market approach, specifically the guideline public company method;
and (ii) the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. 

2.
we determined the aggregate equity value of Trustfeed. After due consideration of all appropriate and generally accepted valuation methodologies,
our analysis has been developed primarily on the basis of: (i) the asset-based approach, specifically the adjusted book value method. 

3.
we added the fair value of equity of Trustfeed and Polomar arrive at the Fair Value of Synergistic Equity Value of the Company. 

We
used a two-step process to determine the fair value of the Transaction Consideration: 

1.
we divided the fair value of Synergistic Equity Value of the Company by Trustfeed s postclosing shares outstanding to arrive at
the per share equity value of the Company. 

2.
we multiplied the per share equity value by the number of shares owned by current Company shareholders to arrive at the fair value of
Transaction Consideration. 

License

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

The
Company had revenues of 9,849 and 37,954 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to revenues of 21,457 and
 24,556 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues over the previous accounting periods was primarily
due to the Company s fulfillment of medical prescriptions. 

6 

Operating
expenses, which consisted mainly of general and administrative expenses, increased to 280,197 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, from 154,061 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an approximately 82 increase, and to 644,377 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, from 368,781 for the same period ended September 30, 2023, an approximately 75 increase from the period ended
September 30, 2023. 

Our
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted mainly of legal and accounting fees associated with our SEC
filings of 115,497 and payroll of 220,957. In comparison, our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted
mainly of programming fees of 82.945 and consulting fees of 58,739. 

Net
Loss 

We
recorded a net loss of 271,333 and 622,544 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared with a
net loss of 172,163 and 383,780 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, in all cases as a result of the
expenses incurred and insufficient revenues generated during the respective periods, as described further above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

To
date, we have has not generated material revenues from operations. We have incurred losses since inception and negative cash flows from
operating activities for all periods presented. As of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of 156,105 and total
current liabilities of 953,763. We had working capital of 797,658) as of September 30, 2024, as compared with 90,187) as of December
31, 2023. 

We
currently do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next 12 months and we require additional working capital for ongoing
operating expenses, which has been funded during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, by related party loans. We anticipate
adding consultants or employees for the corresponding operations of the Company, but this will not occur prior to obtaining additional
capital. 

Management
is currently in the process of looking for additional investors. Currently, loans from banks or other traditional lending sources for
lines of credit or similar short-term borrowings are not available to us. We have been able to raise working capital to fund operations
through related party debt or through the issuance of our restricted common stock. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 

Management
evaluated all relevant conditions and events that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated
financial statements are issued and determined that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to generate revenues
and raise capital. The Company has not generated revenues to provide sufficient cash flows to enable the Company to finance its operations
internally. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 16,202 cash on hand and had
an accumulated deficit of 2,192,373. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 622,544 and cash used
in operations of 704,792. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year from the date of filing. 

Over
the next twelve months management plans to raise additional capital and to invest its working capital resources in its existing business
and other potential business opportunities. However, there is no guarantee the Company will raise sufficient capital to continue operations.
The condensed unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. 

7 

Cash
Flows 

Net
cash used in operating activities was (704,792) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with (314,191) net cash used
in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the net cash used in operating activities was due
primarily to increased staffing and facility expenses 

Net
cash used in investing activities was (90,893) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with (132,000) net cash used
in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net cash used in investing activities was due
to mainly to fewer purchases of durable equipment. 

Financing activities provided 803,079 in cash for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, as compared with 257,118 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our financing cash flow for 2024 consisted
mainly of proceeds from related party debt and for 2023 it consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock.

Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2023. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CODE
OF ETHICS 

Polomar
Health Services, Inc. Polomar will conduct its business honestly and ethically wherever we operate in the world. We will
constantly improve the quality of our services, products and operations and will create a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect,
responsibility, integrity, trust and sound business judgment. No illegal or unethical conduct on the part of officers, directors, employees
or affiliates is in the company s best interest. 

Polomar
will not compromise its principles for short-term advantage. The ethical performance of this company is the sum of the ethics of the
employees who work here. Thus, we are all expected to adhere to high standards of personal integrity. Officers, directors, and employees
of the company must never permit their personal interests to conflict, or appear to conflict, with the interests of the company, its
clients or affiliates. They must be particularly careful to avoid representing Polomar in any transaction with others with whom there
is any outside business affiliation or 

 relationship.
They shall avoid using their company contacts to advance their private business or personal interests at the expense of the company,
its clients or affiliates. 

No
bribes, kickbacks or other similar remuneration or consideration shall be given to any person or organization in order to attract or
influence business activity. Officers, directors and employees shall avoid gifts, gratuities, fees, bonuses or excessive entertainment,
in order to attract or influence business activity. 

Officers,
directors and employees of Polomar will often come into contact with, or have possession of, 

 proprietary,
confidential or business-sensitive information and must take appropriate steps to assure that such information is strictly safeguarded.
This information whether it s on behalf of our company or any of our clients or affiliates could include strategic
business plans, operating results, marketing strategies, customer lists, personnel records, upcoming acquisitions and divestitures, new
investments, and manufacturing costs, processes and methods. 

Proprietary,
confidential and sensitive business information about this company, other companies, individuals and entities should be treated with
sensitivity and discretion and only be disseminated on a need-to-know basis. 

Misuse
of material inside information in connection with trading in the company s securities can expose an individual to civil liability
and penalties. 

Directors,
officers, and employees in possession of material information not available to 

 the
public are insiders. Spouses, friends, suppliers, brokers, and others outside the company who may have acquired the information
directly or indirectly from a director, officer or employee are also insiders. This prohibits insiders from trading in,
or recommending the sale or purchase of, the company s securities, while such inside information is regarded as material ,
or if it s important enough to influence you or any other person in the purchase or sale of securities of any company with which
we do business, which could be affected by the insider information. 

The
following guidelines should be followed in dealing with inside information: 

Until
the material information has been publicly released by the company, an employee must not disclose it to anyone except those within the
company whose positions require use of the information. 

Employees
must not buy or sell the company s securities when they have knowledge of material information concerning the company until it
has been disclosed to the public and the public has had sufficient time to absorb the information. 

Officers,
directors, and employees will seek to report all information accurately and honestly, and as otherwise required by applicable reporting
requirements. 

Officers,
directors, and employees will refrain from gathering competitor intelligence by illegitimate means and refrain from acting on knowledge
which has been gathered in such a manner. The officers, directors, and employees of Polomar will seek to avoid exaggerating or disparaging
comparisons of the services and competence of their competitors. 

Officers,
directors, and employees will obey all Equal Employment Opportunity laws and act with respect and responsibility towards others in all
of their dealings. 

Officers,
directors, and employees agree to disclose unethical, dishonest, fraudulent, and illegal behavior, or the violation of company policies
and procedures, directly to management. 

Violation
of this Code of Ethics can result in discipline, including possible termination. The degree of discipline relates in part to whether
there was a voluntary disclosure of any ethical violation and whether or not the violator cooperated in any subsequent investigation.
