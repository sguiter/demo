limited partnership formed to acquire producing and non-producing oil and natural gas properties onshore in the United States and to develop those properties. The initial capitalization of the Partnership of occurred on December 30, 2016. The Partnership completed its best-efforts offering in October 2019 with a total of approximately million common units sold for gross proceeds of million and proceeds net of offering costs of million. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership owned an approximate non-operated working interest in producing wells, predominantly in McKenzie, Dunn, McLean and Mountrail counties of North Dakota (collectively, the Bakken Assets ). The Partnership also owns an estimated approximate non-operated working interest in wells in various stages of the drilling and completion process, and possible future development locations in the Bakken Assets. The Bakken Assets, which are a part of the Bakken shale formation in the Greater Williston Basin, are operated by third-party operators on behalf of the Partnership and other working interest owners. 

The general partner of the Partnership is Energy Resources 12 GP, LLC (the General Partner ). The General Partner manages and controls the business affairs of the Partnership.

On August 31, 2018, the Partnership completed its second purchase of an additional non-operated working interest in the Bakken Assets for approximately million, including all closing costs and assumed liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership s ownership of the Bakken Assets consisted of an approximate non-operated working interest in producing wells, and an estimated approximate non-operated working interest in wells in various stages of the drilling and completion process. 

From September 1, 2017, the effective date of Acquisition No. 1, to September 30, 2024, the Partnership has participated in the drilling of wells, of which have been completed as of September 30, 2024. The Partnership incurred approximately million and million in capital drilling and completion costs for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Partnership anticipates less than million of capital expenditures will be incurred to complete the 4 wells in process as of September 30, 2024. Estimated capital expenditures to complete these 4 wells could be significantly different from amounts actually invested, and the timing of these expenditures is difficult to estimate.

In addition, the Partnership is not required to maintain a risk management program to manage the commodity price risk of the Partnership s future oil and gas production. However, if the Partnership does elect to speculatively trade and hedge future oil and natural gas production, hedged volumes may not exceed 85 of the Partnership s anticipated future production. 

The Credit Facility contains prepayment requirements, customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Certain of the financial covenants include: 

A minimum ratio of trailing 12-month EBITDAX to debt service coverage of 1.20 to 1.0 

A minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.00 to 1.00 

At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on the BF Credit Facility was approximately million, and the interest rate was . The Partnership was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility approximated the fair market value of the Credit Facility.

Upon closing of the minimum offering, the organizational limited partner withdrew its initial capital contribution of , the General Partner received Incentive Distribution Rights (defined below), and has been reimbursed for its documented third-party out-of-pocket expenses incurred in organizing the Partnership and offering the common units. 

The Partnership completed its best-efforts offering of common units as of the close of business on October 24, 2019. As of the conclusion of the offering, the Partnership had completed the sale of approximately million common units for total gross proceeds of million and proceeds net of offering costs of million.

The Managing Dealer also has Dealer Manager Incentive Fees (defined below) where the Managing Dealer could receive distributions up to an additional of gross proceeds of the common units sold in the Partnership s best-efforts offering as outlined in the prospectus based on the performance of the Partnership. Based on the common units sold in the best-efforts offering, the Dealer Manager Incentive Fees are approximately million, subject to Payout (defined below). 

Prior to Payout, which is defined below, all of the distributions made by the Partnership, if any, will be paid to the holders of common units. Accordingly, the Partnership will not make any distributions with respect to the Incentive Distribution Rights or the Dealer Manager Incentive Fees to the Managing Dealer until Payout occurs. 

The Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the Partnership Agreement provides that Payout , which is defined below, occurs on the day when the aggregate amount distributed with respect to each of the common units equals 20.00 plus the Payout Accrual. The Partnership Agreement defines Payout Accrual as 7 per annum simple interest accrued monthly until paid on the Net Investment Amount outstanding from time to time. The Partnership Agreement defines Net Investment Amount initially as 20.00 per common unit, regardless of the amount paid for the common unit. If at any time the Partnership distributes to holders of common units more than the Payout Accrual, the amount the Partnership distributes in excess of the Payout Accrual will reduce the Net Investment Amount.

These withholding tax payments, along with the 1.60 per common unit special distribution to holders of its common units in June 2023, have reduced the Net Investment Amount described above by an approximate total of per common unit.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Certain statements within this report may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are those that do not relate solely to historical fact. They include, but are not limited to, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance, achievements or events. You can identify these statements by the use of words such as may, will, could, anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, predict, continue, further, seek, plan or project and variations of these words or comparable words or phrases of similar meaning. 

These forward-looking statements include such things as: 

any impact of the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian and Middle Eastern conflicts on the global energy markets; 

references to future success in the Partnership s drilling and marketing activities; 

the Partnership s business strategy; 

estimated future distributions; 

estimated future capital expenditures; 

sales of the Partnership s properties and other liquidity events; 

competitive strengths and goals; and 

other similar matters. 

These forward-looking statements reflect the Partnership s current beliefs and expectations with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors outside the Partnership s control that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those described under Risk Factors in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the following: 

that the Partnership s development of its properties may not be successful or that its operations on such properties may not be successful; 

general economic, market, or business conditions; 

changes in laws or regulations; 

the risk that the wells in which the Partnership acquired an interest are productive, but do not produce enough revenue to return the investment made; 

the risk that the wells the Partnership drills do not find hydrocarbons in commercial quantities or, even if commercial quantities are encountered, that actual production is lower than expected on the productive life of wells is shorter than expected; 

current credit market conditions and the Partnership s ability to obtain long-term financing or refinancing debt for the Partnership s drilling and acquisition activities in a timely manner and on terms that are consistent with what the Partnership projects; 

uncertainties concerning the price of oil and natural gas, which may decrease and remain low for prolonged periods; and 

the risk that any hedging policy the Partnership employs to reduce the effects of changes in the prices of the Partnership s production will not be effective. 

Although the Partnership believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, the Partnership cannot assure investors that its expectations will be attained or that any deviations will not be material. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and that, except as required by law, the Partnership undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Partnership or to individuals acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this section. 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Partnership s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the information contained in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Overview 

Energy Resources 12, L.P. (the Partnership was formed as a Delaware limited partnership. The initial capitalization of the Partnership of 1,000 occurred on December 30, 2016. The Partnership began offering common units of limited partner interest (the common units on a best-efforts basis on May 17, 2017, the date the Partnership s initial Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-216891) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Partnership completed its best-efforts offering on October 24, 2019. Total common units sold were approximately 11.0 million for gross proceeds of 218.0 million and proceeds net of offering costs of 204.3 million. 

The general partner is Energy Resources 12 GP, LLC (the General Partner ). The General Partner manages the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership. All decisions regarding the management of the Partnership made by the General Partner are made by the Board of Directors of the General Partner and its officers. The Partnership has no officers, directors or employees. 

The Partnership was formed to acquire primarily oil and gas properties located onshore in the United States. On February 1, 2018, the Partnership completed its first asset purchase in the Williston Basin of North Dakota, acquiring, at closing, non-operated working interests in producing wells and in-process wells, along with additional future development locations, predominantly in McKenzie, Dunn, McLean and Mountrail counties of North Dakota (collectively, the Bakken Assets ), for approximately 90.5 million. On August 31, 2018, the Partnership closed on its second asset purchase, acquiring an additional non-operated working interest in the Bakken Assets for approximately 81.3 million. Prior to these acquisitions, the Partnership owned no oil and natural gas assets. The Partnership utilized proceeds from its best-efforts offering and available financing to close on the acquisitions. 

As a result of these acquisitions and completed drilling during the period of ownership, as of September 30, 2024, the Partnership s ownership of the Bakken Assets consisted of an approximate 5 non-operated working interest in 445 producing wells, an estimated 1 non-operated working interest in 4 wells in various stages of the drilling and completion process and additional possible future development locations. 

The Bakken Assets are operated by 13 third-party operators, including Devon Energy Corporation, Marathon Oil, EOG Resources, Continental Resources and Chord Energy. 

Current Price Environment 

Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids NGL prices are determined by many factors outside of the Partnership s control. Historically, world-wide oil and natural gas prices and markets have been subject to significant change and may continue to be in the future. Global macroeconomic factors contributing to uncertainty within the industry include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil-producing regions of the world, particularly Russia and the Middle East; forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with forecasted global supply; supply levels of oil and natural gas due to exploration and development activities in the United States; environmental and climate change regulation; actions taken by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. 

The length and outcome of the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia as well as the continued unrest in the Middle East are highly unpredictable, and further escalation of these conflicts could lead to significant market and other disruptions, such as volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability and other material and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions. The short- and long-term impact of these conflicts on the operations and financial condition of the Partnership and the global economy is uncertain.

Index 

The Partnership s oil and natural gas revenues are heavily weighted to oil, so any material change to market pricing for oil has a more significant impact to the Partnership s operational performance. If commodity prices significantly drop and remain low, the Partnership will see a reduction in available capital for the development of its undrilled wellsites. Future growth is dependent on the Partnership s ability to add reserves in excess of production. In addition to commodity price fluctuations, the Partnership faces the challenge of natural production volume declines. As reservoirs are depleted, oil and natural gas production from Partnership wells will decrease. 

Results of Operations 

In evaluating financial condition and operating performance, the most important indicators on which the Partnership focuses are (1) total quarterly production in barrel of oil equivalent BOE units, (2) average sales price per unit for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids NGL or NGLs ), (3) production costs per BOE and (4) capital expenditures. 

The following table is a summary of the results from operations, including production, of the Partnership s non-operated working interest in the Bakken Assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues for oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 10.2 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 9.0 million, which resulted in a realized price of 74.70 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 0.3 million, which resulted in a realized price of 1.13 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were approximately 0.9 million, which resulted in a realized price of 20.07 per BOE of production. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, revenues for oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 12.2 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 10.7 million, which resulted in a realized price of 81.64 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 0.7 million, which resulted in a realized price of 2.15 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were approximately 0.8 million, which resulted in a realized price of 18.60 per BOE of production.

Index 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues for oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 28.0 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 24.3 million, which resulted in a realized price of 76.10 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 1.1 million, which resulted in a realized price of 1.35 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were approximately 2.6 million, which resulted in a realized price of 21.36 per BOE of production. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenues for oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 38.3 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 33.4 million, which resulted in a realized price of 77.05 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 2.2 million, which resulted in a realized price of 2.65 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were approximately 2.7 million, which resulted in a realized price of 21.12 per BOE of production. 

The Partnership s operating results have been positively impacted by 20 new wells being turned to production during the second and third quarters of 2024. These wells boosted sold production to approximately 2,300 BOE per day for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of over 20 from the second quarter of 2024. Sold production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2,100 BOE per day. The completion of these wells during the summer of 2024 has helped to offset the ongoing impacts of adverse weather conditions in North Dakota during a multi-day stretch in mid-January that has led to suspended production throughout the Bakken during 2024. The Partnership s results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were also positively impacted by the completion of 27 new wells that were turned to sales during the fourth quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023. Sold production for the Bakken Assets was approximately 2,400 BOE per day and 2,600 BOE per day for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

In conjunction with commodity market pricing, the Partnership s results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by lower market commodity prices as well as reduced realized sales prices for oil (see Differentials below), when compared to the same periods of 2023. In addition, continued high inventories have kept natural gas prices low throughout 2024. 

If the operators of the Bakken Assets are unable to produce, process and sell oil and natural gas at economical prices, the operators may curtail daily production, shut-in producing wells or seek other cost-cutting measures. Consequently, any of these measures could significantly impact the Partnership s oil, natural gas and NGL production, and there can be no assurance regarding how they will produce if and when they are brought back on-line. Further, production is dependent on the investment in existing wells and the development of new wells. See further discussion on the Partnership s investment in new wells in Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 

Differentials 

The realized prices per barrel of oil above are based upon the NYMEX benchmark price less a cost to distribute the oil, or the differential. Oil price differentials primarily represent the transportation costs in moving produced oil at the wellhead to a refinery and are based on the availability of pipeline, rail and other transportation methods out of the Bakken. Oil price differentials to the NYMEX benchmark price vary by operator based upon operator-specific contracts. On average, the Partnership s realized oil price differentials were approximately 1 per barrel of oil higher during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the same periods of 2023, which reduced the Partnership s realized oil sales prices. 

The Dakota Access Pipeline is a significant pipeline that transports oil and natural gas from North Dakota fields. Its use by operators in the region is currently in ongoing litigation. If use of the Dakota Access Pipeline or any other pipelines servicing the region are suspended at a future date, the disruption of transporting the Partnership s production out of North Dakota could negatively impact the Partnership s realized sales prices, results of operations and/or cash flows. 

Operating costs and expenses 

Production expenses 

Production expenses are daily costs incurred by the Partnership to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to market, along with the daily costs incurred to maintain producing properties. Such costs include field personnel compensation, saltwater disposal, utilities, maintenance, repairs and servicing expenses related to the Partnership s oil and natural gas properties, along with the gathering and processing contracts in effect for the extraction, transportation and treatment of oil and natural gas. 

Production expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.5 million and 5.4 million, and production expenses per BOE were 20.81 and 23.94, respectively. Production expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 13.6 million and 15.7 million, and production expenses per BOE were 23.59 and 22.49, respectively. 

The Partnership s lease operating expenses have been lower during 2024, and due to lower sold production of natural gas and NGLs, compared to 2023, marketing and selling costs have also decreased in 2024. Lower expenses coupled with improved sold production volumes from recently-completed wells resulted in lower production expenses per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024. However, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, production expenses per BOE increased, in comparison to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher year-to-date workover expenses and overall lower sold production volumes, which decreases the production base over which fixed costs are spread. 

16

Index 

Production taxes 

Taxes on the production and extraction of oil and gas are regulated and set by North Dakota tax authorities. Taxes on the sale of gas and NGL products are less than taxes levied on the sale of oil. Therefore, production taxes as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate dependent upon the ratio of sales of natural gas and NGLs to total sales. Production taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.7 million (7 of revenue) and 1.1 million (9 of revenue), respectively. Production taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.3 million (8 of revenue) and 3.2 million (9 of revenue), respectively. Oil production comprised approximately 56 of the Partnership s sold production volumes in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 57 and 62 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

General and administrative expenses 

The principal components of general and administrative expense are accounting, legal, advisory and consulting fees. General and administrative costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.5 million in both periods. General and administrative costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.7 million in both periods. 

Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion DD A 

DD A of capitalized drilling and development costs of producing oil, natural gas and NGL properties are computed using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Costs of acquiring proved properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves. The Partnership s DD A for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.2 million and 4.6 million, respectively, and DD A per BOE of production was 24.27 and 20.13, respectively. The Partnership s DD A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 13.7 million in both periods, and DD A per BOE of production was 23.80 and 19.58, respectively. 

The increase in DD A expense per BOE of production for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to same periods of 2023, is primarily due to a reduction of the Partnership s estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves resulting from well performance during 2023 and 2024 during the Partnership s December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024 reserve analyses. 

Interest income (expense), net 

Interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 105,000 and 141,000. Interest income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 22,000 and 247,000. The primary component of interest expense in 2024 was interest expense on the Partnership s Credit Facility. 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measure 

The Partnership uses Adjusted EBITDAX , defined as earnings (loss) before (i) interest income (expense), net; (ii) income taxes; (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion; and (iv) exploration expenses, as a key supplemental measure of its operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Partnership s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although Adjusted EBITDAX, as calculated by the Partnership, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDAX as reported by other companies that do not define such term exactly as the Partnership defines such term, the Partnership believes this supplemental measure is useful to investors when comparing the Partnership s results between periods and with other energy companies. 

The Partnership believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX is important to provide investors with additional information (i) to provide an important supplemental indicator of the operational performance of the Partnership s business without regard to financing methods and capital structure, and (ii) to measure the operational performance of the Partnership s operators.

Transactions with Related Parties 

The Partnership has, and is expected to continue to engage in, significant transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm s length and the results of the Partnership s operations may be different than if conducted with non-related parties. The General Partner s Board of Directors oversees and reviews the Partnership s related party relationships and is required to approve any significant modifications to existing related party transactions, as well as any new significant related party transactions. 

See further discussion in Note 7. Related Parties in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Historically, the Partnership s principal sources of liquidity have been cash on-hand and the cash flow generated from the properties the Partnership owns. The Partnership generated approximately 8.0 million and 27.2 million in cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. In May 2024, the Partnership entered into a loan agreement with BancFirst that provides for a revolving credit facility for the Partnership to use for future development of oil and natural gas wells on its undrilled acreage in North Dakota. The initial borrowing base is 10 million (see more information in Subsequent Events below), and the Partnership has an outstanding balance of approximately 4.6 million at the time of filing of this Form 10-Q. 

The Partnership anticipates that cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, including completing the outstanding capital expenditures discussed below. 

Although the Partnership anticipates its sources of liquidity to be adequate to fund its cash requirements, if market prices for oil and natural gas decline and/or production from Partnership wells is not replenished through the completion of new well investments, the Partnership s cash flow from operations may decline. This could have a significant impact on the Partnership s available cash on-hand, the Partnership s ability to fund distributions to its limited partners and/or participate in future drilling programs as proposed by the operators of the Bakken Assets. 

Partners Equity 

The Partnership completed its best-efforts offering of common units on October 24, 2019. As of the conclusion of the offering, the Partnership had completed the sale of approximately 11.0 million common units for total gross proceeds of 218.0 million and proceeds net of offering costs of 204.3 million. 

Under the agreement with the Managing Dealer, the Managing Dealer received a total of 6 in selling commissions and a marketing expense allowance based on gross proceeds of the common units sold. The Managing Dealer also has Dealer Manager Incentive Fees (defined below) where the Managing Dealer could receive distributions up to an additional 4 of gross proceeds of the common units sold in the Partnership s best-efforts offering as outlined in the prospectus based on the performance of the Partnership. Based on the common units sold through the conclusion of the offering, the Dealer Manager Incentive Fees are approximately 8.7 million, subject to Payout (as defined in Note 6. Capital Contribution and Partners Equity in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). 

18

Index 

Distributions 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership paid distributions of 0.320541 and 0.961623 per common unit, or 3.5 million and 10.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Partnership paid distributions of 0.320541 and 2.618623 per common unit, or 3.5 million and 28.9 million, respectively. 

The Partnership is permitted to make distributions to its limited partners so long as the Partnership is in compliance with its debt service coverage ratio and no other event of default has occurred. While the Partnership s goal is to maintain a relatively stable distribution rate over the life of its program, the General Partner monitors monthly Partnership distributions in conjunction with the Partnership s projected cash requirements for operations, payments on its credit facility and capital expenditures for new wells. There can be no assurance as to the classification or duration of distributions at the current distribution rate. If distributions are not paid or are reduced, the difference to the current distribution rate per common unit will be deferred and is required to be paid before final Payout occurs. 

Oil and Natural Gas Properties 

The Partnership incurred approximately 2.5 million and 9.1 million in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Partnership has 4 wells in various stages of the drilling and completion process, and the Partnership estimates its share of capital expenditures to finish these wells is less than 1 million. The Partnership anticipates the 4 wells in process will be substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition to the estimated capital expenditures to fully fund the recently completed and in-process wells, the Partnership anticipates that it may be obligated to invest up to an additional 20 to 35 million in drilling capital expenditures from 2024 through 2028 to participate in new well development in the Bakken Assets without becoming subject to non-consent penalties under the joint operating agreements or North Dakota statutes governing the Bakken Assets. 

Since the Partnership is not the operator of any of its oil and natural gas properties, it is difficult to predict levels of future participation in the drilling and completion of new wells, the timing of such activities and their associated capital expenditures. This makes capital expenditures for drilling and completion projects difficult to forecast for the remainder of 2024 and 2025. Current estimated capital expenditures could be significantly different from amounts actually invested. 

The Partnership expects to fund overhead costs and capital additions related to the drilling and completion of wells primarily from cash on hand, cash generated by its producing wells and/or availability under its revolving credit facility. If an operator elects to complete drilling or other significant capital expenditure activity and the Partnership is unable to fund the capital expenditures, the General Partner may decide to farmout the well. Also, if a well is proposed under the operating agreement for one of the properties the Partnership owns, the General Partner may elect to non-consent the well. Non-consenting a well will generally cause the Partnership not to be obligated to pay the costs of the well, but the Partnership will not be entitled to the proceeds of production from the well and would be subject to a non-consent penalty. 

Subsequent Events 

In October 2024, the Partnership declared and paid 1.1 million, or 0.098628 per outstanding common unit, in distributions to its holders of common units.
