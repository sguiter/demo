Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. Overview Currently, WEED and its subsidiaries are working on or planning for several different business opportunities in the cannabis hemp field, including, but not limited to: both indoor and outdoor grows , cultivations harvest for research, product development, processing and manufacturing of both Pharma non-Pharma products, services, therapeutics, and treatments on a global basis for both the Medical Cannabis Hemp Second, on November 22, 2021, WEED completed the purchase of the Sugar Hill Golf course property located in the town of Portland, New York. WEED s acquisition of this ~43 acre property with ~2000 ft. of Lake Erie waterfront also comes with the unlimited water extractions rights from Lake Erie related to the property, along with a complete wastewater management plant. WEED s initial plan is to utilize the property to access the hemp and infused beverage markets as our property in the middle of the largest concord grape producing region of the United States. In the future, WEED may look to use the unique property infrastructure to build a luxury condos resort development in the most natural settings to be ESG compliant in conjunction to WEEDs forming its Social Equity Advisory Council (SEAC) to create Diversity Equality in our industry. This project is only in its conceptual stage, no funding or plans have been developed other than the proposed name: The Four Winds Luxury condos resort to be Cannabis Friendly which would be a FIRST in the nation. The New York property is now owned by Four Winds of Lake Erie, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WEED, Inc. Third, WEED established WEED Australia Ltd. and it s wholly owned Cannabis Institute of Australia (C.I.A.) in Australia in March of 2017, for the purpose of conducting cannabis and hemp research and potentially developing products and educational services in and for Australians as stated above. C.I.A. is a non-profit entity formed for the purpose of conducting cannabis and hemp research with universities and other non-profits to protect all intellectual rights, properties and usage in our highly regulated industry. The C.I.A. has the potential to develop products in Australia for domestic research and development of products, services and educational purposes to all seven States and territories, including Tasmania, to be marketed globally. WEED Australia is also our gateway to the Oceania Asia emerging legal cannabis marketplace. Fourth, on May 2, 2022, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with Hempirical Genetics, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company Hempirical ), under which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Hempirical from Jeffery Miller in exchange for 603,284 payable in Two Million (2,000,000) shares of our common stock (the WEED Shares ), valued at 394,302 based on the value of our common stock, and 250,000 in cash to be paid over four years. With this acquisition, our newly acquired inventory includes over 200 High THC strains plus 15 PURE Landrace strains including Panama Red, Acapulco Gold, Red Bud Colombian, Santa Marta Gold, and ThaiSticks. Along with 30+ CBD CBG strains. WEED believes that multiple combinations of precise cannabinoid strains will achieve the precise medical outcome desired. 20 Table of Contents Our first business opportunity was, and continues to be, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sangre AT, LLC Sangre ), where we are focused on the development and application of cannabis-derived compounds for the treatment of human disease and animal ailments. To that end Sangre, was working on a planned five-year Cannabis Genomic Study to complete a genetic blueprint of the Cannabis plant genus, by creating a global genomic classification of the entire plant. Sangre completed a 1-2 year Pilot Study in 2017 2018 at the University of Texas-Galveston thru Industrial Metagenomics at a cost of nearly 1 million USD. Sangre completed the pilot study with 30 cultivars from strains collected worldwide that included 30 strains (twenty-four female and six male). These results are highly proprietary and the basis of future studies to come. We need to raise additional funds to continue the next steps in our Cannabis Genomic Study. On May 14th, 2018, the 70th Anniversary of the statehood of Israel, WEED formed its wholly owned subsidiary, WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., with the goal of completing and adding to the noted studies above. As such, WEED Israel worked with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and with the top scientists globally in the field of Cannabis hemp. To that effect, WEED Israel looked to conduct clinical trials and product development that would be the quality and acceptability of the FDA in the United States. Due to current laws and conditions in the USA, all research results and product development for both Pharma Non-Pharma products, cannot be introduced the United States marketplace. Since starting in 2018, the USA has made vast improvements and advancements in the legalization of both Cannabis and hemp. As of the end of 2021 there are 37 States that have approved a State level medical cannabis and hemp programs, along with the District of Colombia. In addition, there are 17 States that have implemented or approved the Adult Use i.e. recreational psychoactive aspects of high THC usage of cannabis. In conjunction with WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., we made arrangements with Professor Elka Touitou to be available to be the head of WEEDs Israeli Advisory Board to lead and assist us with clinical trials in cannabis hemp research studies in Israel. Professor Touitou was the Head of the Innovative Dermal, Transdermal and Transmucosal Delivery Lab at the Institute of Drug Research, The School of Pharmacy, HUJ, now retired but still has HUJ clinical trial independent studies/lab privileges. Professor Touitou is an internationally renowned authority in the field of drug delivery and design of new technologies for efficient administration of drugs and development of new products. Professor Touitou has been involved in Cannabinoid research since 1988 at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, (HUJ) Jerusalem, Israel. Previously, WEED was in the process of buying Professor Touitou s various patents to include the bioavailability aspects of the cannabaceae plant. However, after expending over 500,000 USD to acquire the Professor Touitou s patents, we had to terminate the agreement in 2019 due to the downturn of the Cannabis marketplace, and specifically as to public cannabis companies, which could not be resumed due to the Covid pandemic that was/is still ongoing globally. We have kept in constant contact with Professor Touitou thru our Managing Director of WEED Israel, Mr. Elliot Kwestel. As of 2022, Dr. Touitou still has interest in working with WEED to complete the purchase of her patents and begin clinical trials upon proper funding. WEED looks to achieve that funding thru offerings of our securities. Corporate Overview We were originally incorporated under the name Plae, Inc., in the State of Arizona on August 20, 1999. At the time we operated under the name Plae, Inc., no business was conducted. No books or records were maintained and no meetings were held. In essence, nothing was done after incorporation until Glenn E. Martin took possession of Plae, Inc. in January 2005. On February 18, 2005, the corporate name was changed to King Mines, Inc. and then subsequently changed to its current name, United Mines, Inc., on March 30, 2005. No shares were issued until the Company became United Mines, Inc. From 2005 until 2015, we were an exploration stage mineral exploration company that owned a number of unpatented mining claims and Arizona State Land Department claims. 21 Table of Contents On November 26, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the redomestication of our company from Arizona to Nevada (the Articles of Domestication ), and approved Articles of Incorporation in Nevada, which differed from then-Articles of Incorporation in Arizona, primarily by (a) changing our name from United Mines, Inc. to WEED, Inc., (b) authorizing Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of preferred stock, with blank check rights granted to our Board of Directors, and (c) authorizing Two Hundred Million (200,000,000) shares of common stock (the Nevada Articles of Incorporation ). On December 19, 2014, the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock approved the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation at a Special Meeting of Shareholders. On January 16, 2015, the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation went effective with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On February 2, 2015, our name change to WEED, Inc., and a corresponding ticker symbol change to BUDZ went effective with FINRA and was reflected on the quotation of our common stock on OTC Markets. These changes were affected in order to make our corporate name and ticker symbol better align with our short-term and long-term business focus. Our current, short-term goals relate to the Cannabis Genomic Study and the resulting development of a variety of new cannabis strains, and, over the next 5 years, we plan to process those results in order to become an international cannabis research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brand focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade Cultivation Centers to consult, assist, manage lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis with a concentration on the legal and medical cannabis sector. Our long-term plan is to become a true Seed-to-Sale global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development, and real estate options in this new emerging market. Our long term growth may also come from the acquisition of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries, to make anything from infused beverages to super oxygenated water with CBD and THC. Currently, we have formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia to address this Global demand. We have also formed WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., an Israeli corporation, to address future global demand. We will look to conduct future research, marketing, import/exporting, and manufacturing of our proprietary products on an international level. On April 20, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Sangre AT, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, under which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership units of Sangre in exchange for Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144. As a result of this agreement, Sangre is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WEED, Inc. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included as part of this Quarterly Report. 22 Table of Contents Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Revenue - - Cost of goods sold - - Gross Profit - - Operating expenses: General and administrative 64,833 25,355 Professional fees 22,195 205,134 Depreciation and amortization 5,621 8,335 Total operating expenses 92,649 238,824 Net operating loss (92,649 (238,824 Other income (expense) Interest expense (3,238 (15,303 Gain on disposal of fixed assets - 988,375 Total other income (expense) (3,238 973,072 Income Tax Expense - - Net Income (Loss) (95,887 734,248 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (157 1,364 Comprehensive Income (Loss) (96,044 735,612 Operating Loss; Net Income Our net income decreased by 830,135, from 734,248to (95,887), from the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Our long-term plan is to become a True Seed-to-Sale company providing infrastructure, financial solutions and real estate options in this new emerging market, worldwide.

We expect these fees to vary quarter-to-quarter as our business and stock price fluctuate if we continue to use stock-based compensation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Introduction During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, because of our operating losses, we did not generate positive operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, was 5,311and our monthly cash flow burn rate was approximately 32,000. We currently do not believe we will be able to satisfy our cash needs from our revenues for many years to come. 25 Table of Contents Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, are as follows: June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Cash 5,311 290,409 (285,098 Total Current Assets 39,381 319,886 (280,505 Total Assets 596,818 904,062 (307,244 Total Current Liabilities 685,044 648,753 36,291 Total Liabilities 685,044 648,753 36,291 Our total assets decreased by 307,244 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in our total assets between the two periods was attributed to decreases in our property and equipment, intangible assets, ROU assets. Our current liabilities and total liabilities increased by 36,291, as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued interest, notes payable -related parties and partially offset by decreases in accrued officer compensation and lease liability. In order to pay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts. Cash Requirements We had cash available of 5,311and 290,409 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Based on our lack of revenues, our cash on hand and current monthly burn rate of approximately 32,000, we will need to continue borrowing from our shareholders and other related parties, and/or raise money from the sales of our securities, to fund operations. Sources and Uses of Cash Operations We had net cash used in operating activities of 279,154 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 734,202 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the period in 2024, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of 377,492, adjusted by depreciation and amortization of 16,964, debt discount amortization of 7,691, estimated fair value of shares issued for services of 14,000, estimated fair value of shares issued for services of 20,000, and imputed interest on RP loans of 900, and further adjusted by decreases in assets related to prepaid expenses and deposits of 4,592 and increases in liabilities consisting of accounts payable of 16,631and accrued expenses of 17,829. For the period in 2023, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net income of 363,790, adjusted by depreciation and amortization of 55,721, debt discount amortization of 4,292, estimated fair value of shares issued for services of 67,500, imputed interest on RP loans of 16,686, and further adjusted by decreases in prepaid expenses and deposits of (14,171) and accounts payable of (42,174), and decreases in accrued expenses of (197,471). Investments For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had no cash flows provided from investing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had cash flows used in investing activities of 1,631,073, primarily related to the proceeds from disposal of a fixed asset of 1,641,073, slightly offset by 10,000) related to purchases of property and equipment. Financing Our net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was (5,000). For the period in 2023, our financing activities related to proceeds of note payable of 50,000, offset by repayments of notes payable-related party of 622,979). 26 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements. ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure and control procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and chief financial officer (our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Additionally, in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable judgment. We also do not have an audit committee. Based on the evaluation described above, and as a result, in part, of not having an audit committee and having one individual serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to the same extent they were not effective as of December 31, 2023. In addition to the deficiencies previously reported, we do not have formal processes related to the identification and approval of related party transactions. As funds become available to us, we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures. (b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. (c) Officer s Certifications Appearing as an exhibit to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are Certifications of our Chief Executive and Financial Officer. The Certifications are required pursuant to Sections 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications ).

This information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 27 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time involved in various pending or threatened legal actions.

However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein, matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
