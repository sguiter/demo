, in the State of Delaware and operates in Florida providing an on-demand
mobile gas delivery service. Its wholly owned subsidiary Neighborhood Fuel Holdings, LLC is inactive. 

NASDAQ
 Continued Listing Rule or Standard 

As
previously disclosed, on August 22, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that the Company s stockholders equity did not comply with
the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b) (the Equity
Rule ). Upon submission of the Company s plan to regain compliance, the Staff granted the Company an extension until February
20, 2024 to comply with this requirement. 

On
February 21, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter (the Delist Letter from the Staff advising the Company
that the Staff had determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension. Specifically, the Company did not complete its
proposed transaction to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and evidence compliance on or before February 20, 2024. See Form 8-K filed
on February 23, 2024. 

The
Company had requested an appeal for the Staff s determination. A hearing occurred on May 2, 2024. At the hearing, the Company presented
its plan for regaining compliance with the Equity Rule and may request a further extension to complete the execution of its plan. 

On
August 30, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq confirming that the Company has (i) regained compliance with the Equity Rule,
as required by the Panel s decision dated May 13, 2024, as amended, and (ii) in application of Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the
Company will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor for a period of one year from the date of such letter. If, within that one-year
monitoring period, the Staff finds that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Equity Rule, then, notwithstanding Listing Rule
5810(c)(2), the Company will not be permitted to provide Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to such deficiency and Staff will
not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with respect to such deficiency, nor will the Company
be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3). Instead, the Staff will issue a Delist Determination
Letter, and the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if
the initial Panel is unavailable. The Company will have the opportunity to respond/ present to the Hearings Panel as provided by Listing
Rule 5815(d)(4)(C) and the Company s securities may at that time be delisted from Nasdaq. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for interim financial statements U.S. GAAP and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain
all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial
statements. 

In
the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all of the adjustments
necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and
the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. 

These
unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Management
acknowledges its responsibility for the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements which reflect all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement of its consolidated
financial position and the consolidated results of its operations for the periods presented. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had: 

Net
 loss available to common stockholders of ; and 

Net
 cash used in operations was 

Additionally,
at September 30, 2024, the Company had: 

Accumulated
 deficit of 

Stockholders 
 equity of ; and 

Working
 capital deficit of 

The
Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital immediately in order to continue to fund its operations. The Company
has relied on related parties for the debt based funding of its operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain
funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable
the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations.

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER

The
Company s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital
and capital expenditures. The Company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many
factors, including the Company s ability to successfully expand to new markets, competition, and the need to enter into collaborations
with other companies or acquire other companies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings. 

There
can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms which are favorable, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional
funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it will be forced to delay, reduce, or cease its operations. 

We
manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had cash on hand
of at September 30, 2024. 

The
Company has historically incurred significant losses since inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues
from the sales of its products and services to achieve profitable operations. In making this assessment we performed a comprehensive
analysis of our current circumstances including: our financial position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2025, and our current capital structure including equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts. 

These
factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent
to the date that these financial statements are issued. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern
and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

Management s
strategic plans include the following: 

Expand
 into new and existing markets (commercial and residential); 

Obtain
 additional debt and/or equity based financing; 

Collaborations
 with other operating businesses for strategic opportunities; and 

Acquire
 other businesses to enhance or complement our current business model while accelerating our growth.

The
Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be accounted for as
a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value
of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the transaction
is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, further determination is required as to whether the Company has acquired inputs and
processes that can create outputs that would meet the definition of a business. When applying the screen test, significant judgment is
required to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets. 

Accounting
for asset acquisitions falls under the guidance of Topic 805, Business Combinations, specifically Subtopic 805-50. A cost accumulation
model is used to determine an asset acquisition s cost. Assets acquired are based on their cost, generally allocated to them on
a relative fair value basis. Direct acquisition-related costs are included in the cost of the acquired assets. 

The
distinction between business combinations and asset acquisitions involves judgment, particularly when applying the screen test to determine
the nature of the transaction. Incorrect judgments or changes in decisions in these areas could materially affect the determination of
goodwill, the recognition and measurement of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and, consequently, our financial position and results
of operations.

The
three tiers are defined as follows: 

Level
 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical
 assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 
 Level
 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable
 either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities;
 and 
 
 Level
 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require
 the Company to develop its own assumptions. 

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. 

The
Company may also engage external advisors to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. Although the Company believes that
the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value
or reflective of future fair values.

Certain
categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.
The Company looks to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation

Other
factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited
to:

 Projected
 future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates
 of commodity prices;

 Nature

 The
 sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors. 

Concluding
that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable,
such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company utilizes a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of its
cumulative results in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which we use in our financial performance analyses. This measure should not be considered a substitute
for GAAP-basis measures, nor should it be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe
that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net interest expense, taxes, depreciation,
amortization, and stock compensation expense, provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of
our financial results. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ
from ours for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA
assists investors who follow the practice of some investment analysts who adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude items that may obscure
underlying performance and distort comparability.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Cash
Flow Activities 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 828,185 in cash compared to approximately 226,985 at December 31, 2023. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 3,448,667 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was made up primarily by the net
loss of 13,339,363 and offset by non-cash adjustments for a net amount of 9,890,696. Net cash used in operating activities was 5,439,667
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was made up primarily by the net loss of 7,044,320 and offset by non-cash adjustments
for a net amount of 1,604,653. 

Investing
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net cash used by investing activities was 55,704. The cash used was to purchase equipment of
 38,554 and advances to related party of 17,150. Net cash provided by investing activities during the prior year was 2,130,116 resulting
from the proceeds as part of the sale of marketable debt securities, net of 19,498 in purchases of equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

We
generated 4,105,571 of cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including a 3,300,000
loan from a related party (an approximate 20 shareholder of the Company), proceeds from issuance of Series B convertible preferred
stock from a related party (an approximate 20 shareholder of the Company) of 1,400,000 and proceeds from notes payable of 250,000
less principal repayments of 844,429. We generated 1,628,490 of cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2023, including a 3,321,000 loan from a related party (an approximate 20 shareholder of the Company) and proceeds from notes payable
of 250,000, net of the repayments of loans payable from a related party of 262,500 and repayments of notes payable of 680,110 and
repayments on line of credit of 1,000,000, we also received 25,308 of proceeds for the issuance of stock from the ATM and recorded
related expenses of 25,308. 

Sources
of Capital 

The
Company has sustained net losses since inception and does not have sufficient revenues and income to fully fund its operations. As a
result, the Company has relied on equity and debt financings to fund its activities to date. For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company had a net loss of 13,339,363. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 58,741,247. The Company
anticipates that it will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations through the foreseeable future. 

5 

The
Company has limited capital and is currently relying on a related party to fund its operations. There is no assurance that the Company
will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company
might raise will enable the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations. The Company s operating needs
include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. The Company s
future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company s ability
to successfully expand to new markets, competition, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies
to enhance or complement its product and service offerings. There can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms which
are favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funding to meet our working capital needs in the future, we will
be forced to delay, reduce, or cease our operations. 

Going
Concern 

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had: 

Net
 loss available to common stockholders of 13,424,197; and 

Net
 cash used in operations was 3,448,667 

Additionally,
at September 30, 2024, the Company had: 

Accumulated
 deficit of 58,741,247 

Stockholders 
 equity of 3,558,365; and 

Working
capital of 1,302,925 

The
Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital immediately in order to continue to fund its operations. The Company
has relied on related parties for the debt based funding of its operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain
funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable
the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations. 

The
Company s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital
and capital expenditures. The Company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many
factors, including the Company s ability to successfully expand to new markets, competition, and the need to enter into collaborations
with other companies or acquire other companies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings. 

There
can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms which are favorable, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional
funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it will be forced to delay, reduce, or cease its operations. 

We
manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had cash on hand
of 828,185 at September 30, 2024. 

The
Company has historically incurred significant losses since inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues
from the sales of its products and services to achieve profitable operations. In making this assessment we performed a comprehensive
analysis of our current circumstances including: our financial position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2025, and our current capital structure including equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts. 

These
factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent
to the date that these financial statements are issued. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern
and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and
current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance,
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
