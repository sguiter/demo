Certain assets and liabilities are required to be
recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company adjusts derivative financial instruments to fair value on a recurring basis. The
fair value for other assets and liabilities such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accounts
payable and accrued expenses have been determined to approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The
Company believes that its indebtedness approximates fair value based on current yields for debt instruments with similar terms. 

To
achieve this core principle, five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer;
(2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance
obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. During the period ended
September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 ,
the Company did not recognize any revenue.

excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. 

at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company incurred net losses of . The Company had a working capital deficit of at September 30, 2024. 

 The Company s
ability to transition to profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure.
The timing and amount of actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth
of the Company s business and availability to sufficient resources. 

 At the filling date of this report, management
is working to conclude the sales in Germany and in other regions of the world relating to previously approved proposals, which would bring
a growing revenue. Management plans to expand sales operations by greater market penetration of the agricultural, industrial and community
development markets with the Company s innovative water and energy generation solutions. Management also plans to raise additional
funds during 2024 through the issuance of equity securities, from deposits related to customer purchase orders, and, if necessary, loans
from management and third-party lenders. Management also plans to reduce expenses by centralizing the Company s assembly, logistics
and administrative operations into a larger, self-sufficient, off-grid location that will be able to house the storage of supplies and
inventory, as well as provide space for assembly and administrative operations. The Company is also planning to acquire our its electric
vehicles to reduce its supply transportation costs. 

These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Derivative Liabilities 

 The Company issued
debt that consists of the issuance of convertible notes with variable conversion provisions as described above. The conversion terms of
the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors, such as the future price of the Company s common stock. The number
of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company s common stock. Accordingly, the number of shares
of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note is indeterminate. Due to the fact that the number of shares of common
stock issuable could exceed the Company s authorized share limit, the equity environment is tainted, and all additional convertible
debentures and warrants are included in the value of the derivative liabilities. Pursuant to ASC 815-15, Embedded Derivatives, 
the fair values of the variable convertible notes and shares to be issued were recorded as derivative liabilities on the issuance date
and revalued at each reporting period. 

 Based on the various convertible
notes described above, the fair value of applicable derivative liabilities on notes and change in fair value of derivative liability
are as follows as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

Change due to issuances

A
summary of quantitative information with respect to valuation methodology and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s
derivative liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023 is as follows: 

Exercise price 

Contractual term (in years) 

Volatility (annual) 

Risk-free rate 

The foregoing assumptions
are reviewed quarterly and are subject to change based primarily on management s assessment of the probability of the events described
occurring. Accordingly, changes to these assessments could materially affect the valuations.

 Overview 

 We are an engineering services company formed
as an outsourcing green tech platform focused on sustainable water and energy solutions. We are a United Nations accredited vendor 
and offer design, construction, maintenance and specialty consulting services to private companies, government entities, non-government
organizations and intergovernmental organizations for the sustainable supply of energy and water. 

 We build sustainable water and energy systems
out of existing, proven technologies, utilizing our intellectual property and our technical know-how to customize solutions to meet our
clients needs. Using our patent-pending design, we are working to design, build, and operate off-the-grid atmospheric water generation
systems in Mexico and the United States, as well as off-the-grid electric vehicle charging stations in Germany. 

 In order to effectively cater to our expanding
operations in Germany, we have strategically established a branch for business operations in Germany, along with two wholly owned German
subsidiaries: Energy and Water Development Deutschland GmbH and EAWD Logistik GmbH. Moreover, recognizing the importance of regional market
demands, we have also extended our presence to Mexico through a wholly owned subsidiary, EAWD Mexico SAPI de CV, enhancing our capacity
to address the needs of this area efficiently. This strategic positioning not only reflects our commitment to environmental progress but
also ensures an optimized response to evolving market requirements. 

 To date, we have not generated any revenues
from the sale of our sustainable water and energy solutions.

General
and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expenses decreased by 194,087
to 1,666,697 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,860,784 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The decrease in general and administrative expenses
was primarily due to a decrease in professional fee of 166,966, officers salaries and payroll taxes of 138,743, offset by an
increase in other general and administrative expenses of 128,463. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other expenses
increased by 499,614 to 1,033,478 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to other expense of 533,864 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in
other expense is the result of an increase in interest expense of 765,124 and change in fair value of derivative of 51,710, offset by
a decrease in loss on settlement of liabilities of 196,159 and an increase in other income of 121,061 . 

Net Loss 

 Net loss increased by 305,045 to 2,700,175 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,394,648 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was attributable to the
net increases and decreases as discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had 4,575 in
cash. Our operating and capital requirements in connection with supporting our operations will continue to be significant. Since inception,
our losses from operations and working capital requirements have been satisfied through the deferral of payment for services performed
by our founders and related parties. 

 We have sustained operating losses since we
began our operations in 2012. At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 30,471,466. We cannot predict how long we will
continue to incur further losses or whether we will ever become profitable as this is dependent upon the reduction of certain expenses
and success in obtaining project contracts, among other things. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustment with respect to
these uncertainties. 

24 

Our ability
to transition to profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. The timing
and amount of our actual expenditure will be based on many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business and availability to sufficient resources. 

 Management
is working to conclude the sales in Germany and in other regions of the world relating to previously approved proposals, which would bring
a growing revenue. Management plans to expand sales operations by greater market penetration of the agricultural, industrial and community
development markets with our innovative water and energy generation solutions. Management also plans to raise additional funds during
2024 through the issuance of equity securities, from deposits related to customer purchase orders, and, if necessary, loans from management
and third-party lenders. Management also plans to reduce expenses by centralizing our assembly, logistics and administrative operations
into a larger, self-sufficient, off-grid location that will be able to house the storage of supplies and inventory, as well as provide
space for assembly and administrative operations. We are also planning to acquire our own electric vehicles to reduce our supply transportation
costs. 

 The ability
of our company to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to generate sales or obtain additional funding to finance operating
losses until it is profitable. 

 Summary of Cash Flow 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

We
used 880,529 of
cash in our operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,553,442 used in the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in cash used of 672,913 is
primarily due to an increase in excess of debt discount and financing costs of 527,624 ,
offset by a decrease in loss on settlement of 196,159 and an increase in net loss of 305,045, as well as a decrease in cash used by
working capital items of 165,301 principally related to an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred taxes of 506,459. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

The Company generated 46,321 in cash from investing
activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of 31,781 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 943,729 and
 1,677,288 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net decrease of 733,559 is
primarily due to 831,600 of proceeds from common stock subscriptions and proceeds from sale of stock of 104,699, offset by an increase
in proceed from convertible notes of 228,550. 

Financial Position 

Total Assets As of September
30, 2024 the Company had 1,237,125 of total assets representing 4,575 in cash, 502,462 in inventory, 416,064 in prepaid expenses and
other current assets, 138,707 in property and equipment, and 175,317 in operating lease right-of-use asset. 

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 

We expect to generate more revenues which should,
grow in time and lead to a positive cash flow. In the near future, we expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded
through sales contracts, lines of credit, convertible loans and/or further issuances of other securities in sufficient quantities that
we will be able to meet our working capital requirement from these possible sources. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt
will result in dilution to our current shareholders. 

We seek to focus on three main aspects of the water
and energy business: (1) generation, (2) supply, and (3) maintenance. We seek to assist private companies, government entities and NGO s
to build profitable and sustainable supplies/generation capabilities of water and energy as required, by selling them the required technology
or technical service to enhance their productivity/operability. With its outsourced technical arm and its commission-based global network
of vendors, the Company expects to create sustainable added value to each project it takes on while generating revenue from the sale of
EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems, EAWD Off-Grid EV Charging Stations, EAWD Off-Grid Power Systems, and EAWD Off-Grid Water Purification Systems,
royalties from the commercialization of energy and water in certain cases, and the licensing of our innovated technologies; as well as
from its engineering, technical consulting, and project management services. 

Through our BlueTech Alliance for Water Generation,
established in December 2020, we have state-of-the-art technology partners, technology transfer agreements, and technology representation
agreements in place relating to aspects of renewable energy and water supply. These unique key relationships offer important selling features
and capabilities that differentiated EAWD from its competitors. 

The Company plans to generate revenue from the sale
of EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems, EAWD Off-Grid EV Charging Stations, EAWD Off-Grid Power Systems, and EAWD Off-Grid Water Purification Systems,
royalties from the commercialization of energy and water in certain cases, and the licensing of our innovated technologies, as well as
from its engineering, technical consulting, and project management services. 

25 

Contractual Obligations 

 Our principal commitments consist mostly of
obligations under the loans described above. 

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

 Critical Accounting Policies 

 The preparation of the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These
estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

 For a description of the accounting policies that,
in management s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could, if
different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 26, 2024.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

 As required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange
Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30,
2024. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer determined that, because
of the material weaknesses described in Item 9A Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023, which we are still in the process of remediating as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective. Investors are directed to Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for
the description of these weaknesses. 

 Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

 We have evaluated the material weakness described
above and our management and board of directors are committed to the design and successful implementation of internal control over financial
reporting as promptly as possible. We currently plan to evaluate our updated internal controls design and determine whether the controls
have operated effectively during 2024 in order to fully remediate the aforementioned material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting. 

 As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our management has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses,
and in the third quarter of 2024, we continued to implement the following remedial procedures: 

We have welcomed a new part-time Chief Financial Officer to our team and augmented our staff with specialized accounting consultants. 

We are in the process of codifying our policies and procedures, which will significantly enhance the cohesion between our financial operations and other non-accounting divisions. 

We are also collaborating with external experts to ensure that our remediation efforts are both efficient and comprehensive. 

We intend to complete the remediation of the material
weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing
an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business
and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately
satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weaknesses
that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we
discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation,
as needed. 

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 Other than in connection with the implementation
of the remedial measures described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the third quarter
of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
