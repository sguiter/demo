 . 10. Substandard loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if applicable. These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses which jeopardize repayment according to the contractual terms. There is distinct loss potential if the weaknesses are not corrected. Includes loans with insufficient cash flow coverage which are collateral dependent, other real estate owned, and repossessed assets. 11. Doubtful loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in a Substandard loan, with the added characteristic that existing weaknesses make full principal collection, based on current facts, conditions, and values, highly doubtful. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of pending factors, recognition of a loss is deferred until a more exact status can be determined. All doubtful loans will be placed on non-accrual, with all payments, including interest, applied to principal reduction. 
 The credit quality indicator for leases and equipment financing agreements remains unchanged at performing and nonperforming status.

Of this number, securities were in an unrealized loss position. The aggregate losses of these securities totaled approximately of the total amortized cost of the portfolio. Of these securities, there were securities that had an unrealized loss for twelve months or more due to the current rate environment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s impairment evaluation determined that one publicly traded debt security experienced a decline in fair value due to credit quality, rather than market factors. As a result, the Company recognized a credit loss expense of thousand in the first quarter of 2023 and established an ACL on the related AFS security. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the remaining ACL on the related AFS security was removed as the security had been sold. The following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for held to maturity and available for sale securities by major security type for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Reduction due to sales ) Provision for credit loss expense ) Balance, ending Trading securities had a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023, and consist of retained beneficial interests acquired in conjunction with Freddie Mac securitizations completed by the Company in 2023 and 2024. The change in fair value on trading securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a net loss of thousand. The change in market value on trading securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a net gain of thousand. See also Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of these securitizations.

 Gross gains from sales of securities Gross losses from sales of securities ) The amortized cost and fair value of securities as of September 30, 2024 by contractual maturity are shown below. Expected maturities of residential mortgage-backed and related securities and asset-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities because the residential mortgages underlying the securities may be prepaid without any penalties. Therefore, these securities are not included in the maturity categories in the following table: Due after one year through five years Due after five years Securities AFS: Due in one year or less Due after one year through five years Due after five years Residential mortgage-backed and related securities Asset-backed securities Portions of the U.S. government sponsored agency securities and municipal securities as of September 30, 2024, contain call options, which, at the discretion of the issuer, terminate the security at par and at predetermined dates prior to the stated maturity, summarized as follows: Securities AFS: Municipal securities Other securities As of September 30, 2024, the Company's municipal securities portfolios were comprised of general obligation bonds issued by issuers with fair values totaling million and revenue bonds, issued by issuers, primarily consisting of states, counties, towns, villages and school districts with fair values totaling million. The Company also held investments in general obligation bonds in states, including states in which the aggregate fair value exceeded million, and in revenue bonds in states, including states in which the aggregate fair value exceeded million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's municipal securities portfolios were comprised of general obligation bonds issued by issuers with fair values totaling million and revenue bonds, issued by issuers, primarily consisting of states, counties, towns, villages and school districts with fair values totaling million.

 issuers, both located in Ohio, of which the aggregate book or market value exceeded of the Company s stockholders equity. The issuers financial conditions are strong and the sources of repayment are diversified. The Company monitors the investments and concentration closely. Of the general obligation and revenue bonds in the Company's portfolio, the majority are unrated bonds that represent small, private issuances. All unrated bonds were underwritten according to the Company s loan underwriting standards and have an average loan risk rating of 2, indicating Superior Quality. Additionally, many of these bonds are funding essential municipal services such as water, sewer, education, and medical facilities. The Company's municipal securities are owned by the charters, whose investment policies set forth limits for various subcategories within the municipal securities portfolio. The investments of each charter are monitored individually, and as of September 30, 2024, all were within policy limitations approved by the Company s board of directors. Policy limits are calculated as a percentage of each charter's total risk-based capital. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's standard monitoring of its municipal securities portfolio had not uncovered any facts or circumstances resulting in significantly different credit ratings than those assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or in the case of unrated bonds, the rating assigned using the credit underwriting standards.

As of September 30, 2024, there were multi-family loans held for sale in preparation for securitization totaling million. There were loans held for sale in preparation for securitization at December 31, 2023. Management performs an evaluation of the estimated unguaranteed residual values of leased assets on an annual basis, at a minimum. The evaluation consists of discussions with reputable and current vendors, which is combined with management's expertise and understanding of the current states of particular industries to determine informal valuations of the equipment. As necessary and where available, management will utilize valuations by independent appraisers. The majority of leases with residual values contain a lease options rider, which requires the lessee to pay the residual value directly, finance the payment of the residual value, or extend the lease term to pay the residual value. In these cases, the residual value is protected and the risk of loss is minimal. Includes residential real estate held for sale totaling million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The swaptions are designed to hedge the Company s regulatory capital ratios against the adverse effects of a significant decline in long-term interest rates.

These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an equal and offsetting interest rate swap with an upstream counterparty. Additionally, the Company receives an upfront, non-refundable fee from the upstream counterparty, dependent upon the pricing that is recognized upon receipt from the counterparty. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for the customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts, for the most part, offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company s results of operations. Interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments are summarized as follows: Non-Hedging Interest Rate Derivatives Liabilities: Interest rate swap contracts

Interest rate swaps are also executed for select commercial customers. The fair values are determined by pricing models that consider observable market data for derivative instruments with similar structures (Level 2 inputs). Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when a loan/lease is collaterally dependent). Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis comprised the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: Loans receivable held for sale in preparation for securitization OREO Other repossessed assets December 31, 2023: Loans/leases evaluated individually OREO Loans/leases evaluated individually are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans/leases. Collateral may be comprised of real estate and/or business assets, including equipment, inventory and/or accounts receivable, and is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Company. Appraised and reported values are discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business.

 Part I Item 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION This section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries as of and for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024. Some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends. When reading this discussion, also refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in this report. Page locations and specific sections and notes that are referred to in this discussion are listed in the table of contents. Additionally, a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. GENERAL The Company was formed in February 1993 for the purpose of organizing QCBT. Over the past thirty-one years, the Company has grown to include four banking subsidiaries and a number of nonbanking subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 9.1 billion in consolidated assets, including 6.8 billion in net loans/leases, and 7.0 billion in deposits. The financial results of acquired entities for the periods since their acquisition are included in this report. Further information related to acquired entities has been presented in the annual reports previously filed with the SEC corresponding to the year of each acquisition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information contained within these statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance, impairment of goodwill, the fair value of financial instruments, and the fair value of securities. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, management has identified the following as critical accounting policies and estimates: Goodwill Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases and Off-Balance Sheet Exposures Fair Value of Loans Acquired in Business Combinations Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value of Securities 
 A more detailed discussion of these critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 accretion increased by 195 thousand from the prior quarter. Net interest income increased 3 when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher average earning assets. Provision expense in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 2.0 million as compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased 322 thousand when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to overall credit quality improvements. Provision expense in the first nine months of 2024 increased 609 thousand compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was due to strong loan growth and the impact of our qualitative CECL model factors. In addition, there was negative provision of 445 thousand on AFS securities for the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of a debt investment in a failed bank. See the Provision for Credit Losses section of this report for additional details. Noninterest income in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 3.7 million, or 12 , compared to the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in the third quarter compared to the linked quarter was primarily due to lower BOLI due to realized income of 2.2 million from BOLI policy proceeds received during the second quarter of 2024 and capital markets revenue from swap fees, offset by higher wealth management revenue. The demand for low-income housing remains healthy and the economics associated with these tax credit projects continue to be favorable. The Company has a strong pipeline for this business and expects it to continue to be a solid source of fee income in 2024. Noninterest income increased 564 thousand, or 2 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest income decreased 51 thousand when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period of the prior year. During the third quarter, the Company executed a derivative strategy with a notional value of approximately 410.0 million. These derivatives are designed to safeguard the Company s regulatory capital against the adverse effects of a significant decline in long-term interest rates. These derivatives are unhedged and are marked-to-market, with gains or losses recorded in noninterest income and reflected as a non-core item. For the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a 414 thousand loss on these derivatives. Noninterest expense increased 3.7 million, or 7 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. Noninterest expense increased 2.5 million, or 5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The linked-quarter increase was primarily due to the previously announced one-time restructuring and goodwill impairment charges related to the decision to discontinue offering new loans and leases at m2. Noninterest expense increased 4.6 million, or 3 , when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher professional and data processing expense as well as restructuring and goodwill impairment expenses related due to the decision to discontinue offering new loans and leases through m2. 
 STRATEGIC FINANCIAL METRICS The Company has established certain strategic financial metrics by which it manages its business and measures its performance. The goals are periodically updated to reflect changes in business developments. While the Company is determined to work prudently to achieve these metrics, there is no assurance that they will be met. Moreover, the Company's ability to achieve these metrics may be affected by the factors discussed under Forward Looking Statements as well as the factors detailed in the Risk Factors section included under Item 1A. of Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company's long-term strategic financial metrics are as follows: Generate loan and lease growth of 9 per year, funded by core deposits; Grow fee-based income by at least 6 per year; and Limit our annual operating expense growth to 5 per year.

 The following table shows the evaluation of the Company s strategic financial metrics: 

Year to Date Strategic Financial Metric Key Metric Target September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Loan and lease growth organically Loans and leases growth > 9 annually 5.8 12.4 10.2 Fee income growth Fee income growth > 6 annually (16.8) (13.5) 45.8 Improve operational efficiencies and hold noninterest expense growth Noninterest expense growth (3.8) (4.4) 10.2 Ratios and amounts provided for these measurements represent year-to-date actual amounts for the respective period that are then annualized for comparison to the prior year actual. The calculations provided exclude non-core noninterest income and noninterest expense. It should be noted that these initiatives are long-term targets. STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENTS The Company has taken the following actions during the third quarter of 2024 to support its corporate strategy: The Company completed a LIHTC loan securitization through a Freddie Mac sponsored M series transaction in the third quarter of 2024. The securitization consisted of tax exempt LIHTC loans with a total outstanding principal balance of 232.4 million and a total carrying value of 230.7 million. The Company recorded a net loss on the transactions of 473 thousand, which is reported in capital markets revenue on the Company s consolidated statements of income. The Company plans to continue to utilize securitizations as a liquidity and concentration management tool, and to provide additional capacity to produce LIHTC loans and the related capital markets revenue. The Company experienced a decrease in the amount of loans and leases in the third quarter of 2024 of 1.5 on an annualized basis as a result of the securitization. Included in total loans and leases was 165.9 million of LIHTC loans held for sale in anticipation of the Company s next loan securitization. Excluding the impact of the loans securitized during the third quarter, loan growth is 10.5 annualized. 
 Correspondent banking has continued to be a core line of business for the Company. The Company is competitively positioned with experienced staff, software systems and processes to continue growing in the four states currently served Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois. The Company acted as the correspondent bank through QCBT for 188 downstream banks with total noninterest bearing deposits of 109.3 million and total interest-bearing deposits of 714.6 million as of September 30, 2024. By comparison, the Company acted as the correspondent bank for 180 downstream banks with total noninterest bearing deposits of 93.0 million and total interest-bearing deposits of 308.2 million as of September 30, 2023. This line of business provides a strong source of deposits, fee income, high-quality loan participations and bank stock loans. The Company also manages off-balance sheet liquidity held at the Federal Reserve on behalf of the downstream banks of 438.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 258.4 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company is focused on executing interest rate swaps on select commercial loans, including LIHTC permanent loans. These interest rate swaps allow commercial borrowers to pay a fixed interest rate while the Company receives a variable interest rate as well as an upfront nonrefundable fee dependent on the pricing. Management believes that these swaps help position the Company more favorably for various interest rate environments. The Company will continue to review opportunities to execute these swaps at all of its subsidiary banks as appropriate for applicable borrowers and the Company. Levels of capital markets revenue from swap fee income are influenced by prevailing interest rates. Capital markets revenue, primarily from swap fee income, totaled 16.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 15.6 million for the same period of the prior year. Capital markets revenue, primarily from swap fee income, totaled 50.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 55.1 million for the same period of the prior year.

 Over many years, the Company has been successful in expanding its wealth management client base. Trust and investment advisory and management fees continue to be a significant contributor to noninterest income. Assets under management increased by 343.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased by 941.1 million for the first nine months of 2024. Income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services. The majority of trust fees are determined based on the value of the investments managed. The Company expects trust and investment advisory and management fees to be negatively impacted during periods of lower market valuations and positively impacted during periods of higher market valuations. The Company has recently expanded its wealth management client base into the Springfield, Missouri market and the Des Moines, Iowa metropolitan market. Noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 154.1 million as compared to 149.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased professional and data processing fees due to information technology investment growth as well as restructuring and goodwill impairment expenses related due to the decision to discontinue offering new loans and leases through m2. 
 GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS The following table presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to the TCE/TA ratio , adjusted net income , adjusted EPS , adjusted ROAA , NIM (TEY) , adjusted NIM (TEY) and efficiency ratio. In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, all non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, as follows: TCE/TA ratio (non-GAAP) is reconciled to stockholders equity and total assets; Adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted ROAA (all non-GAAP measures) are reconciled to net income; NIM (TEY) (non-GAAP) and adjusted NIM (TEY) (non-GAAP) are reconciled to NIM; and Adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) is reconciled to noninterest expense, net interest income and noninterest income. 
 The TCE/TA non-GAAP ratio has been a focus for investors and management believes that this ratio may assist investors in analyzing the Company s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets. The following tables also include several adjusted non-GAAP measurements of financial performance. The Company s management believes that these measures are important to investors as they exclude non-recurring income and expense items; therefore, they provide a better comparison for analysis and may provide a better indicator of future performance. NIM (TEY) is a financial measure that the Company s management utilizes to determine the tax benefit associated with certain tax-exempt loans and securities. It is standard industry practice to measure net interest margin using tax-equivalent measures. In addition, the Company calculates NIM without the impact of acquisition accounting net accretion (adjusted NIM), as accretion amounts can fluctuate widely, making comparisons difficult. The adjusted efficiency ratio and efficiency ratio are utilized by management to compare the Company to its peers. It is a standard ratio used to calculate overhead as a percentage of revenue in the banking industry and is widely utilized by investors. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have

 limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

 NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN- (TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS) Net interest income, on a GAAP basis, increased 8 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same quarter of the prior year. Net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis (non-GAAP), increased 10 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was driven by higher average earning assets and margin expansion. A comparison of yields, spread and margin on a tax equivalent and GAAP basis is as follows:

In evaluating net interest income and NIM, it is important to understand the impact of acquisition accounting net accretion when comparing periods. The above table reports NIM with and without the acquisition accounting net accretion to allow for more appropriate comparisons. A comparison of acquisition accounting net accretion included in NIM is as follows:

From a profitability standpoint, an important challenge for the Company s subsidiary banks and leasing company is focusing on quality growth in conjunction with the improvement of their NIMs. Management continually addresses this issue with pricing and other balance sheet strategies which include better loan pricing, reducing reliance on very rate-sensitive funding, closely managing deposit rate changes and finding additional ways to manage cost of funds through derivatives.

(3) Loan/lease fees are not material and are included in interest income from loans/leases receivable in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidance. 
 The Company s operating results are also impacted by various sources of noninterest income, including trust fees, investment advisory and management fees, deposit service fees, capital markets revenue, gains from the sales of residential real estate loans and government guaranteed loans, earnings on BOLI and other income. Offsetting these items, the Company incurs noninterest expenses, which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, professional and data processing fees, FDIC and other insurance expense, loan/lease expense and other administrative expenses. The Company s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, income tax rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. For a discussion of the factors that could have a material impact on the operations and future prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, see the Risk Factors section included under Item 1A of Part I of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTEREST INCOME Interest income increased 16.9 million, comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of 2023, and increased 59.1 million when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period of 2023. Interest income (tax equivalent non-GAAP) increased 18.6 million, comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of 2023, and increased 65.6 million when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period of 2023. This increase in interest income across 

 47 

Table of Contents Part I Item 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS continued 
 both periods was primarily due to higher loan and investment average balances and margin expansion from higher loan yields. The Company intends to continue to grow quality loans and leases as well as its private placement tax-exempt securities portfolio to maximize yield while minimizing credit and interest rate risk. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased 12.4 million, comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of 2023, and increased 53.8 million, comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period of 2023. The increase across both periods was due to the higher cost of funds as well as an increase in interest bearing and time deposits with lower noninterest bearing deposits. The Company s cost of funds was 3.44 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase from 3.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company s cost of funds was 3.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase from 2.64 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The ACL is established through provision expense to provide an estimated ACL. The following table shows the components of the provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) Provision for credit losses - loans and leases 3,828 3,260 11,907 9,031 Provision for credit losses - off-balance sheet exposures (344) 546 487 1,320 Provision for credit losses - available for sale securities (445) 989 Total provision for credit losses 3,484 3,806 11,949 11,340 The Company had a total provision for credit losses on loans and leases of 3.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, which is an increase from 3.3 million for the same period of 2023, primarily driven by loan growth during the quarter. The provision related to OBS was negative 344 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 546 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to a decreased balance in unfunded commitments, improved credit quality and updates to the CECL model factors. There was no provision related to HTM securities for the third quarter of 2024 or 2023. There was no provision related to AFS securities for the third quarter of 2024 or 2023. Provision for loans and leases for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 11.9 million, an increase from 9.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in provision on loans and leases was primarily driven by loan growth. The provision related to OBS was 487 thousand for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a provision related to OBS of 1.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was due to a decreased balance in unfunded commitments, improved credit quality and updates to the CECL model factors. There was no provision related to HTM securities for the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. There was a provision of 989 thousand and negative provision of 445 thousand on AFS securities for the first nine months of 2023 and 2024, respectively, resulting from the write off in 2023 and subsequent change in fair value in 2024, of a debt investment in a failed bank. This was a legacy investment acquired as part of the 2022 GFED acquisition in which an allowance was established for the entire balance of the bond in March 2023 and due to favorable changes in market conditions during 2024, partially recovered in value and was then sold during the first quarter of 2024. The ACL for loans and leases is established based on a number of factors, including the Company's historical loss experience, delinquencies and charge-off trends, economic and other forecasts, the local, state and national economies and risk associated with the loans/leases and securities in the portfolio, as described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates section of this discussion.

Table of Contents Part I Item 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS continued 
 The Company had an ACL for loans/leases held for investment of 1.30 of total gross loans/leases held for investment at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.33 at June 30, 2024 and 1.39 at September 30, 2023. Management has evaluated the allowance needed on the loans acquired prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2021, factoring in the remaining discount, which was 2.8 million and 4.6 million at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Additional discussion of the Company's allowance can be found in the Financial Condition section of this Report. NONINTEREST INCOME The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Trust fees 3,270 2,863 407 14.2 Investment advisory and management fees 1,229 947 282 29.8 Deposit service fees 2,294 2,107 187 8.9 Gains on sales of residential real estate loans, net 385 476 (91) (19.1) Capital markets revenue 16,290 15,596 694 4.4 Earnings on bank-owned life insurance 814 1,807 (993) (55.0) Debit card fees 1,575 1,584 (9) (0.6) Correspondent banking fees 507 450 57 12.7 Loan related fee income 949 800 149 18.6 Fair value loss on derivatives and trading securities (886) (336) (550) (163.7) Other 730 299 431 144.1 Total noninterest income 27,157 26,593 564 2.1 

Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Trust fees 9,572 8,613 959 11.1 Investment advisory and management fees 3,544 2,812 732 26.0 Deposit service fees 6,302 6,169 133 2.2 Gains on sales of residential real estate loans, net 1,307 1,288 19 1.5 Gains on sales of government guaranteed portions of loans, net 36 30 6 20.0 Capital markets revenue 50,505 55,109 (4,604) (8.4) Securities losses, net (451) 451 100.0 Earnings on bank-owned life insurance 4,646 3,352 1,294 38.6 Debit card fees 4,612 4,639 (27) (0.6) Correspondent banking fees 1,529 1,197 332 27.7 Loan related fee income 2,747 2,221 526 23.7 Fair value loss on derivatives and trading securities (998) (680) (318) (46.8) Other 1,102 656 446 68.0 Total noninterest income 84,904 84,955 (51) (0.1) The Company continues to be successful in expanding its wealth management client base and new assets under management. Trust fees continue to be a significant contributor to noninterest income. Assets under management have increased 343.9 million since June 30, 2024 and have increased by 1.4 billion since September 30, 2023 due to market fluctuation and new client additions. Income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services. Trust fees are primarily determined based on the market value of the investments within the fully-managed trusts. Trust fees increased 14 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year and increased 11 when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023 due to market performance and new assets under management. The Company expects trust fees to be negatively

 impacted during periods of significantly lower market valuations and positively impacted during periods of significantly higher market valuations. Investment advisory and management fees increased 30 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 26 when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. Similar to trust fees, investment advisory and management fees are largely determined based on the market value of the investments managed. As a result, fee income from this line of business fluctuates with market valuations. Deposit service fees increased 9 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year, and increased 2 when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company s total deposits increased by 470.6 million, or 7 . When comparing annualized YTD growth of total deposits, the Company continues to be successful in expanding its core deposit base with a targeted focus on growing the number of net new accounts in 2024. Gains on sales of residential real estate loans, net, decreased 19 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 2 when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was due to lower volume of client residential real estate purchase activity generating lower levels of gains. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in gains was due to overall higher volume of client residential real estate purchase activity from the same period in the prior year. The Company has grown its capital markets revenue significantly over the past several years. The Company s interest rate swap program consists of back-to-back interest rate swaps with two types of commercial borrowers: (1) traditional commercial loans of a certain minimum size and sophistication, and (2) LIHTC permanent loans. Most of the growth has been in the latter category as the Company has grown relationships with strong LIHTC developers with many years of experience. The LIHTC industry is strong and growing with an increased need for affordable housing. The back-to-back interest rate swaps allow commercial borrowers to pay a fixed interest rate while the Company receives a variable interest rate as well as an upfront nonrefundable fee dependent upon the pricing from an upstream counter party. Capital markets revenue totaled 16.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 15.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Capital markets revenue totaled 50.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 55.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. In the traditional commercial portfolio, the pricing is more competitive and the duration is shorter as compared to the LIHTC permanent loans. Therefore, the mix of loans with interest rate swaps continued to be heavily weighted towards LIHTC permanent loans. Future levels of swap fees are dependent upon the needs of our traditional commercial and LIHTC borrowers, and the size of the related nonrefundable swap fee may fluctuate depending on the interest rate environment. Also included in capital markets revenue are gains/losses on loan securitizations. The Company closed on 232.4 million of LIHTC loans for securitization in the third quarter of 2024 which resulted in a loss of 473 thousand. LIHTC securitizations will likely be used in the future as a tool to provide capacity for continued LIHTC loan production. There were no securities gains or losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Securities losses totaled 451 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company sold 29.0 million of securities during the first quarter of 2023. The securities sold were part of a strategy to partially deleverage the Company s balance sheet with an anticipated rapid earn back of the modest loss before the end of the calendar year. Earnings on BOLI decreased 55 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023 and increased 39 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The change was due primarily to 2.2 million of death benefit proceeds on BOLI received in the second quarter of 2024. There were no purchases of BOLI in the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. Notably, a portion of the Company's BOLI is variable rate whereby returns are determined by the performance of the equity markets. Management intends to continue to review its BOLI investments to be consistent with 

 50 

Table of Contents Part I Item 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS continued 
 policy and regulatory limits in conjunction with the rest of its earning assets in an effort to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Debit card fees are the interchange fees paid on certain debit card customer transactions. Debit card fees remained stable comparing the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year, and also comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The fees can vary based on customer debit card usage, so fluctuations from period to period may occur. As an opportunity to maximize fees, the Company offers a deposit product with a higher interest rate that incentivizes debit card activity. Correspondent banking fees increased 13 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 28 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to a shift of correspondent banking balances from non-interest bearing accounts to interest bearing accounts, in light of increasing rates. Fees from correspondent banks generally increase when non-interest bearing account balances decrease due to lower associated earnings credits. Correspondent banking continues to be a core strategy for the Company, as this line of business provides a high level of deposits that can be used to fund loan growth as well as a steady source of fee income. The Company now serves 188 banks in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin. Loan-related fee income increased 19 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 24 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase across both periods was primarily due to the growth in our commercial credit card portfolio. Fair value loss on derivatives and trading securities was 886 thousand in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 336 thousand in losses in the same period of the prior year. Fair value loss on derivatives and trading securities was 998 thousand in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 680 thousand in the first nine months of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company executed a derivative strategy with a notional value of approximately 410 million. These derivatives are unhedged and are marked-to-market, with gains or losses recorded in noninterest income which was a contributing factor in the increase in fair value losses. The Company uses unhedged cap instruments and swaptions to manage interest rate risk related to the variability of interest payments due to changes in interest rates. Fair value gains or losses will fluctuate depending on the interest rate environment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other noninterest income increased 431 thousand, or 144 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year due to improvements on the market value of the Company s equity investments. Other noninterest income increased 446 thousand, or 68 , comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. Included in other noninterest income is income on equity investments. Income on equity investments is largely determined based on the market value of the investments managed. As a result, income fluctuates with market valuations.

 NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following tables set forth the various categories of noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 31,637 32,098 (461) (1.4) Occupancy and equipment expense 6,168 6,228 (60) (1.0) Professional and data processing fees 4,457 4,456 1 0.0 Restructuring expense 1,954 1,954 100.0 FDIC insurance, other insurance and regulatory fees 1,711 1,721 (10) (0.6) Loan/lease expense 587 826 (239) (28.9) Net cost of (income from) and gains/losses on operations of real estate (42) 3 (45) (1,500.0) Advertising and marketing 2,124 1,429 695 48.6 Communication and data connectivity 333 478 (145) (30.3) Supplies 278 335 (57) (17.0) Bank service charges 603 605 (2) (0.3) Correspondent banking expense 325 232 93 40.1 Intangibles amortization 690 691 (1) (0.1) Goodwill impairment 432 432 100.0 Payment card processing 785 733 52 7.1 Trust expense 395 432 (37) (8.6) Other 1,128 814 314 38.6 Total noninterest expense 53,565 51,081 2,484 4.9 

Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 94,576 95,560 (984) (1.0) Occupancy and equipment expense 19,059 18,242 817 4.5 Professional and data processing fees 13,893 12,048 1,845 15.3 Restructuring expense 1,954 1,954 100.0 Post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs 207 (207) (100.0) FDIC insurance, other insurance and regulatory fees 5,510 5,022 488 9.7 Loan/lease expense 1,116 2,034 (918) (45.1) Net cost of (income from) and gains/losses on operations of other real estate (44) (64) 20 (31.3) Advertising and marketing 5,172 4,401 771 17.5 Communication and data connectivity 1,052 1,614 (562) (34.8) Supplies 812 921 (109) (11.8) Bank service charges 1,793 1,831 (38) (2.1) Correspondent banking expense 993 663 330 49.8 Intangibles amortization 2,070 2,222 (152) (6.8) Goodwill Impairment 432 432 100.0 Payment card processing 2,137 1,820 317 17.4 Trust expense 1,199 983 216 22.0 Other 2,419 2,089 330 15.8 Total noninterest expense 154,143 149,593 4,550 3.0 Management places a strong emphasis on overall cost containment and is committed to improving the Company's general efficiency. Salaries and employee benefits, which is the largest component of noninterest expense, decreased 1 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year and when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023 due to lower variable compensation and lower FTEs. 

 52 

Table of Contents Part I Item 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS continued 
 Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 1 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 5 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was due to higher IT service contracts expense and depreciation. Professional and data processing fees remained stable comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 15 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was due primarily to increased CDARS and ICS expenses as well as increased data processing expenses. Generally, professional and data processing fees can fluctuate depending on certain one-time project costs. Management will continue to focus on minimizing such one-time costs and driving recurring costs down through contract negotiation or managed reduction in activity where costs are determined on a usage basis. Restructuring expenses totaled 2.0 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 due to the decision to discontinue offering new loans and leases through m2. The charges consisted primarily of severance and retention compensation as well as vendor contract termination fees. There were no restructuring expenses in 2023. There were no post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs in 2024, whereas such costs totaled 207 thousand in the first nine months of 2023. These costs were comprised primarily of IT integration and data conversion costs related to the acquisition of GFED. FDIC insurance, other insurance and regulatory fee expense remained stable when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 10 when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in expense for the first nine months of 2024 was due to asset growth and higher FDIC insurance rates. Loan/lease expense decreased 29 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same quarter of the prior year, and decreased 45 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was due primarily to lower legal expense on loan workouts and higher recoveries of legal expenses incurred on loan workouts. Generally, loan/lease expense has a direct relationship with the level of NPLs; however, it may deviate depending upon the individual NPLs, as NPLs have increased 1 since September 30, 2023. Net cost of (income from) and gains/losses on operations of other real estate includes gains/losses on the sale of OREO, write-downs of OREO and all income/expenses associated with OREO. Net income from and gains/losses on operations of other real estate for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 42 thousand, compared to net cost of and gains/losses on operations of other real estate of 3 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. Net income from and gain/losses on operations of other real estate totaled 44 thousand for the first nine months of 2024, compared to net income from and gains/losses on operations of other real estate of 64 thousand for the first nine months of 2023. Advertising and marketing expense increased 49 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 18 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in expense compared to the linked quarter was primarily due to the increased marketing of our deposit products. Communication and data connectivity expense decreased 30 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and decreased 35 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to improvements to our data center connectivity channels and a reduction in cell phone and air card expenses as the Company continues to improve operational efficiencies. Supplies expense decreased 17 comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and decreased 12 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. This decrease is primarily due to the timing of purchases. Bank service charges, a large portion of which includes indirect costs incurred to provide services to QCBT's correspondent banking customer portfolio, remained stable when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year,

 and decreased 2 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. As transaction volumes and the number of correspondent banking clients fluctuate, the associated expenses are expected to also fluctuate. Correspondent banking expense increased 40 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 50 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in correspondent expenses includes planned costs for an upgraded safekeeping platform. These are direct costs incurred to provide services to QCBT's correspondent banking customer portfolio, including safekeeping and cash management services. Intangibles amortization expense remained stable when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and decreased 7 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The amortization expense is due to the prior acquisitions. These expenses will naturally decrease as intangibles become fully amortized unless there is an addition to intangible assets. Goodwill impairment expense totaled 432 thousand for the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024 due to the decision to discontinue offering new loans and leases through m2. There was no goodwill impairment expense in 2023. Payment card processing expense increased 7 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 17 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023 due to an increased volume of transactions. Trust expense decreased 9 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 22 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 as compared of the same period of the prior year was primarily due to additional costs for the planned system conversions of the trust and tax accounting platforms that occurred during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in trust expense for the first nine months of 2024 was due to assets under management growth. Other noninterest expense increased 39 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of the prior year, and increased 16 comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased insurance claim loss reserves at our QCRH Risk Management micro captive entity. Included in other noninterest expense are items such as meals and entertainment, subscriptions and sales and use tax. INCOME TAXES In the third quarter of 2024, the Company incurred income tax expense of 2.0 million, compared to income tax expense of 1.8 million in the same period of the prior year. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company incurred income tax expense of 5.8 million, compared to income tax expense of 8.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The Company continues to benefit from increased levels of tax exempt income due to strong growth in tax-exempt loan and bond portfolios. As a result, this has helped drive the Company s effective tax rate lower for both the three and nine months

The Company s net loans/leases decreased 24.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in net loans/leases was driven primarily by a decrease in loans held for sale with the closing of a loan securitization in the third quarter of 2024. Loans and leases held for investment increased 53.5 million as compared to the second quarter of 2024. The Company continues to experience strong loan demand from its LIHTC lending business. Deposits increased 220.0 million, or 3 , during the third quarter of 2024. Borrowings decreased 108.3 million, or 14 , during the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to strong deposit growth reducing funding needs. INVESTMENT SECURITIES The composition of the Company s securities portfolio is managed to meet liquidity needs while prioritizing the impact on interest rate risk, maximizing return and minimizing credit risk. Over the years, the Company has further invested in tax-exempt municipal securities made up of 11 general obligation bonds and 89 revenue bonds. The majority are privately placed tax-exempt debt issuances by municipalities located in the Midwest (with some in or near the Company's existing markets) and diversified across many issuers. The Company monitors the investments and concentration closely. Of the general obligation and revenue bonds in the Company's portfolio, the majority are unrated bonds that represent small, private issuances that require a thorough underwriting process before investment and are generated by our specialty finance group. Trading securities had a fair value of 58.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and consisted of retained beneficial interests acquired in conjunction with loan securitizations completed by the Company in 2023 and 2024. The change in market value on trading securities was a net loss of 200 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a net gain of 52 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See also Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of these securitizations.

As CRE loans have historically been the Company's largest portfolio segment, management places a strong emphasis on the underwriting and monitoring of the characteristics and composition of the Company's CRE loan portfolio. For example, management tracks the level of owner-occupied CRE loans relative to non-owner-occupied loans because owner-occupied loans are generally considered to have less risk. Additionally, the Company reviews CRE concentrations by industry in relation to risk-based capital on a quarterly basis. Approximately 43 of the CRE loan portfolio consists of LIHTC loans, all of which are performing and Pass rated.

 The Company's 1-4 family real estate loan portfolio includes the following: Certain loans that do not meet the criteria for sale into the secondary market. These are often structured as adjustable rate mortgages with maturities ranging from three to seven years to avoid long-term interest rate risk. A limited amount of 15-year, 20-year and 30-year fixed rate residential real estate loans that meet certain credit guidelines. 
 The remaining 1-4 family real estate loans originated by the Company were sold on the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with longer term fixed rate loans. Loans originated for this purpose were classified as held for sale and are included in the residential real estate loans above. The Company has not originated any subprime, Alt-A, no documentation, or stated income residential real estate loans throughout its history.

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's loan and lease portfolio. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS/LEASES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES The adequacy of the ACL was determined by management based on numerous factors, including the overall composition of the loan/lease portfolio, types of loans/leases, historical loss experience, loan/lease delinquencies, potential substandard and doubtful credits, economic conditions, collateral positions, government guarantees and other factors that, in management's judgment, deserved evaluation. To ensure that an adequate ACL was maintained, provisions were made based on a number of factors, including the increase in loans/leases and a detailed analysis of the loan/lease portfolio. The loan/lease portfolio is reviewed and analyzed quarterly with specific detailed reviews completed on all credits risk-rated less than special mention, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and carrying aggregate exposure in excess of 250 thousand. The adequacy of the allowance is monitored by the credit administration staff and reported to management and the board of directors. Changes in the ACL for loans/leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented as follows:

 Changes in the ACL for OBS exposures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented as follows: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Balance, beginning 10,360 6,326 9,529 5,552 Provisions to expense (344) 546 487 1,320 Balance, ending 10,016 6,872 10,016 6,872 The decrease in provision on OBS exposures in the second quarter and the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods of the prior year was driven by a decrease in the balance of unfunded commitments, improvements in credit quality and updates to qualitative CECL model factors. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for OBS exposures was 10.0 million. The Company's levels of criticized and classified loans are reported in the following table: 

As of Internally Assigned Risk Rating September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Special Mention 80,121 85,096 125,308 127,202 Substandard/Classified loans 70,022 80,345 70,425 69,369 Doubtful/Classified loans Criticized Loans 150,143 165,441 195,733 196,571 Criticized Loans as a of Total Loans/Leases 2.20 2.41 2.99 2.98 Classified Loans as a of Total Loans/Leases 1.03 1.17 1.08 1.05 Amounts above include the government guaranteed portion, if any. For the calculation of ACL, the Company assigns internal risk ratings of Pass (Rating 2) for the government guaranteed portion. Criticized loans are defined as loans except for direct financing leases and equipment financing agreements with internally assigned risk ratings of 9, 10, or 11, regardless of performance. Classified loans are defined as loans except for direct financing leases and equipment financing agreements with internally assigned risk ratings of 10 or 11, regardless of performance. Criticized loans and classified loans as a percentage of loans and leases decreased from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024 due to certain larger loans which were paid off or upgraded. The Company continues its strong focus on maintaining credit quality in an effort to limit NPLs. The following table summarizes the trend in allowance as a percentage of gross loans/leases and as a percentage of NPLs: 

As of September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 ACL for loans/leases / Total loans/leases held for investment 1.30 1.33 1.33 1.39 ACL for loans/leases / NPLs 248.21 260.77 265.54 253.61 Although management believes that the ACL at September 30, 2024 was at a level adequate to absorb losses on existing loans/leases, there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that the Company will not be required to make additional provisions in the future. Unpredictable future events could adversely affect cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers, which could cause the Company to experience increases in problem assets, delinquencies and losses on loans/leases, and require further increases in the provision for credit losses. Asset quality is a priority for the Company and its subsidiaries. The ability to grow profitably is in part dependent upon the ability to maintain that quality. The Company continually focuses efforts at its subsidiary banks and equipment financing company with the intention to improve the overall quality of the Company's loan/lease portfolio. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's ACL.

NPAs at September 30, 2024 were 35.7 million, an increase of 1.2 million from June 30, 2024, and an increase of 1.0 million from September 30, 2023. The increase in NPAs during the quarter was driven by two client relationships. The ratio of NPAs to total assets was 0.39 at September 30, 2024, static to June 30, 2024, and a decrease from 0.41 at September 30, 2023. The majority of the NPAs consist of nonaccrual loans/leases. For nonaccrual loans/leases, management has thoroughly reviewed these loans/leases and has provided specific allowances as appropriate. OREO and other repossessed assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The policy of the Company is to place a loan/lease on nonaccrual status if: (a) payment in full of interest or principal is not expected; or (b) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is both in the process of collection and well secured. A loan/lease is well secured if it is secured by collateral with sufficient market value to repay principal and all accrued interest. A debt is in the process of collection if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course either through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to current status. The Company's lending/leasing practices remain unchanged and asset quality remains a priority for management.

 DEPOSITS Deposits increased by 220.0 million during the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to increases in interest-bearing demand deposits and time deposits from both core client and brokered sources. The table below presents the composition of the Company's deposit portfolio: 

As of September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Amount Amount Amount Amount (dollars in thousands) Noninterest bearing demand deposits 969,348 14 956,445 14 1,038,689 16 1,027,791 16 Interest bearing demand deposits 4,715,087 68 4,644,918 69 4,338,390 67 4,416,725 68 Time deposits 942,847 13 859,593 13 851,950 13 788,692 12 Brokered deposits 357,351 5 303,711 4 284,976 4 261,644 4 6,984,633 100 6,764,667 100 6,514,005 100 6,494,852 100 The Company actively participates in the ICS/CDARS program, which is a trusted resource that provides FDIC insurance coverage for clients that maintain larger deposit balances. Deposits in the ICS/CDARS program (which are included in interest-bearing deposits and time deposits in the preceding table) totaled 2.2 billion, or 31.6 of all deposits, as of September 30, 2024. The Company s correspondent bank deposit portfolio and funds managed consists of the following: Noninterest-bearing deposits which represent correspondent banks operating cash used for processing transactions with the Federal Reserve, Money market deposits which represent excess liquidity, and EBA balances of the correspondent banks at the FRB. The Company had total uninsured and uncollateralized deposits of 1.5 billion and 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, or 21 and 20 of total deposits, respectively. Management will continue to focus on growing its core deposit portfolio, including its correspondent banking business at QCBT, as well as shifting the mix from brokered and other higher cost deposits to lower cost core deposits. With the significant success achieved by QCBT in growing its correspondent banking business, QCBT has developed procedures to proactively monitor this industry concentration of deposits and loans. Other deposit-related industry concentrations and large accounts are monitored by the internal asset liability management committees. BORROWINGS The subsidiary banks purchase federal funds for short-term funding needs from the FRB or from their correspondent banks. The table below presents the composition of the Company's short-term borrowings: 

As of September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Federal funds purchased 2,750 1,600 1,500 470 The Company's federal funds purchased fluctuate based on the short-term funding needs of the Company's subsidiary banks.

 As a result of their memberships in the FHLB of Des Moines, the subsidiary banks have the ability to borrow funds for short or long-term purposes under a variety of programs. The subsidiary banks can utilize FHLB advances for loan matching as a hedge against the possibility of changing interest rates and when these advances provide a less costly or more readily available source of funds than customer deposits. The table below presents the Company's FHLB advances as of the periods indicated: 

As of September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Term FHLB advances 145,383 135,000 135,000 135,000 Overnight FHLB advances 230,000 350,000 300,000 295,000 375,383 485,000 435,000 430,000 The Company had an increase of 10.4 million in term FHLB advances from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024. The Company had a decrease in overnight FHLB advances of 120.0 million from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to strong deposit growth resulting in lower funding needs during the third quarter of 2024. It is management's intention to reduce its reliance on wholesale funding, including FHLB advances and brokered deposits. Replacement of this funding with core deposits helps to reduce interest expense as wholesale funding tends to be higher cost. However, the Company may choose to utilize advances and/or brokered deposits to supplement funding needs, as this is a way for the Company to effectively and efficiently manage interest rate risk. The table below presents the maturity schedule including weighted average interest cost for the Company's combined wholesale funding portfolio (defined as FHLB advances and brokered deposits): 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Weighted Weighted Average Average Maturity: Amount Due Interest Rate Amount Due Interest Rate (dollars in thousands) Year ending December 31: 2024 315,067 5.08 584,976 5.45 2025 112,464 4.58 2026 53,236 4.91 45,000 5.01 2027 87,352 4.45 45,000 4.82 2028 97,628 4.29 45,000 4.64 Thereafter 66,987 3.30 Total Wholesale Funding 732,734 4.65 719,976 5.33 During the first nine months of 2024, wholesale funding increased 12.8 million due to funding needs as a result of strong loan growth. The Company renewed its revolving credit note in the second quarter of 2024. At renewal, the available amount under the line of credit remained unchanged at 50.0 million for which there was no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. Interest on the revolving line of credit is calculated at the greater of: (a) the effective Prime Rate less 0.50 or (b) 3.00 per annum. The collateral on the revolving line of credit is 100 of the outstanding stock of the Company s bank subsidiaries. The Company had subordinated notes totaling 233.4 million and 233.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The Company had junior subordinated debentures totaling 48.8 million and 48.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY The table below presents the composition of the Company's stockholders' equity: 

As of September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Common stock 16,861 16,825 16,749 16,732 Additional paid in capital 373,812 372,378 370,814 369,833 Retained earnings 635,589 608,816 554,992 523,142 AOCI (49,642) (61,700) (55,959) (81,324) Total stockholders' equity 976,620 936,319 886,596 828,383 TCE / TA ratio (non-GAAP) 9.24 9.00 8.75 8.05 TCE/TA ratio is defined as total common stockholders' equity excluding goodwill and other intangibles divided by total assets. This ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. See GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, no preferred stock was outstanding. On May 19, 2022, the board of directors of the Company approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time as the Company deems appropriate, up to 1,500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock, or approximately 10 of the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2021. No shares were repurchased during the first nine months of 2024. There were 760,915 shares of common stock remaining for repurchase as of September 30, 2024. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock, and other than repurchases that have been completed to date, there is no assurance that the Company will do so. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares of common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The number, timing and price of shares repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, availability of funds, and other factors, including opportunities to deploy the Company's capital. The Company may, in its discretion, begin, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time prior to the program s expiration, without any prior notice. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity measures the ability of the Company to meet maturing obligations and its existing commitments, to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels, to fund its operations, and to provide for customer credit needs. The Company monitors liquidity risk through contingency planning stress testing on a regular basis. The Company seeks to avoid an over-concentration of funding sources and to establish and maintain contingent funding facilities that can be drawn upon if normal funding sources become unavailable. One source of liquidity is cash and short-term assets, such as interest-bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold, which totaled 263.0 million and 184.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s on-balance sheet liquidity position can fluctuate based on short-term activity in deposits and loans. The subsidiary banks have a variety of sources of short-term liquidity available to them, including federal funds purchased from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, wholesale structured repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, lines of credit, borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, sales of securities AFS, and loan/lease participations or sales. The Company also generates liquidity from the regular principal payments and prepayments made on its loan/lease portfolio and on the regular monthly payments on its securities portfolio.

 At September 30, 2024, the subsidiary banks had 26 lines of credit totaling 867.4 million with upstream correspondent banks, of which 416.6 million was secured and 450.8 million was unsecured. At September 30, 2024, the Company had the full 867.4 million available. At December 31, 2023, the subsidiary banks had 25 lines of credit totaling 699.3 million with upstream correspondent banks, of which 248.5 million was secured and 470.8 million was unsecured. At December 31, 2023, 699.3 million was available. The Company has emphasized growing the number and amount of lines of credit in an effort to strengthen this contingent source of liquidity. Additionally, the Company maintains a 50.0 million secured revolving credit note with a variable interest rate and a maturity of June 30, 2025. At September 30, 2024, the full 50.0 million was available. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 823.9 million in actual correspondent banking deposits spread over 188 relationships. While the Company believes that these funds are relatively stable, there is the potential for large fluctuations that can impact liquidity. Seasonality and the liquidity needs of these correspondent banks can impact balances. Management closely monitors these fluctuations and runs stress scenarios to measure the impact on liquidity and interest rate risk with various levels of correspondent deposit run-off. Investing activities used cash of 670.0 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 426.5 million for the same period of 2023. The net decrease in federal funds sold was 22.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to a net decrease of 36.6 million for the same period of 2023. The net increase in interest-bearing deposits at financial institutions was 41.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to a net decrease of 7.0 million for the same period of 2023. Proceeds from calls, maturities, and paydowns of securities were 48.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 87.7 million for the same period of 2023. Purchases of securities used cash of 148.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 102.7 million for the same period of 2023. Proceeds from sales of securities were 445 thousand for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 30.6 million for the same period of 2023. The net increase in loans/leases used cash of 525.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a net increase in loans of 479.8 million for the same period of 2023. Financing activities provided cash of 409.5 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 385.7 million for same period of 2023. Net increases in deposits totaled 470.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to net increases in deposits of 510.6 million for the same period of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company's short-term borrowings increased 1.3 million, compared to a decrease in short-term borrowings of 129.2 million for the same period of 2023. Long-term FHLB advances during the first nine months of 2024 totaled 10.4 million compared to 135.0 million for the same period of 2023. There were no maturities and principal payments on FHLB term advances in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Net decrease in overnight advances totaled 70.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to net decrease of 120.0 million for the same period of 2023. There were no repurchase and cancellation of shares in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 8.7 million for the same period of 2023. Total cash provided by operating activities was 267.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 85.3 million for the same period of 2023. Throughout its history, the Company has secured additional capital through various sources, including the issuance of common and preferred stock, as well as trust preferred securities and subordinated notes. The Company had one LIHTC securitization that closed in 2024 and two LIHTC securitizations that closed in 2023. LIHTC securitizations may continue to be an ongoing tool in managing liquidity and capital. As of September 30 2024 and December 31, 2023, the subsidiary banks remained well-capitalized in accordance with regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking authorities. Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding regulatory capital.

Table of Contents 
 Part I Item 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company, like other financial institutions, is subject to direct and indirect market risk. Direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates. The Company's net income is dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. In an attempt to manage the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates, management monitors the Company's interest rate risk. Each subsidiary bank has an asset/liability management committee of the board of directors that meets quarterly to review the bank's interest rate risk position and profitability, and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the full board of each bank. Internal asset/liability management teams, consisting of members of the subsidiary banks management, meet bi-weekly to manage the mix of assets and liabilities to maximize earnings and liquidity and minimize interest rate and other risks. Management also reviews the subsidiary banks' securities portfolios, formulates investment strategies, and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board's objectives in an effective manner. Notwithstanding the Company's interest rate risk management activities, the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income. In adjusting the Company's asset/liability position, the board of directors and management attempt to manage the Company's interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins. At times, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the board of directors and management may decide to increase the Company's interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin. The Company's results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates. One method used to quantify interest rate risk is a short-term earnings at risk summary, which is a detailed and dynamic simulation model used to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes. This simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates net interest income exposure annually over a five-year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth, no balance sheet mix change, and various interest rate scenarios including no change in rates; 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis point upward and downward shifts; where interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date. The model assumes parallel and pro rata shifts in interest rates over a twelve-month period for the 100, 200 and 300 basis point upward and downward shifts. For the 400 basis point upward shift, the model assumes a parallel and pro rata shift in interest rates over a twenty-four month period. Further, in recent years, the Company added additional interest rate scenarios where interest rates experience a parallel and instantaneous shift (a shock upward and downward of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points. The Company will run additional interest rate scenarios on an as-needed basis. The asset/liability management committees of the subsidiary bank boards of directors have established policy limits of a 10 decline in net interest income for the 200-basis point upward and downward parallel shift. For the 300 basis point upward and downward shock, the established policy limit is a 30 decline in net interest income. The increased policy limit is appropriate as the shock scenario is extreme and unlikely and warrants a higher limit than the more realistic and traditional parallel/pro-rata shift scenarios. 

 67 

Table of Contents 
 Part I Item 3 Application of the simulation model analysis for select interest rate scenarios at the most recent quarter-end available is presented in the following table: 

NET INTEREST INCOME EXPOSURE in YEAR 1 As of September 30, As of December 31, INTEREST RATE SCENARIO POLICY LIMIT 2024 2023 300 basis point downward parallel shock (30.0) 3.0 2.1 200 basis point downward parallel shift (10.0) 1.7 1.4 200 basis point upward parallel shift (10.0) (2.6) (2.3) 300 basis point upward parallel shock (30.0) (7.9) (8.0) With the shift in funding from non-interest bearing and lower beta deposits to higher beta deposits, the Company s balance sheet is now moderately liability sensitive. Notably, management is conservative with the repricing assumptions on loans and deposits. For example, management does not model any delay in loan and deposit betas despite historical experience and practice of delays in deposit betas. Additionally, management does not model mix shift or growth in its standard scenarios which can be impactful. As an alternative, management runs separate scenarios to capture the impact on delayed beta performance and various shifts in mix of loans and deposits. Finally, management models a variety of scenarios including some that stress key assumptions to help capture and isolate the impact of the management s more conservative approach to the assumptions in the base model. The simulation is within the board-established policy limits for all four scenarios. Additionally, for all of the various interest rate scenarios modeled and measured by management (as described above), the results at September 30, 2024 were within established risk tolerances as established by policy or by best practice (if the interest rate scenario didn't have a specific policy limit). Interest rate risk is considered to be one of the most significant market risks affecting the Company. For that reason, the Company engages the assistance of a national consulting firm and its risk management system to monitor and control the Company's interest rate risk exposure. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in the normal course of the Company's business activities.
