 million and a retained deficit of million. Without ongoing income generation or additional financing, the Company will be unable to fund general and administrative expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months from the date of the filing of this 10Q. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is evaluating financing its future requirements through a combination of debt, equity and/or other facilities. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such financing or obtain them on favorable terms. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and statement of financial position classifications that would be necessary were the going concern assumption deemed to be inappropriate. These adjustments could be material.

million from the loan. The terms of the promissory note (the "Note") issued in connection with Loan include: a maturity date of months from the date of issuance (the Maturity Date and the principal amount of the Note, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, will be payable on the Maturity Date; 

 the Note bears interest at the rate of per annum, accruing monthly and payable on the Maturity Date; 

 the principal amount of the Note will be advanced in two tranches of million each. The first tranche was advanced within one business day and the second tranche will be advanced after the Company delivers a draw down notice, but subject to the lender receiving internal approval for the second tranche; and 

 the Note is unsecured, is not convertible and provides for no warrants. 

 This loan was paid off in connection with the new million secured notes closed on August 2, 2023 and the outstanding balance related to debt costs and discounts of approximately thousand was written off. On August 2, 2023, the Company closed the placement of million senior secured notes due 2029. The proceeds from these notes were used to pay-off the pre-existing Loan and Subscription Agreement. The terms of the senior secure notes include: a term of years and maturity date of with principal payments due until maturity date; 

 the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum and include an upfront fee of of the principal payment; 

 the Company is permitted to prepay all (but not less than all) of the notes beginning on July 1, 2025 subject to a redemption premium of (i) of the principal to be redeemed on or prior to August 2, 2026, (ii) of the principal to be redeemed after August 2, 2026 or on or prior to August 2, 2027, (iii) of the principal to be redeemed after August 2, 2027 or on or prior to August 2, 2028, (iv) of the principal to be redeemed after August 2, 2028;

 o minimum adjusted EBITDA of (i) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, (ii) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and (iii) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025; 

 o minimum liquidity of million measured at each quarter end; 

 collateralized by substantially of all the Company's assets. 

 The Company determined that the terms of the warrants issued in the financing require the warrants to be classified as equity. Accordingly, upon issuance, the Company recorded debt issuance costs of million related to the warrants along with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital. As the warrants are classified as equity warrants the Company will not remeasure the warrants each accounting period. Since the warrants may purchase a fixed number of shares for a fixed price, the Company chose to use the Monte Carlo option pricing model to value the warrants at issuance. The inputs selected are: underlying stock price at date of issuance of per share, exercise price of per share, expected term of years, dividends of , a risk free rate of , and volatility of . The debt issuance costs resulting from the warrants along with other direct costs of the financing will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. On December 21, 2023, the Company and the senior secured notes due 2029 purchasers amended the original placement of million senior secured notes due 2029 for the sale of an additional million senior secured notes due 2029 to original purchasers and the total warrants increased by warrants with an exercise price of US per warrant. The net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes will be used to repurchase million principal amount of senior secure notes due 2029 from an original purchaser plus payment

Business Overview 
 
 GlobalX operates a US Part 121 domestic flag and supplemental airline using the Airbus A320 family of aircraft, operating both passenger and cargo aircraft. GlobalX s business model is to (1) provide services on an ACMI using wet lease contracts to airlines and non-airlines, and (2) on a Charter basis whereby we provide passenger aircraft charter services to customers by charging an all-in fee that includes fuel, insurance, landing fees, navigation fees and most other operational fees and costs. GlobalX operates in the United States, Europe, Canada, Central and South America. 
 
 Business Strategy 
 
 GlobalX intends to become the best-in-class U.S. narrow-body, ACMI charter airline, operating both passenger and cargo charter aircraft while recruiting and maintaining a dynamic team of customer-centric flight crews, ground and maintenance teams and management staff. 
 
 GlobalX operates its A320 family aircraft for airlines, tour operators, college and professional sports teams, incentive groups, resorts and casino groups and government agencies. It is our goal to deliver best in class on time performance and dispatch reliability, expand existing relationships and develop additional relationships with leading charter/tour operators to provide aircraft during their peak seasons; and provide ad-hoc and track charter programs for non-airline customers. 

19 

Business Developments 
 
 During the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, the Company refocused the business back to GlobalX s core competency operating narrow body charter flights for both passengers and cargo. This led to the cancellation of several initiatives and the prioritization of adding aircraft to our operating certificate. Projects cancelled, include UrbanX, GlobalX Colombia, GlobalX Ecuador, adding ETOP s capability, the acquisition of a wide body A330 aircraft and the development of a hangar facility at Fort Lauderdale Airport. Not only does the cancellation of these projects represent significant cash savings in 2024, but it also allows the team to devote efforts towards our stated goal: creating the largest narrow body charter operation in North America generating sustainable, long-term profits. To achieve this goal, GlobalX continues to invest in its three key assets certifications, aircraft, and crew. 
 
 GlobalX achieved the following during the nine months period ended September 30, 2024: 
 Department of Transportation granted us economic authority to operate 20 aircraft, an increase from 16 

Took delivery of two A320 passenger aircraft and one A321F. 

Completed five heavy maintenance events and 12 non-heavy maintenance events. 

Hired and trained over 70 people in dispatch, crew scheduling, operation control center and maintenance, people required to operate the volume of flights anticipated over the remainder of 2024. 

Slightly increase pilot headcount from 134 to 136. 

Operated our first flight for the Department of Defense, a key customer representing an important milestone for GlobalX. 

Due to increasingly high demand in 2024, GlobalX also contracted over 1,200 block hours on other carriers to fulfill our customers missions. 

The Passenger Charter Market 
 
 The passenger market continues to experience surging demand resulting in improved aircraft utilization and improved operating income. There are several factors, including the supply of aircraft, reduced direct competition, increased reliance on air charter by colleges and increased customer demand driving increased demand for our services. GlobalX anticipates the high level of demand will continue well into 2025. To address this demand, the Company has prioritized passenger aircraft deliveries over cargo, devoted sales and operational resources to develop long term relationships with key customers and to expand the markets served as opportunities arise. Passenger charter services will be the economic engine for GlobalX in 2024. 
 
 The Cargo Charter Market 
 
 GlobalX believes in the longer term viability of the A321F (passenger to freighter) cargo aircraft. During Q1 2024, we had two aircraft offline, one for maintenance and, one for conformity. This left two operational aircraft, both of which generated lower than anticipated revenue. GlobalX attributed the softness of the market to several external factors including the rebid of the USPS contract, general economic conditions, and excess capacity in the North American freight market. In response to this slowdown during the quarter, the Company cancelled two aircraft deliveries, elected to take two A321 s as passenger rather than freighter and deferred two other cargo deliveries to 2025. GlobalX is working diligently to place the aircraft we have into long term ACMI contracts and continues to make progress establishing our reputation for on-time performance as the market better understands the capabilities of the A321F aircraft. While the Company cannot predict when the cargo market will recover, GlobalX has taken concrete steps to reduce our financial exposure in 2024 while expanding our customer base for the aircraft the Company does have. 
 
 GlobalX Aircraft Fleet 
 
 Critical to GlobalX s business model is, a fleet of modern and cost-effective aircraft. To achieve this objective, GlobalX has selected what it believes is the best overall single-aisle aircraft family to operate. This approach differs from traditional airlines, which purchase a variety of aircraft, often from different manufacturers, to achieve their operational flight sectors, resulting in increased training, operating and spare part costs. GlobalX conducted research to determine the best aircraft to fly in competition with other narrow-body charter airlines in the single-aisle seat market and GlobalX selected the A320 aircraft family. 
 
 The following factors support GlobalX s choice to operate the Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft versus the Boeing family of aircraft: 
 
 Cost and Operating factors: lower fuel burn, and better aircraft and cockpit crew pool availability. 
 
 Operational Capability: the A320 has a range advantage over the 737-800 and can fly non-stop from Miami to selected airports in North America, South America, the Caribbean, and between most major destinations in Europe. The A320 has excellent maintenance dispatch 
 20 

reliability and strong availability of spare parts and components, making the A320, in management s estimation, the most popular aircraft among low-cost airlines. 
 
 Passenger comfort: better seat width, cargo bin volume for carry-on baggage and cargo hold volume. 
 
 Aircraft Maintenance 
 
 Heavy maintenance checks are expected to continue to be outsourced to FAA-approved service providers. The 6Y and 12Y checks will be primarily paid for using funds from the accrued maintenance reserves paid to lessors under operating leases. 
 
 Strategy to Address Competitive Response 
 
 There have been significant changes to the competitive environment for US Charter operators in recent months. The liquidation of iAero (our largest competitor), the acquisition of Hillwood Airways by Eastern Airlines, the acquisition of iAero Assets by Eastern Airlines and Breeze Airways renewed focus on charter operations have all had a large impact on the charter market. It is our management's expectation that Eastern Airlines, with the assets acquired from iAero, will look to expand their business domestically. In response we are focusing on our core business, emphasizing on time performance, reinforcing our differentiation of our Airbus product and actively soliciting longer-term contracts with key customers. 
 
 Experienced management team 
 
 Our management team has extensive operating and leadership experience in the airfreight, airline, and aircraft leasing, maintenance, and management industries at companies such as JetBlue Airways, Virgin America, American Airlines, US Airways, Atlas Air, Breeze Airways, Miami Air, Spirit Airlines, Continental Airlines, Pan Am, and Flair Airlines, as well as the United States Army, and Air Force. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and other financial information appearing and referred to elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Revenue Statistics 
 
 The analysis of GlobalX results for the three and nine-month periods ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023 requires an understanding of how the Company fundamentally evolved during that time period. 2023 was only our second year of full operations and was a period where the company was focused on securing new customers, entering new markets, and flying to new locations; primarily in the domestic and Caribbean markets. 
 
 By contrast in 2024, GlobalX is expanding on our existing relationships both domestically and internationally and grew operations in the ACMI market through increased focus on operating for government agencies. As the company grows, operational efficiency and margins are continuing to improve. Our key metric is block hours flown and block hours flown per available aircraft, which is the measure by which the Company tracks commercial activity. While other airlines discuss available seat miles and revenue per available seat mile rasm ), cost per available seat mile casm ), these metrics are not germane to our business model as an ACMI and Charter operator. GlobalX charters the entire aircraft, does not take fuel risk, and does not take third party risk therefore all results are evaluated on a block hour basis.

Q3 saw a significant shift in the mix of our business from Charter to ACMI. Charter revenue for the period decreased 6.8 million or 31.3 , from 21.8 million in 2023 to 15.0 million in 2024. Charter block hours decreased 44.4 from 2,256 to 1,254 resulting in a 9.7 million reduction which was primarily offset by the rate for Charter flying which increased 23.6 from 9,672 per block hour to 11,951 per block hour resulting in a 2.9 million impact. The increase in the rate per block hour is primarily driven by high market demand and a shortage of supply as competitors reduced capacity to increase demand, higher fuel and handling fees and the mix of flying. The decrease in charter block hours was due to the increase in the number of aircraft in the ACMI segment. 
 
 ACMI revenue for the period increased by 17.7 million or 92.9 from 19.1 million in 2023 to 36.8 million in 2024. This variance is primarily driven by a 40.7 increase in the number of available aircraft and the movement of aircraft from the Charter segment which resulted in an increase from 4,615 block hours in 2023 to 6,571 block hours in 2024, an increase of 42.4 or 1,956 block hours. This volume accounted for 45.8 or 8.1 million of the revenue increase. The average revenue per block hour increased 1,468 per block hour from 4,139 per block hour in 2023 to 5,607 per block hour in 2024 and accounted for 9.6 million or 54.2 of the revenue increase. The primary driver for the increase was related to both high market demand and a shortage of supply as competitors reduce capacity. 
 
 Other revenue for the period decreased by 1.0 million from 1.7 million in 2023 to 0.6 million in 2024. The decrease is primarily driven by less ancillary services provided to our customers.

Salaries, wages, and benefits increased 2.4 million from 15.0 million to 17.4 million, or 15.7 , primarily due to the hiring and training of pilots and other airline personnel necessitated by the growing fleet and operations. The total employees grew 15.0 from 585 to 688 and pilots increased from 121 to 143, or 18.2 . 
 
 Aircraft fuel decreased by 1.6 million, from 5.7 million to 4.1 million, or 28.5 , primarily due to the volume of non-ACMI block hours which decreased 34.0 or 2.0 million. This was partially offset by an increase in fuel prices by 5.4 . 
 
 Maintenance, materials, and repairs increased by 0.5 million, from 3.0 million to 3.4 million, or 15.6 . An increase of 0.6 million was due to severe weather event that damaged two parked aircraft, multiple bird strikes and damage caused by a third-party vendor, which was offset by 0.2 million decrease primarily due to decreased ad hoc work in spite of the increase in both the number of aircraft and the number of block hours flown which increased 954 or 15 from 6,506 to 7,460 block hours. The rate per block hour remained relatively unchanged at 462 per block hour. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 1.3 million, from 0.6 million to 1.9 million or 229.7 , driven by assets acquired to support our airport operations. These assets include, but are not limited to, aircraft deliveries secured on capital leases, computers, software, and rotable inventory. 
 
 Contracted ground and aviation services decreased by 1.4 million from 4.7 million to 3.3 million, or 30.1 . These costs are directly correlated to the number of Charter hours operated. A 2.7 million reduction was primarily driven by the decrease in charter block hours by 56.6 . This was offset by 1.2 million primarily due to an increase in rate by 61.0 . 
 
 Travel increased by 0.6 million, from 1.6 million to 2.2 million or 42.6 . This increase was driven by increased activity at newly created bases to support new customers resulting in additional hotel, flight and meal costs. 
 
 Insurance increased 0.4 million, from 1.2 million to 1.6 million or 33.5 , primarily related to the increase in the number of aircraft. 
 
 Aircraft rent increased 6.6 million, from 9.4 million to 16.0 million or 70.5 , primarily due to the increase in the number of aircraft from 12 to 18 aircraft in the fleet. 4.2 million or 63.6 of the increase is driven by the increase in the number of aircraft being leased, with the remaining 2.4 million or 36.4 due to rate increase per aircraft and short-term ACMI leases from other airlines due to flights sold exceeded capacity available during the period. 
 
 Operating loss was greatly impacted by a series of unplanned maintenance events in September that effectively took almost 35 of the passenger fleet offline for almost two weeks. This included a severe weather event damaging two parked aircraft, multiple bird strikes across three different aircraft and a third-party vendor who severely damaged an aircraft during a routine check. A number of these are insurable events, but the impact to revenue was significant and the estimated impact to operating loss is over 5M. In addition, our Cargo segment continued to underperform which also served as a multimillion dollar drag to earnings in Q3. Specifically, operating loss increased 0.2 million, from an operating loss of 2.3 million to an operating loss in 2023 of 2.5 million. We were able to minimize the impacts of the events in September by our ability to secure higher rates for both ACMI and Charter contracts. The Company s ACMI rate grew 35.4 , from 4,139 per block hour to 5,607 per block hour, while Charter rate per block hour is up 23.6 from 9,672 per block hour to 11,951 per block hour. The second factor is scale. As an example, when measured on

a per block hour basis, Salaries, wages, and benefits dropped from 2,183 to 2,158 per block hour, a 1.1 reduction. There were also savings on a per block hour basis on fuel, and contracted ground and aviation services.

Charter revenue for the period decreased 0.1 million or 0.2 , from 73.7 million in 2023 to 73.6 million in 2024. The rate for Charter flying increased 15.7 from 11,084 per block hour to 12,821 per block hour resulting in a 10.0 million increase. This was offset by a 10.1 million reduction due to charter block hours decreasing 13.7 from 6,652 to 5,742 block hours. The increase in the rate per block hour is primarily driven by high market demand and a shortage of supply as competitors reduced capacity to increase demand, higher fuel and handling fees and the mix of flying. The decrease in charter block hours was due to the increase in the number of aircraft in the ACMI segment. 
 
 ACMI revenue for the period increased by 58.8 million or 205.9 from 28.6 million in 2023 to 87.4 million in 2024. This variance is driven by an increase from 7,146 block hours in 2023 to 14,775 block hours in 2024, an increase of 106.8 or 7,629 block hours. This volume accounted for 51.9 or 30.5 million of the increase. The average revenue per block hour increased 1,916 per block hours from 3,997 per block hour in 2023 to 5,914 per block hour in 2024 and accounted for 28.3 million or 48.1 of the revenue increase. The primary driver for the increase was related to both high market demand and a shortage of supply as competitors reduce capacity. 
 
 Other revenue for the period decreased by 1.1 million from 3.9 million in 2023 to 2.8 million in 2024. The decrease is primarily driven by less ancillary services provided to our customers.

Salaries, wages, and benefits increased 12.7 million from 38.3 million to 50.9 million, or 33.1 , primarily due to the hiring and training of pilots and other airline personnel necessitated by the growing fleet and operations. The total employees grew 15.0 from 585 to 688 and pilots increased from 121 to 143, or 18.2 . A block hour increase of 52.2 drove a 19.3 million increase, offset by 6.6 million due to a reduction in rate per block hour of 11.5 . 
 
 Aircraft fuel decreased by 9.5 by 1.9 million, the volume of non-ACMI block hours decreased by 16.2 or 3.2 million. This was offset by an increase in base jet fuel of approximately 8.0 or 1.3 million. 
 
 Maintenance, materials, and repairs increased by 2.7 million, from 6.3 million to 9.0 million, or 43.1 . An increase of 0.6 million was due to a severe weather event that damaged two parked aircraft, multiple bird strikes across several aircraft and damage caused by a third-party vendor, which was offset by a 0.2 million decrease primarily due to decreased ad hoc work in spite of the increase in both the number of aircraft and the number of block hours flown which increased 954 or 15 from 6,506 to 7,460 block hours. Another 2.3 million cost increase was primarily due to volume from the increase in both the number of aircraft to 18 and the number of block hours flown which increased 45.5 from 13,235 to 19,252 block hours. This was offset by 0.2 million due to the rate per block hour improvement of 1.6 from 477 per block hour to 469 per block hour. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 3.0 million, from 1.5 million to 4.5 million or 208.3 , driven by assets acquired to support our airport operations. These assets include, but are not limited to, aircraft deliveries secured on capital leases, computers, software, and rotable inventory. 
 
 Contracted ground and aviation services increased by 0.2 million from 14.7 million to 14.9 million, or 1.3 . A rate increase or 34.5 per block hour drove an increase of 3.8 million. This was mostly offset by lower charter block hours by 24.7 , which drove a reduction of 3.6 million. 
 
 Travel increased 4.0 million, from 5.2 million to 9.2 million or 78.2 , 2.3 million was driven by the 45.5 increase in block hours. The remaining 1.7 million variance is driven rate increase by 22.5 , caused by higher flying at outstations, thus raising hotel and meal cost for crews on missions. 
 
 Insurance increased 1.2 million, from 3.6 million to 4.8 million or 34.2 , primarily related to the increase in the number of aircraft. 
 
 Aircraft rent increased 21.7 million, from 21.9 million to 43.6 million or 99.1 , primarily due to the increase in the number of aircraft from 10 to 18 aircraft in the fleet. 11.2 million or 51.9 of the increase is driven by the increase in the number of aircraft being leased, with the remaining 10.4 million or 48.1 due to rate increase per aircraft and short-term ACMI leases from other airlines due to flights sold exceeded capacity available during the period. 
 
 Operating loss decreased 10.0 million, from an operating loss of 14.6 million to 4.6 million, or 68.7 improvement. In addition, operating loss as a percentage of revenue improved from (13.8 to (2.8 ), an 11.0 improvement. This was a direct result of GlobalX s ability to grow its revenue faster than its cost structure as the airline works towards achieving scale and profitability. There are a few factors driving the improved margins. The first factor is rates as the Company was able to secure higher rates for both ACMI and Charter contracts. The Company s ACMI rate grew 47.8 , from 4,001 per block hour to 5,914 per block hour, while Charter rate per block hour is up 30.5 from 9,822 per block hour to 12,821 per block hour. The second factor is scale. As an example, when measured on a per block hour basis, Salaries, wages, and benefits dropped from 1,384 to 1,224 per block hour, an 11.5 reduction. There were also savings on a per block hour basis in fuel, Maintenance, insurance, and general overhead expenses (other) which combined with the other factors drove the improvement. This improvement was, in spite of the impact of the events in September, that effectively took almost 35 of the passenger fleet offline for almost two weeks. This included a severe weather event damaging two parked aircraft, multiple bird strikes across three different aircraft and a third-party vendor who severely damaged an aircraft during a routine check. A number of these are insurable events, but the impact to revenue was significant and the estimated impact to operating loss is over 5M. In addition, our Cargo segment continued to underperform which also served as a multimillion dollar drag to earnings in Q3.

 Net Loss 
 
 Net Loss due to events noted above, decreased by 7.4 million or 40.4 , from a net loss of 18.4 million in 2023 to 11.0 million in 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 7.1 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately 0.8 million in restricted cash, a decrease of approximately 4.5 million and 5.3 million from December 31, 2023, respectively primarily due to new aircraft deliveries, deposits, and net loss in operations. Management is confident that the augmented cash and cash equivalents, coupled with the anticipated rise in sales linked to the Company s strategies to attract more funds, will adequately address the Company s liquidity requirements. Management is actively assessing various options to procure additional funds, including exploring opportunities for additional equity or debt financing. 
 
 Net Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.5 million to 2.3 million, consisting primarily of 5.3 million of increase in accounts payable, 3.4 million of decrease in accounts receivable, 0.1 million of decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, 15.5 million in noncash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, operating lease right of use assets and debt issue costs, 2.0 million of interest on finance leases, 1.3 million of share-based payments, 0.4 million of bad debt expense and 0.2 million of loss on sale of spare parts. These were partially offset by 10.5 million of decrease in operating leases obligations, 8.6 million of decrease in accrued liabilities and other liabilities, 11.0 million of net loss and 0.4 million of increase in assets held for sale. Net Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.8 million, consisting primarily of 18.4 million of net loss, 6.2 million of increase of operating lease obligations, 4.9 million of increase of accounts receivable, 1.2 million of increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 0.2 million of gain on sale of spare parts. These were partially offset by 8.9 million of increase of accrued liabilities and other liabilities, 3.6 million of increase in accounts payable and 8.9 million in noncash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, operating lease right of use assets and debt issue costs, 1.7 million of share-based payments, 0.3 million of interest on finance leases, and 0.1 million of loss on sale of property. 
 
 The Company has significant fixed and non-cancelable lease commitments of aircraft, equipment and related maintenance checks. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total of 19.5 million due in the next 12 months of future minimum lease payments under finance and operating leases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total of 105.3 million due after 12 months from the balance sheet date of future minimum lease payments under finance and operating leases, and 29.5 million in notes payable included in the non-current liabilities presented in the Company s consolidated balance sheet. The Company ended September 30, 2024 with fourteen passenger aircraft and four cargo aircraft and expects the fleet to increase to 15 and 17 passenger aircraft and maintain four cargo aircraft by the end of 2024 and 2025, respectively. To achieve the number of aircraft deliveries in 2024 and 2025, the Company currently has seven aircrafts under lease with partial or total deposit paid. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used for investing activities decreased 1.5 million to 6.3 million, consisting of 5.0 million of Purchases of property and equipment and 1.3 million of increase of deposit, deferred costs and other assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used for investing activities was 7.8 million, consisting of 5.7 million increase of deposit, deferred costs and other assets and 2.1 million of Purchases of property and equipment. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities increased 27.7 million to 1.3 million, consisting of 1.4 million of Principal payments on finance leases and 0.1 million of Dividends, partially offset by Proceeds on issuance of shares of 0.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 26.4 million, consisting of 32.1 million of Proceeds from note payable, 1.6 million of Proceeds on issuance of shares, partially offset by 7.0 million of Repayment of note payable and 0.3 million of Principal payments on finance leases. 
 
 The Company continuously seeks to identify external sources of capital from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessment of current and anticipated market conditions, and the after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be adversely impacted by prevailing economic conditions and by financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 27 

Additionally, the Company s borrowing costs are affected by market conditions and may be adversely impacted by a tightening in credit markets. 
 
 The Company regularly assesses our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements and future investments or acquisitions to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. The Company also regularly evaluates its liquidity and capital structure to ensure financial risks, adequate liquidity access and lower cost of capital are efficiently managed. 
 
 Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4 Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our Executive Chairman and President Chief Financial Officer, referred to collectively herein as the Certifying Officers, are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Executive Chairman and the President Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Certifying Officers have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 240.13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Our Executive Chairman and President Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 1. Insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

Remediation Plans 
 
 In order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, the Company plans to take steps to develop and enhance its internal controls over financial reporting in the remainder of 2024, including: 
 1. Developing formal policies and procedures over accounting and reporting disclosure requirements. 

2. Provide additional training on application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

3. Obtain checklists to ensure all application disclosures required under US GAAP and SEC requirements are included in each filing. 

As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, Certifying officers and management may determine that additional measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. Therefore, we cannot assure you when the Company will remediate the material weakness identified above, nor can we be certain that additional actions will not be required and what the costs of any such additional actions may be. Moreover, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting, we believe that the consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s consolidated financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity GAAP. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
