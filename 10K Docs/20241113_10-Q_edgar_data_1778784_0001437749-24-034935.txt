million, of which million was outstanding as of that date; and 
 
 Our securities portfolio represented of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and the accumulated other comprehensive loss on the portfolio was million, or of shareholders equity as of that date. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these debt security holdings are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality. Based on our ability to borrow, cash position and low deposit outflows there is no expected reliance on security sales to meet operational needs. 

4 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023 - 09 ), to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023 - 09 requires annual disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation table and separate disclosure for reconciling items that exceed a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023 - 09 also requires annual disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, and separately, the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by individual taxing jurisdictions in which income taxes paid exceed a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023 - 09 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this Accounting Standard Update with respect to its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2023 - 07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280 - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023 - 07 ), to improve a public entity s disclosures surrounding reportable segments. ASU 2023 - 07 requires public entities to: disclose significant segment expenses, on an annual and interim basis, that are provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), disclose an amount for other segment items by reportable segment including a description of its composition, disclose all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, and disclose the title and position of the CODM. The amendments in ASU 2023 - 07 are applicable to companies with a single reportable segment. The amended disclosures from ASU 2023 - 07 will be incorporated in the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10 -K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Interest income includes amortization of purchase premium or discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are generally amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Premiums on callable debt securities are amortized to their earliest call date. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method. 
 
 There were realized gains or losses on sales and calls of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Securities with carrying amounts of 7.2 million and million were pledged to secure available borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The scheduled maturities of debt securities at September 30, 2024 are summarized in the table below. Actual maturities of asset and mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities because the assets and mortgages underlying the securities may be repaid without any penalties. Because asset- and mortgage-backed securities are not due at a single maturity date, they are not included in the maturity categories in the following maturity summary: 

Due after five years through ten years 
 Due after ten years 
 Government mortgage-backed securities 
 Asset-backed securities 

At the time a debt security is placed on non-accrual status, generally when any principal or interest payments become 90 days or more delinquent or if full collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income. There were no debt securities on non-accrual status and therefore there was no accrued interest related to debt securities reversed against interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023 . 
 
 The aggregate fair value and unrealized losses of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and for twelve months or longer are as follows at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 : 

Asset-backed securities

The Company expects to recover its amortized cost basis on all debt securities. Furthermore, the Company does not intend to sell nor does it anticipate that it will be required to sell these securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 , prior to this recovery. The Company s ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery is supported by the Company strong capital and liquidity positions as well as its historically low portfolio turnover. 
 
 As a result of the analysis below, by investment type, we determined that no allowance for credit loss for investment securities was required as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 State and municipal securities: At September 30, 2024 , of the securities in the Company s portfolio of state and municipal securities were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of state and municipal securities in unrealized loss positions. The Company continually monitors the state and municipal securities sector of the market carefully and periodically evaluates the appropriate level of exposure to the market. At this time, the Company feels the securities in this portfolio carry minimal risk of default and the Company is appropriately compensated for that risk. There were no material underlying downgrades during the quarter. All securities are performing. 
 
 Asset-backed securities: At September 30, 2024 , four of the five securities in the Company s portfolio of asset-backed securities were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of asset-backed securities in unrealized loss positions. The U.S. Small Business Administration guarantees the contractual cash flows of all of the Company s asset-backed securities. The securities are investment grade rated and there were no material underlying credit downgrades during the quarter. All securities are performing. 
 
 Government mortgage-backed securities: At September 30, 2024 , all of the securities in the Company s portfolio of government mortgage-backed securities were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of government mortgage-backed securities in unrealized loss positions. The Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association guarantee the contractual cash flows of all of the Company s mortgage-backed securities. The securities are investment grade rated and there were no material underlying credit downgrades during the quarter. All securities are performing. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Available-For-Sale Securities: 
 
 For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. For debt securities available-for-sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income. 
 
 Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as credit loss expense (or reversal). Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes an available for sale security is uncollectible, or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. 
 
 Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and was included in accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

 Total loans 
 Allowance for credit losses on loans 
 Net loans 

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at amortized cost net of the allowance for credit losses for loans. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts and deferred loan fees and costs. Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and was included in accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Interest income is accrued on unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using either the level-yield or straight-line method without anticipating prepayments. 
 
 At the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status, generally at 90 days past due, or earlier if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful, all interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for a return to accrual status. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans: 
 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans ACLL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the un-collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance and do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off. The Company employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACLL that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The methodology for evaluating quantitative factors involves pooling loans into portfolio segments for loans that share similar risk characteristics. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: 
 
 Commercial real estate : Loans in this segment are primarily income-producing properties throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties can be adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates, which in turn, can have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Management periodically obtains rent rolls and continually monitors the cash flows of these loans. 
 
 Construction and land development : Loans in this segment primarily include speculative and pre-sold real estate development loans for which payment is derived from sale of the property and a conversion of the construction loans to permanent loans for which payment is then derived from cash flows of the property. Credit risk is affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, inaccurate estimates of the value of the completed project, and market conditions. 
 
 Residential real estate : All loans in this segment are collateralized by owner-occupied residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will effect the credit quality in this segment. We no longer originate residential real estate loans, and previously we did not typically originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 or grant subprime loans. Loans with loan to value ratios greater than 80 required the purchase of private mortgage insurance. 
 
 Mortgage warehouse : Loans in this segment are primarily facility lines to non-bank mortgage origination companies. The underlying collateral of these loans are residential real estate loans. Loans are originated by the mortgage companies for sale into secondary markets, which is typically within 15 days of the loan closing. The primary source of repayment is the cash flows upon the sale of the loans. The credit risk associated with this type of lending is the risk that the mortgage companies are unable to sell the loans. 
 
 Commercial : Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, can have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 
 
 Enterprise value: Loans in this segment are made to small- and medium-size businesses in a senior secure position and are generally secured by the enterprise value of the business. The enterprise value consists of the going concern value of the business and takes into account the value of business assets (both tangible and intangible). Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. Economic and industry specific conditions can effect the credit quality of this segment. 
 
 Digital asset : We no longer originate or hold digital asset loans. Loans in this segment were made to businesses in the digital asset space and were generally secured by digital asset mining equipment or by the United States dollar value of digital currency assets of the business. 
 
 Consumer : Loans in this segment are generally unsecured and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. 

Management estimates the ACLL balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Generally, management considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to four quarters and then utilizes a four -quarter straight-line reversion period. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as portfolio mix, delinquency levels, or term as well as for changes in economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, gross domestic product GDP ), home pricing index HPI ), or other relevant factors. Incorporated in the estimate for the ACLL is consideration of qualitative factors, which include the following for all loan pools: 
 
 Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collections, charge offs, and recovery practices; 
 
 Changes in the experience, depth, and ability of lending management; 
 
 Changes in the quality of the organization's loan review system; 
 
 The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the levels of such concentrations; and 
 
 The effect of other external factors (i.e. legal and regulatory requirements) on the level of estimated credit losses. 

In addition to the above, the mortgage warehouse pool includes a qualitative factor for changes in international, national, regional, and local conditions as the ACLL model for this loan pool does not apply an economic regression model in the calculation of the historical loss rate. The determination of qualitative factors involves significant judgment. 
 
 The allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained by the Company at a level determined to be sufficient to absorb expected lifetime losses related to unfunded credit facilities (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit). 
 
 The Company measures the ACLL using the following methods: 
 
 Portfolio Segment Measurement Method Loss Driver 
 Commercial real estate Discounted cash flow National unemployment rate, national GDP 
 Construction and land development Discounted cash flow National unemployment rate, national GDP 
 Residential real estate Discounted cash flow National unemployment rate, national HPI 
 Mortgage warehouse Remaining life method Not applicable 
 Commercial Discounted cash flow National unemployment rate, national GDP 
 Enterprise value Discounted cash flow National unemployment rate, national GDP 
 Digital asset Discounted cash flow National unemployment rate, national GDP 
 Consumer Discounted cash flow National unemployment rate, national GDP 

When the discounted cash flow method is used to determine the allowance for credit losses, management adjusts the effective interest rate used to discount expected cash flows to incorporate expected prepayments. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. 
 
 When the remaining life method is used to determine the allowance for credit losses, a calculated loss rate is applied to the pool of loans based on the remaining life expectation of the pool. The remaining life expectation is based on management s reasonable expectation at the reporting date. 
 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics, whether or not they are performing in accordance with their loan terms, are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation. The Company will individually evaluate a loan when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in making this determination include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not considered reason enough to individually analyze a loan. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. When management determines that a loan should be individually analyzed, expected credit losses are based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs, as appropriate.

Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing the following modifications: principal forgiveness, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions, interest rate reductions, or a combination of these modifications. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses on loans. 
 
 In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted.

 Credit Quality Information 
 
 The Company utilizes a seven -grade internal loan risk rating system for commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial, and enterprise value loans as follows: 
 
 Loans rated 1 - 3 : Loans in these categories are considered pass rated loans with low to average risk. 
 
 Loans rated 4 : Loans in this category are considered special mention. These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management. 
 
 Loans rated 5 : Loans in this category are considered substandard. Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected. 
 
 Loans rated 6 : Loans in this category are considered doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Loans rated 7 : Loans in this category are considered uncollectible loss and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted. 
 
 On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial, and enterprise value loans. 

On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company completes a credit recertification on all mortgage warehouse originators. 
 
 For residential real estate loans, the Company initially assesses credit quality based upon the borrower s ability to pay and rates such loans as pass. Ongoing monitoring is based upon the borrower s payment activity. 
 
 Consumer loans are not formally rated.

Fair Values of Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 
 The Company may also be required, from time to time, to measure certain other assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
 
 Certain loans were adjusted to fair value, less cost to sell, of the underlying collateral securing these loans resulting in losses. The loss is not recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings, but rather as a component in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans. Fair value was measured using appraised values of collateral and adjusted as necessary by management based on unobservable inputs for specific properties. 

The following summarizes assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 :

Liquidation Accounts 
 
 Upon the completion of the Company s initial stock offering in 2015 and the second step offering in 2019, liquidation accounts were established for the benefit of certain depositors of the Bank in amounts equal to: 
 1. The product of (i) the percentage of the stock issued in the initial stock offering in 2015 to persons other than Provident Bancorp, the top tier mutual holding company MHC of the Company and (ii) the net worth of the mid-tier holding company as of the date of the latest balance sheet contained in the prospectus utilized in connection with the offering; and 
 
 2. The MHC s ownership interest in the retained earnings of the Company as of the date of the latest balance sheet contained in the 2019 prospectus plus the MHC s net assets (excluding its ownership of the Company). 

The Company and the Bank are not permitted to pay dividends on their capital stock if the shareholders equity of the Company, or the shareholder s equity of the Bank, would be reduced below the amount of the respective liquidation accounts. The liquidation accounts will be reduced annually to the extent that eligible account holders have reduced their qualifying deposits. Subsequent increases will not restore an eligible account holder s interest in the liquidation accounts. 
 
 Other Restrictions 
 
 The Company s principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Federal and state banking regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank in a year, without prior approval of regulatory agencies, to the amount by which net income of the Bank for the year plus the retained net income of the previous two years exceeds any net loss reported in those respective periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Bank reported net income of million.

The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures of awards as they occur. 
 
 Expense related to options and restricted stock granted to directors is recognized in directors compensation within non-interest expense. 
 
 Stock Options 
 
 The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: 
 
 Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s common stock price; 
 
 Expected life represents the period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding, taking into account the contractual term, and the vesting period; 
 
 The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company s expectation of dividend payouts; and 
 
 The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period equivalent to the expected life of the option. 

The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of grant date: 

Expiration date (years) 
 Expected volatility 
 Expected life (years) 
 Expected dividend yield 
 Risk free interest rate

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Critical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy, which involves the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, is as follows: 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans. The allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loan balance is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. See Note 6 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Balance Sheet Analysis 
 
 The Bank has adjusted its risk appetite to reduce the overall risk profile of the balance sheet by limiting asset growth to five percent annually and transforming the mix of the loan portfolio towards traditional real estate and in-market commercial lending, while decreasing our exposure to enterprise value lending and eliminating our digital asset portfolio. This quarter, the Bank recognized an additional 1.7 million reserve on a 17.6 million enterprise value relationship, which now carries a total of 8.8 million in individually analyzed reserves, overshadowing a quarter of otherwise positive trends in executing the aforementioned balance sheet management strategy. These improvements reflect our continued efforts to shift the mix in the loan portfolio and reduce the reliance on high-cost deposits as a primary source of liquidity. 
 
 Assets . Total assets were 1.65 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 22.1 million, or 1.3 , from 1.67 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in net loans. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 81.7 million, or 37.1 , to 138.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 220.3 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in deposits and an increase in net loans, partially offset by an increase in borrowings. For more information on cash sources and uses please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 
 Loan Portfolio Analysis . Net loans were 1.39 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 65.5 million, or 5.0 , from 1.32 billion at December 31, 2023.The increase in net loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in mortgage warehouse loans of 126.3 million, or 75.8 , and commercial real estate loans of 80.1 million, or 17.1 , partially offset by decreases in enterprise value loans of 85.5 million, or 19.7 , construction and land development loans of 36.5 million, or 46.8 , and a 12.3 million decrease resulting from the closure of the digital asset loan portfolio. These changes reflect 47.3 million in construction and land development loans that converted to permanent commercial real estate loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as the reclassification of approximately 33.8 million in loans from the enterprise value portfolio to the commercial portfolio, following an internal review performed in the third quarter to identify loans in this segment that share the collateral and risk characteristics of a traditional commercial loan. The changing mix of the loan portfolio is illustrative of our current strategy to reduce exposure in our enterprise value lending portfolio in favor of more traditional commercial lending products.

Credit Risk Management . Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. Management of asset quality is accomplished through strong internal controls, monitoring and reporting of key risk indicators, and both internal and independent third-party loan reviews. The primary objective of our loan review process is to measure borrower performance and assess risk to identify loan weakness in order to minimize loan loss exposure. From the time of loan origination through final repayment, commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial, and enterprise value loans are assigned a risk rating. We use an internal loan grading system and formally review the ratings annually for most loans, in addition to independent third-party review. 
 
 Internal and independent third-party loan reviews vary by loan type and, depending on the size and complexity of the loan, some loans may warrant detailed individual review. Other loans may have less risk, which based upon size, or inclusion in a homogeneous pool, reduces the need for detailed individual analysis. Assets with these characteristics, such as consumer loans and residential mortgages, may be individually reviewed based on risk indicators such as delinquency or credit rating. In cases of significant concern, a total re-evaluation of a loan and its associated risks are documented. We may re-evaluate the fair market value or net realizable value to determine the likelihood of potential loss exposure and, consequently, the adequacy of specific and general credit loss reserves. 
 
 When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status, including contacting the borrower at regular intervals. When the borrower is in default, we may commence collection proceedings. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. On a monthly and/or quarterly basis, management provides the Board of Directors delinquency reports and analysis, including information on any foreclosures, if applicable.

Delinquencies. Total past due loans decreased 5.1 million, or 21.8 , to 18.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 23.7 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by modifications on a 19.7 million commercial real estate relationship to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The commercial real estate relationship consists of seven loans for which the Bank executed modifications in the third quarter of 2024 that provided for term extensions on all seven loans and interest rate reductions on five of the loans in the relationship totaling 18.2 million. This decrease in delinquent loans was offset by the delinquency of a 16.2 million construction and land development relationship in the third quarter of 2024, which the Bank is actively pursuing remedies to return to current, accruing status by leveraging the strong collateral position to work out the relationship under terms acceptable to the Bank. 
 
 Non-performing Assets . Non-performing assets include loans that are 90 or more days past due or on non-accrual status and real estate and other loan collateral acquired through foreclosure and repossession. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual status is reversed against interest income. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
 
 Real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. When property is acquired, it is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell, establishing a new cost basis. Declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure will result in charges against income, while operating costs after acquisition are expensed.

Non-accrual loans increased 20.7 million, or 125.0 , to 37.2 million, or 2.64 of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2024, from 16.5 million, or 1.23 of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-accrual loans was primarily due to a 17.6 million enterprise value loan relationship that transitioned to non-accrual status during the second quarter of 2024, and a 16.2 million construction and land development loan relationship that transitioned to non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 12.3 million reduction in non-accrual loans due to the settlement and partial charge-off of the Bank's last digital asset loan relationship during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The enterprise value relationship is a wellness and pain management practice, currently in a period of transition with key personnel. The Bank is in close contact with the company s management team and tightly monitoring the execution of their plan to restore the successful operations of the practice. The Bank is diligent in its efforts to secure its position, work out the loan to perform under its original terms, or seek to exit the relationship under terms acceptable to the Bank. The construction and land development loan was originated in 2022 to fund the construction of a climate-controlled storage facility, which the Bank is actively pursuing remedies to return to current, accruing status by leveraging the strong collateral position to work out the relationship under terms acceptable to the Bank. 
 
 Repayment of non-performing loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying collateral. The Company pursues the resolution of all non-performing loans through collections, modifications, voluntary liquidation of collateral by the borrower and, where necessary, legal action. When attempts to work with a customer to return a loan to performing status, including restructuring the loan, are unsuccessful, the Company will initiate appropriate legal action seeking to acquire property by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure, or to liquidate business assets.

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans . The allowance for credit losses on loans ACLL represents management s estimate of expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the ACLL is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the ACLL in those future periods.

The decrease in the allowance between September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease of 1.4 million in reserves on individually analyzed loans resulting from a payoff of an enterprise value loan which carried a 3.0 million reserve at September 30, 2023 and the settlement and partial charge-off of the last digital asset loan which carried a 7.2 million reserve at September 30, 2023. The decrease related to these two workouts was partially offset by the recognition of an 8.8 million reserve on a 17.6 million enterprise value relationship during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Deposits . Total deposits were 1.29 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 42.7 million, or 3.2 , from 1.33 billion at December 31, 2023. The decreases in deposits were primarily due to decreases in listing service deposits, which decreased 77.4 million, or 58.7 , and brokered deposits which decreased 30.5 million, or 15.6 , from December 31, 2023. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in certificates of deposit of 28.0 million, which contributed to total retail deposit growth of 52.5 million, or 7.1 . The growth in core deposits has provided the opportunity for reductions in higher-yielding deposits from the brokered market and listing services. The Bank will continue to seek opportunities to drive core deposit generation, focusing on leveraging its commercial relationships and increasing its market share within its retail footprint.

Borrowings. The Bank primarily utilizes borrowings to supplement its supply of investable funds. Total borrowings were 124.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 19.9 million, or 19.0 , when compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings of 20.0 million, or 21.1 , used to temporarily fund the increase in the mortgage warehouse portfolio. 
 
 Shareholders Equity. As of September 30, 2024, shareholders equity increased 4.3 million, or 1.9 , to 226.2 million compared to 221.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase included the Company's net income, which totaled 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Shareholders equity to total assets was 13.7 at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.3 at December 31, 2023. Book value per share increased to 12.76 at September 30, 2024, from 12.55 at December 31, 2023. Market value per share increased 7.2 to 10.79 at September 30, 2024, from 10.07 at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effect attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Interest and Dividend Income . Total interest and dividend income was 22.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 799,000, or 3.4 , from 23.2 million the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of short-term investments of 178.7 million, or 69.4 , to 78.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 257.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 35 basis points to 6.11 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.76 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Bank continues to produce a high-yielding loan portfolio at 6.25 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 28 basis points from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense . Total interest expense was 10.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 680,000, or 7.3 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits was 9.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 45,000, or 0.5 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense on deposits from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by a decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of 124.5 million, or 11.6 , partially offset by a 42-basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits. Interest expense on borrowings totaled 952,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 725,000, or 319.4 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on borrowings from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by an increase in the average balance of borrowings and an increase in the cost of borrowings. The average balance of borrowings increased 51.7 million, or 209.8 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The cost of borrowings was 4.99 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 130 basis points from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company s total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.92 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which is an increase of 51 basis points from 3.41 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses . The Company recognized a 1.7 million provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 156,000 credit loss benefit for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The provision for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an additional 1.7 million reserve on a 17.6 million enterprise value relationship, which, as of September 30, 2024, carries a total of 8.8 million in individually analyzed reserves. 
 
 Noninterest Income . Noninterest income was 1.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 57,000, or 3.2 , compared to 1.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Noninterest Expense . Noninterest expense was 11.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense of 1.1 million, or 9.0 , from the prior year quarter was primarily due to: a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 509,000, or 6.5 , mainly resulting from workforce reductions; a decrease in other expenses of 301,000, or 36.0 , primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to the workout and closure of the digital asset portfolio; and a decrease in professional fees of 234,000, or 22.6 , primarily due to reductions in legal and consulting expenses. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company recorded an income tax provision of 132,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 628,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General . Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.4 million, or 0.14 per diluted share, compared to 8.0 million, or 0.48 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 5.6 million, or 70.2 . The Company s return on average assets was 0.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.64 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s return on average equity was 1.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest and Dividend Income . Net interest and dividend income was 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7.8 million, or 17.4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin was 3.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.80 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in net interest income and margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to higher funding costs, highlighting the challenges of operating in a persistent rate-driven, highly-competitive deposit market. 
 
 Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates 
 
 The following table sets forth the average balance sheets, annualized average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the amount of tax-free interest-earning assets is immaterial. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.

Interest and Dividend Income . Total interest and dividend income was 66.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 395,000, or 0.6 , from 66.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's yield on interest-earning assets was 6.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 33 basis points from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Bank continues to produce a high-yielding loan portfolio, at 6.15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 30 basis points from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense . Total interest expense increased 7.4 million, or 33.3 , to 29.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits was 28.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.3 million, or 35.4 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 90 basis points, to 3.80 , and an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of 33.4 million, or 3.5 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense on borrowings increased 32,000, or 2.2 , primarily due to an increase in the cost of borrowings of 75 basis points, to 4.69 , partially offset by a decrease in average total borrowings of 6.9 million, or 14.2 . The Company's total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is an increase of 88 basis points, from 2.95 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a 2.6 million provision for credit losses, compared to 556,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to an 8.8 million individually analyzed reserve in the enterprise value portfolio that was partially offset by the first quarter payoff of an enterprise value loan that resulted in the elimination of 1.1 million in related reserves, a settlement with a digital asset lending customer which resulted in a 3.8 million reduction in related reserves and the elimination of that portfolio and reductions in the general allowance due primarily to decreases in the enterprise value and commercial segments, which each carry a higher reserve rate than other lending segments. 
 
 Noninterest Income . Noninterest income was 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 827,000, or 15.3 , from 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Noninterest Expense . Noninterest expense was 35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.8 million, or 7.2 , from 38.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to: a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 1.7 million, or 7.1 , mainly resulting from workforce reductions; a decrease in other expenses of 533,000, or 22.4 , primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to the workout and closure of the digital asset portfolio; and a decrease in insurance expense of 446,000, or 33.0 . 
 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 571,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an effective tax rate of 19.3 , compared to 2.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 25.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher percentage of net income from non-taxable sources. 
 
 Management of Market Risk 
 
 Net Interest Income Simulation. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income simulation model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period in the current interest rate environment. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumption that interest rates increase 100, 200, and 300 basis points from current market rates and under the assumption that interest rates decrease 100, 200 and 300 basis points from current market rates, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.

Economic Value of Equity Simulation. We also analyze the sensitivity of our financial condition to changes in interest rates through an economic value of equity EVE model. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio represents the dollar amount of our EVE divided by the present value of our total assets for a given interest rate scenario. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology while the EVE ratio reflects that value as a form of capital ratio. We estimate what our EVE would be as of a specific date. We then calculate what EVE would be as of the same date throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. We currently calculate EVE under the assumptions that interest rates increase 100, 200, and 300 basis points from current market rates, and under the assumption that interest rates decrease 100, 200 and 300 basis points from current market rates.

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented above assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, borrowings, and loan repayments and maturities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, mortgage prepayments and sales of securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
 
 We regularly review the need to adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are generally invested in interest-earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities. 
 
 Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 138.7 million. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled 27.4 million at September 30, 2024. Warehouse loans that have a short-term duration, which totaled 259.4 million as of September 30, 2024, also provide additional sources of liquidity. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a borrowing capacity of 136.8 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, of which 60.0 million in short-term advances and 9.6 million in advances with original maturities greater than one year were outstanding. At September 30, 2024, we also had an available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston s borrower-in-custody program of 263.6 million, of which 55.0 million in overnight advances were outstanding. 
 
 We have no material commitments or demands that are likely to affect our liquidity other than as set forth below. In the event unforeseen loan demand or commitment utilization were to occur, or we experienced unexpected deposit outflows, we could access our borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston or the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, or obtain additional funds through brokered deposit markets. 
 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 10.9 million and 8.6 million in loan commitments outstanding, respectively. In addition to commitments to originate loans, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 160.5 million and 178.2 million in unadvanced funds to borrowers, respectively. We also had 1.8 million and 1.7 million in outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 A significant decrease in deposits could result in the Company having to seek other sources of funds, including brokered deposits, listing service deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances, and borrowings through the borrower-in-custody program with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our deposits will remain with us and we are confident in our ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered to meet customer expectations. 
 
 The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity. If funding costs are elevated for an extended period of time, it could have an adverse effect on the Company s net interest margin. If an extended recession causes large numbers of the Company s deposit customers to withdraw their funds, the Company might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding. 
 
 BankProv is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the FDIC. At September 30, 2024, BankProv exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and was considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Note 10 Regulatory Capital of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Part II Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 On January 17, 2023, the Company reported a material weakness in financial controls on its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2022. Shortly thereafter, the Company began receiving voluntary requests from the staff of the Boston Regional Office of the SEC. The Company has been cooperating with the staff s ongoing voluntary requests. On October 24, 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff of the Boston Regional Office of the SEC informing the Company that the staff had made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an action against the Company for violating certain sections of the federal securities laws (the Wells Notice ). The staff has indicated that the Wells Notice relates to the Company s disclosures regarding loans that the Company made to companies engaged in the mining of cryptocurrency - a line of business the Company ceased originating new loans in as of October 2022. The Wells Notice indicates that the staff s recommendation to the SEC may involve a civil injunction action or other action allowed by law, and may seek remedies that include an injunction, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and such other relief as may be available. 
 
 The Wells Notice is neither a formal allegation nor a finding of wrongdoing. It allows the recipient the opportunity to address the issues raised by the enforcement staff before they make an enforcement recommendation to the SEC or the SEC votes on whether to authorize an enforcement action. 
 
 The Company intends to pursue the Wells Notice process, which will include an opportunity to respond to the staff s position via a Wells Submission, and also expects to engage in a dialogue with the staff to explore a potential resolution of this matter. The results of the Wells Notice process and any corresponding enforcement action and the costs, timing and other potential consequences of responding and complying therewith are unknown at this time. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes in risk factors applicable to the Company from those disclosed in Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
