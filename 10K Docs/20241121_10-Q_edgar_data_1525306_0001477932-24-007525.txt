The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q. Our Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. Overview First America Resources Corporation is a Nevada corporation formed on May 10, 2010, with registered address at 1955 Baring Blvd, Sparks, Nevada 89434. First America Resources Corporation has offices at 1000 East Armstrong Street, Morris, IL 60450, and contact telephone number 815-941-9888. The Corporation was originally known as Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc. when formed. The Corporation amended its Articles of Incorporation as follows: The Corporation changed its name from Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc. to First America Resources Corporation. The effective date of the amendment was when final approval from FINRA was received, which was August 26, 2014. We were previously engaged in selling the lithium-ion batteries and related power supplies that mainly are used in mobile and consumer electronics products, such as readers, DVD players, digital cameras and digital video recorders, communications products, electric-power bikes and mopeds, miner s lamps, electric-power tools, electric-power sources for instruments and meters and other similar electrical equipment that can run on batteries. On February 6, 2013, pursuant to an Agreement between Mr. Keming Li, former CEO/President and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Issuer ), Ms. Guoling Jin, former Treasury and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Ms. Madison Li (the stockholder) of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Mr. Jian Li (the Purchaser ), Mr. Jian Li became the principal stockholder and Chief Executive Officer and Tzongshyan George Sheu the former Vice-President, Secretary of the Company and a Director on the Board of Directors of the Company as well. In connection with this change of control, we discontinued our current business. It is anticipated we will acquire FAMCe (formerly known as First America Metal Corporation), a business owned primarily by Mr. Jian Li, or another operating company, depending upon completion of audit and preparation of required filing on Form 8-K, which we currently hope to complete in the next 12 months but may take longer than such currently anticipated dates. FAMCe in Morris, IL is an international scrap metal company specializing in recycling of non-ferrous and electronic material and has become one large exporter of scrap metal in the Midwest. FAMCe is operating a business branch in Fort Worth, Texas since November 2014 and operating the Georgia branch since January 2016. Management anticipates that after acquisition we will be competitive in pricing of some or all of the following, depending upon market conditions which can change, even rapidly, from time-to-time: Copper, Brass, Stainless, Aluminum, High Temp Alloys, Zinc, Tin, Cobalt, Tungsten Alloys, and electronic material. 3 Table of Contents 600 Wissahickon Ave, Cedartown GA Description: Tract 1 -1.425 Acres, Tract 2 2.554 Acres and 72,000SF facility, Tract 3 2.724 Acres and 28,000 SF facility totaling 6.703 acres and 100,000 SF industrial facility located in the 2 nd District, 4 th Section of the City of Cedartown, Polk County, Georgia. Status: Unoccupied, for rent. Anticipated Mortgage: Owned Outright Owner: Value Trade, LLC Current Value: 250,000 Current Mortgage Debt: Zero We are refocusing our intention initially on acquiring similar properties. However, our ability to do so will depend upon our ability to secure additional equity financing and, if necessary or appropriate, mortgage financing on these properties. We will not acquire any property unless we believe the property will generate sufficient cash flow to cover all operating costs, including mortgage payments. Also, in August / September 2023, we received 160,992 of battery inventory from Vestwoods Technology Limited. We were experimenting with selling this type of product. The product did not need to be paid for 6 months and could be returned if the company found no market for this product. To this point, we have sold only 2 inverters out of this inventory in September for total Revenue of 3,920. In September, it was decided to return the remaining consignment inventory as we have not found a significant market in which to sell. We also note that the Company is really an extension of the many years of operational history of management, as disclosed in the registration statement as follows: Our president, Jian Li, has significant real estate experience, primarily involving construction and management of various kinds of properties, specifically industrial properties of various type in multiple states. In managing properties, he oversaw purchases, approving leases, maintaining communication with villages or cities to be in compliance with all ordinances. He handled tenant complaints, interviewed perspective tenants, handled roofing issues, plumbing issues, and door issues by hiring outsourced labor. He also handled all accounting issues including maintenance of books and negotiated with banks on loans. Results of Operations For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, and 2023: Revenue The Company sales revenue for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 0 and 3,920 respectively. Cost of Revenue The Company cost of goods sold for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 0 and 13,369 respectively Expenses Our expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows: For the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, there were total of 1,250 and 4,217 operating expenses, respectively. 4 Table of Contents Detail is shown in the below table: Quarter Ended Quarter Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Expense Bank Service Charges 100 97 License Registration - - Professional Fees 1,150 4,120 Total Expense 1,250 4,217 We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in future periods if and when we close our planned acquisition as described above. 5 Table of Contents Income Operation Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. We paid no income taxes in the USA for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 due to the net operation loss in USA. Net Loss We incurred net losses of 1,250 and 13,666 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024 At June 30, 2024 Current Ratio .25 0.26 Cash 34,207 34,807 Working Capital (173,888 (172,638 Total Assets 59,207 59,807 Total Liabilities 233,095 232,445 Total Equity (173,888 (172,638 Total Debt/Equity -1.32 -1.33 Current Ratio = Current Asset / Current Liabilities Working Capital = Current asset - Current Liabilities Total Debt / Equity = Total Loans from Officers / Total Shareholders Equity 6 Table of Contents The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 34,207 on September 30, 2024, and negative working capital of 173,888. There were total liabilities of 233,095 on September 30, 2024. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 34,807 on June 30, 2024, and negative working capital of 172,638. There were total liabilities of 232,445 on June 30, 2024. Until we generate operating revenues or receive other financing, all our costs, which we will incur irrespective of our business development activities, including bank service fees and those costs associated with SEC requirements associated with staying public, will be funded by Jian Li, our President and Director. Mr. Li is not obligated to pay these costs and any costs advanced will be treated as a demand loan with to be agreed interest. These costs are estimated to be less than 50,000 annually until we close our potential acquisition. If we fail to meet these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the over-the-counter bulletin board, or if we have secured a qualification, may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board. Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently, we fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will now own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting. At September 30, 2024, we owe Mr. Li an aggregate of 228,933 on these loans, which are oral and bear no interest, due upon demand. After our potential acquisition, we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding, except for the anticipated loans from management as described above. Our lack of revenues and cash raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations. The Company s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 7 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. The Company s controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) at September 30, 2024 based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 8 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
