PART
III 

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

On
December 31, 2019, Investor Venture Society IVS then court-apointed custodian of GiveMePower Corporation (the GMPW ),
sold one Special 2019 series A preferred share Series A Share for 38,000 to Goldstein Franklin, Inc. Goldstein ),
a California corporation. One Series A Share is convertible to 100,000,000 shares of common stocks at any time. As at the date of this
change of control transaction, GMPW has zero assets, zero revenue and zero operations. GMPW has to depend on loans from its officers
and directors to fund its operations until it has established enough to raise its own capital or generate revenue. Thus, GMPW has recorded
several material transactions involving its directors and officers and entities controlled by its directors and officers. 

1.
The company has entered into the following transactions in which the management or related persons have interest in that are strategic
to the ordinary course of our operations between December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021: 

(a)
On December 31, 2019, Goldstein sold one-member unit of Alpharidge Capital, LLC Alpharidge ), a California limited liability
corporation, representing 100 member owner of Alpharidge to GMPW in exchange for 1. As a result, Alpharidge became a wholly owned subsidiary
of GMPW until December 30, 2021 when the Company sold Alpharidge to Kid Castle Educational Corporation( KDCE) an entity controlled
by Mr. Frank Igwealor our officer and director, and a subsidiary of Video River Networks, Inc. NIHK ), another entity controlled
by Mr. Frank Igwealor our officer and director. Both KDCE and NIHK are publicly traded companies with ticker symbols KDCE and NIHK respectively. 

(b)
On September 16, 2020, GMPW sold 1,000,000 shares of GMPW preferred stock to KDCE in exchange for 3 and 100 interest in, and control
of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC CED Capital ), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97 of the issued
and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation that held 100,000 shares of KDCE
preferred stock and 900,000,000 shares of KDCE common stock. The 1,000,000 shares of GMPW preferred stock sold to KDCE gave to KDCE approximately
87 voting control of GMPW. 

(c)
On April 21, 2021, GMPW sold all of its interest in CBDX to Premier Information Management, Inc. PIFR for 1 in cash.
As further consideration pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned Kid Castle Educational Inc., the parent Company of GMPW, the 100,000
shares of KDCE preferred stock and 900,000,000 shares of KDCE common stock that CBDX bought in October of 2019. Pursuant to the April
21, 2021 transaction, CBDX ceased from being a subsidiary of GMPW, effective April 1, 2021. 

(d)
On December 30, 2021, GMPW sold Alpharidge to KDCE in exchange for the 1,000,000 GMPW s preferred stock which controlled 87 of
GMPW s voting power. KDCE was the holder of the GMPW preferred until December 30, 2021 when GMPW repurchased the shares in exchange
for Alpharidge. GMPW immediately canceled the 1,000,000 GMPW s preferred shares. 

2.
 The company also entered into the several transactions in which the management or related persons have interest in within the ordinary
course of our operations between December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021. 

Subsequent
to the CBDX transaction, the Company also recorded several large-dollar transactions in its real estate business that involved and benefited
our officers and directors as well as companies controlled by our officers and directors. Because our business had limited revenue and
operating income over the period, most of our operating activities are financed by borrowing from our officers and directors as well
as companies controlled by our officers and directors. Several transactions were reported in Alpharidge but not on the company s
balance sheet because Alpharidge was no longer a subsidiary of GMPW as at December 30, 2021, and could not be consolidated into the company s
12/31/2021 audited financial based on the ASC 810, US GAAP rules for consolidations. Prior to the sale of Alpharidge, the following related
parties transactions were recorded between Alpharidge, our officers and directors as well as companies controlled by our officers and
directors: 

(a)
 Line of Credit On September 15, 2019, Alpharidge entered into a line of credit agreement in the amount of 41,200 with
Goldstein in order to access funding for its operations. The maturity date of the line of credit is February 15, 2020, at which date
the line of credit agreement was amended to the amount of 190,000 and maturity date extended to September 14, 2022. The line of credit
bears interest at 0 per annum and interest and unpaid principal balance is payable on the maturity date. As of December 30, 2021, Alpharidge
had repaid the entire balance on the LOC. The business purpose of this LOC was to provide Alpharidge with working capital with 0 interest
cost. 

(b)
 Line of credit - On May 5, 2020, Alpharidge entered into a line of credit agreement in the amount of 1,500,000 with Los Angeles
Community Capital LACC ), which is controlled by Frank I. Igwealor, GMPW s officer and director. It carries an interest
rate of 0 per annum and interest and unpaid principal balance is payable on the maturity date. Alpharidge had drawn 588,859 from the
line of credit as of December 30, 2021. The business purpose of this LOC was to provide Alpharidge with Real Estate acquisition capital
with 0 interest cost. 

(c)
Long-term liabilities Effective December 31, 2020, Alpharidge entered a proprietary model licensing agreement, pursuant to which
it would pay certain percent of such revenue generated by designated activities to LACC. As at December 30, 2021, pursuant to the agreement,
the Alpharidge had accrued a total of 4,747,906 long-term liability payable to LACC. Combined with the outstanding balance of the LOC
of 588,859, Alpharidge s total liabilities to LACC as at December 30, 2021 was about 5.3 million. The business purpose of this
agreement was to expand Alpharidge s revenue generation through profit sharing models. 

(d)
Long term Notes Receivable On October 12, 2021, Alpharidge made a long-term loan to CED Capital in the total amount of 200,000
for working capital to cover operating expenses and down-payments for real estate purchases. The business purpose of this Loan was to
provide CED Capital with Intercompany working capital with 0 interest cost. 

(e)
 Mortgage Note On or around November 12, 2021, Alpharidge made a Mortgage Loan of 2.2 million to Frank and Patience Igwealor
to purchase the real estate property located at Playa Del Rey, California. The mortgage was secured by a lien on the property whose total
purchase price was 2.4 million. The mortgage s 5 interest rate was appealing to Alpharidge since it was significantly above the
prevailing fixed mortgage rate of 3.10 on November 18, 2021. Had the Igwealors secured their mortgage from a traditional financial institution
at 3.10 , Alpharidge would have forfeited a lucrative business prospect. Not amortizing the principal and deferring interest payments
until the loan matures was a standard practice for Alpharidge. Without exception, all loans in Alpharidge s portfolio throughout
2022 and 2023 included deferred interest features. Calculating the compound interest on a 5 mortgage over a 10-year term, the total
return would be 1.4 million, yielding a 64 return on investment, secured by the very property the loan financed. By accepting the mortgage,
Mr. Igwealor facilitated Alpharidge s long-term investment in real estate, acting as a testament to his generous support for the
company. Since selling Alpharidge to GMPW on 12/31/2019 for 1, Mr. Igwealor has been the sole source of capital Alpharidge s operational
funding via Igwealor s personal resources and through companies he controls. Alpharidge has not raised any capital from public
offerings or third-party investors. The business purpose of this Mortgage was to build long-term capital preservation and sustainable
growth through real estate and mortgage holdings. 

(f)
 Mortgage Note On December 30, 2021, Alpharidge made a mortgage loan to CED Capital in the amount of 314,000 to aid the
acquisition of certain real estate property. The mortgage loan was secured by first/senior lien on the property purchased. The business
purpose for this mortgage was to empower CEDC to make an opportunistic real estate acquisition. 

(g)
On December 30, 2021, GMPW repurchased back from KDCE, the 1,000,000 GMPW preferred share, which controls 87 voting block of GMPW, held
by Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a subsidiary of Video River Networks, Inc., in exchange for one of GMPW s subsidiaries,
Alpharidge Capital LLC Alpharidge ), which effectively became an operating subsidiary of KDCE. The consolidated financial
statements of the Company do not include Alpharidge. All of the entities involved in this transactions were controlled by our officers
and directors. 

In
late 2021, the decision to simplify the company s financials by divesting the complex balance sheet of Alpharidge was made, following
advice from an OTC Markets Consultant. The sale of Alpharidge was a transaction between two public company that previously had parent
-subsidiary relationship. The subsidiary (GMPW) decided to spin-off one of its operating units to the parent (KDCE) in exchange for freedom
from the parent-subsidiary relationship. The recommendation was to streamline the balance sheet to improve the chances of getting the
 Caveat Emptor tag removed from GMPW, as requested in a submission to FINRA. When Igwealor gained control of GMPW in 2019,
it was already marked with this cautionary tag. After transitioning GMPW to SEC reporting, Igwealor sought its removal, and was awaiting
a favorable response. The sale of Alpharidge was strategically executed to simplify the balance sheet, aligning with the consultant s
projection for attracting a favorable decision from FINRA. This strategy paid off when the removal of the Caveat Emptor tag was confirmed
on May 12, 2023, fulfilling the primary objective of the sale.
