option-pricing model, and implied number of common shares upon conversion. The repayment upon maturity was based on the total principal
and accrued interest through the maturity date. At the Conversion Date, the fair value of the Augmenta Note was determined by the derived
equity value of Augmenta, based on the ownership percentage obtained by all notes that were converted on the Conversion Date.

The Company estimates the fair value of each option
award using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Forfeitures are recognized when realized. The aggregate intrinsic value of
stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the Company s
common stock for those stock options that had strike prices lower than the fair value of the Company s common stock. 

Weighted average grant date fair value 

Assumptions 

Expected volatility 

Expected term (in years) 

Risk-free interest rate 

Expected dividend yield 

The risk-free interest rate was obtained from
U.S. Treasury rates for the applicable periods. The Company s expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility for industry
peers and the historical volatility of the Company s common stock and used an average of those volatilities. The expected life of
the Company s options was determined using the simplified method as a result of limited historical data regarding the Company s
activity for employee awards and the contractual term for nonemployee awards. The dividend yield considers that the Company has not historically
paid dividends, and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company uses the mean of the high and low sales prices
of the Company s common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of the common stock. 

Restricted Stock Units 

In April 2024, the Company granted restricted
stock units RSUs under its 2018 and 2021 Plans. Each RSU entitles its holder to share of common stock upon settlement
of the RSU. The settlement of each RSU is subject to the Company s receipt of additional capital greater than a specified threshold.
In addition, RSUs granted under the 2021 Plan were subject to stockholder approval of an increase in the shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan, which took place on June 4, 2024. As the vesting of all of the RSUs is contingent on the Company s
receipt of additional capital, the Company will not recognize any compensation expense until it is determined the receipt of additional
capital is probable of being achieved. The fair value of each RSU is determined based on the mean of the high and low sales prices on
the date of grant and when all required approvals have been obtained.

warrants to purchase shares of common stock to the placement agent. Each warrant issued to the placement agent is immediately exercisable
on the date of issuance at an exercise price of per share and expires from the date of issuance. 

In connection with the May 2024 Offering, the
Company issued pre-funded warrants exercisable for an aggregate of shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase
 shares of common stock to investors. Each pre-funded warrant is immediately exercisable on the date of issuance at an exercise
price of per share and may be exercised at any time until all of the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. Each Series B
warrant is immediately exercisable on the date of issuance at an exercise price of per share and expires from the date
of issuance. The Company also issued warrants to purchase shares of common stock to the placement agent. Each warrant issued to
the placement agent is immediately exercisable on the date of issuance at an exercise price of per share and expires

The Company evaluated these warrants to assess
their proper classification and determined that the warrants meet the criteria for equity classification in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet. The warrants issued to the placement agent were considered offering costs and netted against additional paid-in capital.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Cautionary Statement 

The following discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in
this report. The information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q is not a complete description of our business or the risks
associated with an investment in our common stock. We urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in
this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. 

In this report we make, and from time to time
we otherwise make written and oral statements regarding our business and prospects, such as projections of future performance, statements
of management s plans and objectives, forecasts of market trends, and other matters that are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements containing the
words or phrases will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, 
 estimates, projects, believes, expects, anticipates, intends, 
 target, goal, plans, objective, should or similar expressions identify
forward-looking statements, which may appear in our documents, reports, filings with the SEC, and news releases, and in written or oral
presentations made by officers or other representatives to analysts, stockholders, investors, news organizations and others, and in discussions
with management and other of our representatives. 

Our future results, including results related
to forward-looking statements, involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks included in Part II, Item 1A. Risk
Factors in this report. No assurance can be given that the results reflected in any forward-looking statements will be achieved.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. Our forward-looking statements are based upon
assumptions that are sometimes based upon estimates, data, communications and other information from suppliers, government agencies and
other sources that may be subject to revision. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or keep current
either (i) any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of such statement or (ii) the important
factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by
us, or which are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement. 

Overview 

The purpose of the following discussion and analysis
is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management s
perspective, including to describe and explain key trends, events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are reasonably
likely to impact our future performance. 

As previously announced,
on November 14, 2024, following the conclusion of our review of strategic alternatives, our board of directors Board approved
the dissolution and liquidation of our Company Dissolution ), pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution Plan of Dissolution ), which plan is subject to stockholder approval. On November 14, 2024, in connection with the planned
wind down of the Company s operations, the Board unanimously approved a reduction-in-force (the Reduction in Force of substantially all of our employees to be effective on November 15, 2024. We expect to incur one-time charges associated with the workforce reduction of approximately 1.8 million, primarily related to severance payments, benefits and related termination
costs, of which up to approximately 82,000 in severance will be paid prior to November 30, 2024 to non-executive employees. The estimates
of charges, costs and expenses that the Company expects to incur in connection with the workforce reduction are subject to a number of
assumptions and actual results may differ materially from estimates. 

As a result of our Board s
approval of the Dissolution, that certain Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement License Agreement dated April
20, 2022 between the Company and The University of Texas at Austin, on behalf of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System
automatically terminated under the terms of the License Agreement. Pursuant to the License Agreement, we held
an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license to the patent rights for our thin film freezing platform, which was the foundational intellectual
property upon which our business model was based. Whether our stockholders approve the Dissolution, we have, for all practical purposes,
lost the intellectual property rights necessary to continue our historical operations. Further, our remaining assets, including our Company-owned
intellectual property rights and clinical data, have limited value to anyone other than the successor, if any, to the patent rights formerly
represented by the License Agreement. 

18 

The Plan of Dissolution
contemplates an orderly wind down of our business and operations in accordance with the provisions of Delaware law. If our stockholders
approve the Plan of Dissolution, we intend to file a Certificate of Dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State dissolving the Company,
satisfy or resolve our remaining liabilities and obligations (to the extent of cash or other assets available therefor), including but
not limited to contingent liabilities and claims and costs associated with the dissolution and liquidation, make reasonable provisions
for unknown claims and liabilities (to the extent of available cash or other assets therefor) and attempt to convert all of our remaining
assets into cash or cash equivalents, and make distributions to our stockholders of cash available for distribution, if any, subject to
applicable legal requirements. The proxy materials that we will file with the SEC and mail to our stockholders will contain more important
information regarding the proposed Plan of Dissolution. 

We
cannot predict with certainty the amount of distributions, if any, to our stockholders. W hile
there is some possibility that we may realize greater than expected value
in the future from our remaining assets, including our Company-owned intellectual property rights
and clinical data, based on the information currently available to us and if our stockholders approve the Dissolution, we expect
as of the date of this report that there will not be any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in the Dissolution. Our
expectation is based on the fact that our current cash assets plus the cash we reasonably expect to realize from the disposition of our
non-cash assets is significantly less than our current liabilities plus the expected costs of carrying out the Plan of Dissolution. 

Pursuant to Delaware
law, the Company will continue to exist for three years after the Certificate of Dissolution is filed or for such longer period as the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall direct. If our stockholders approve the Dissolution, we will be authorized to cease operations, sell
or otherwise dispose of our non-cash assets and dissolve the Company and its subsidiaries without further approval of the stockholders,
unless required to obtain such approval under Delaware law. 

If our stockholders do
not approve the Dissolution, the Board will explore other alternatives to Dissolution, if any, available to the Company, including seeking
voluntary dissolution at a later time with diminished assets or seeking bankruptcy protection. However, we do not anticipate that any
amounts available to our stockholders under those alternative scenarios would exceed any amounts available in connection with the Dissolution. 

The following discussion
and analysis of our business, financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and should also take into account our recent announcement
regarding our planned Dissolution. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with our planned Dissolution.
As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report, our
actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following
discussion and analysis. 

General 

Until recently, TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(NASDAQ: TFFP) was a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products
based on our patented Thin Film Freezing, or TFF, technology platform. Based on our internal and sponsored testing and studies, we
believe that our TFF platform can significantly improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, which make up approximately
40 of marketed pharmaceuticals worldwide, thereby improving the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of those drugs. We believe
that in the case of some new drugs that cannot be developed due to poor water solubility, our TFF platform has the potential to
increase the pharmacokinetic effect of the drug to a level allowing for its development and commercialization. When administered as
an inhaled dry powder for treatment of lung disorders, we believe the TFF platform formulations can be used to increase efficacy and
minimize systemic toxicities and drug-drug interactions. 

As of the date of this report, we have two product
candidates in clinical trials, TFF Tacrolimus Inhalation Powder, or TFF TAC, and TFF Voriconazole Inhalation Powder, or TFF VORI. To date,
we have completed one Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and one Phase 1b study in patients with asthma exploring the safety, tolerability
and pharmacokinetics of TFF VORI. We have also completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers exploring the safety, tolerability and
pharmacokinetics of TFF TAC. We have initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of TFF TAC and TFF VORI and, in December 2023, we released positive
initial data from both trials, along with clinical data from our ongoing TFF VORI Expanded Access Program. In March 2024, we announced
our decision to prioritize clinical development of TFF TAC based on positive Phase 2 data. In March 2024, we announced that we are evaluating
strategic options for TFF VORI to preserve capital resources. We concluded our Phase 2 clinical trials of TFF VORI in the first half of
2024. We provided interim updates to the TFF TAC Phase 2 trial in May and August 2024 and ended enrollment in the ongoing TFF TAC Phase
2 study in October 2024.

Recent Developments 

March 2024 Offering 

On March 22, 2024, we completed a registered direct
offering, selling 147,500 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to 147,500 shares of our common stock at an offering
price of 8.00 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable upon issuance at an exercise price of 8.00 per share and will expire
five and one-half years following the date of issuance. We received gross proceeds of approximately 1.2 million before deducting placement
agent fees and other offering expenses. 

May 2024 Offering 

On May 1, 2024, we completed a public offering
of (i) 578,914 shares of our common stock; (ii) pre-funded warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,086,305 shares of common stock;
and (iii) Series B warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,665,219 shares of common stock issued pursuant to a securities purchase
agreement, dated April 29, 2024 between us and certain institutional investors. The offering price of each common share and accompanying
Series B warrant was 2.875. The offering price of each pre-funded warrant and accompanying Series B warrant was 2.8749. 

The Series B warrants have an exercise price of
 2.75 per share of common stock, are exercisable upon issuance and expire five years from the date of issuance. The pre-funded warrants
are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at a nominal consideration of 0.0001 per share of common stock at any time until all
of the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. We also issued warrants to designees of the placement agent exercisable for an aggregate
of 116,565 shares of common stock. The placement agent warrants have substantially the same terms as the Series B warrants, except that
the placement agent warrants have an exercise price equal to 3.5938 per share. 

We received net proceeds of approximately 4.2
million from the offering, after deducting offering expenses payable by us, including the placement agent s commissions and fees. 

Results of Operations 

We were formed in January 2018 and have not commenced
revenue-producing operations. To date, our operations have consisted of the development and early-stage testing, Phase 1 human clinical
trials of our initial product candidates and the Phase 2 clinical trials of our TFF TAC and TFF VORI. In March 2024, we announced our
decision to prioritize clinical development of TFF TAC based on positive Phase 2 data. Also in March 2024, we announced that we are evaluating
strategic options for TFF VORI to preserve capital resources. We have generated limited grant revenue and non-recurring revenue under
feasibility and material transfer agreements. 

We do not expect to receive any further feasibility
or grant revenue from the date of this report as a result of our Dissolution. We expect to continue
to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future in connection with the Dissolution and the Reduction in
Force. Our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be used primarily for the payment and settlement of creditor
and other claims against the Company, to fund the wind down of our operations, execute the Reduction in Force, and execute the Plan of
Dissolution, as approved by our Board and subject to the approval of our stockholders.

We have entered into feasibility and material
transfer agreements with third parties that provide us with funds in return for certain research and development activities. On June 23,
2023, we were awarded a Direct to Phase II Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, grant of approximately 2.8 million to continue
development of a novel, pan-flu multivariant mucosal vaccine. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from
the feasibility and material transfer agreements decreased by approximately 83,000 and revenues from the SBIR grant increased by approximately
 42,000. The decrease in feasibility revenues is due to less activity for open agreements and the increase in grant revenues is due to
more services being provided. The costs associated with the feasibility and material transfer agreements and SBIR grant are expensed as
incurred and are reflected as a component of research and development expense.

Research and development expense decreased during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreases of 0.3 million in manufacturing
and related expenses, 0.3 million in clinical and preclinical expense, approximately 68,000 in payroll and related expense and approximately
 60,000 in other research and development expenses. Manufacturing expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023 were higher
because of the manufacturing of products for the Phase 2 trials of TFF TAC and TFF VORI. Clinical expenses decreased year over year due
to wind down of the TFF VORI trial in 2024. We expect our current level of research and development expenses to decrease with the Reduction in Force, termination
of TFF TAC clinical trial and the Company s planned Dissolution.

General and administrative expense decreased during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreases of 0.2 million in payroll
related expenses, 0.1 million in insurance and office expenses and approximately 84,000 in other general and administrative expenses,
offset by increases of 0.2 million in consulting expenses and approximately 34,000 in market research expenses. The decrease in general
and administrative expenses was due in part to strategic cost reduction efforts implemented by management. We expect our current level of general and administrative expenses to decrease with the Reduction in Force and
the Company s planned Dissolution.

the note was converted into shares of Vaxanix in June 2024. 

We incurred a net loss of 3.5 million and 4.4

Research and development expense decreased during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 2.1 million reduction in manufacturing
and related expenses, offset by increases of 0.4 million in clinical and preclinical expenses and 0.5 million in payroll and related
expense. Manufacturing expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were higher because of the manufacturing of products for
the Phase 2 trials of TFF TAC and TFF VORI. Clinical expenses were higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the increase
in the number of patients enrolled in the Phase 2 trials of TFF TAC. We expect our current level of research and development expenses to decrease with the Reduction in Force, termination
of TFF TAC clinical trial and the Company s planned Dissolution.

General and administrative expense decreased
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreases of 1.1
million in payroll related expenses, 0.5 million in insurance and office expenses, 0.2 million in market research expenses and
 0.1 million in other general and administrative expenses, offset by increases of 0.1 million in professional and legal fees and
 0.2 million in consulting expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due in part to strategic cost reduction
efforts implemented by management. We expect our current level of general and administrative expenses to decrease with the Reduction in Force and
the Company s planned Dissolution. 

The following table summarizes our other income
(expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 together with the percentage change.

Interest income, net decreased during fiscal 2024
due to a lower average balance of cash equivalents. The fair value of the note receivable decreased during fiscal 2024 due to the estimated
fair value of the shares received in Augmenta upon conversion, which were exchanged for shares in Vaxanix. 

We incurred a net loss of 13.8 million and 16.5
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Financial Condition 

As of September 30, 2024, we had total assets
of approximately 7.1 million and a working capital deficit of approximately 0.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity included
approximately 2.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our non-cash assets,
including our Company-owned intellectual property rights and clinical data, have limited value to anyone other than the successor, if
any, to the patent rights formerly represented by the License Agreement 

We expect to continue
to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future in connection with the Dissolution and the Reduction in
Force. Our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be used primarily to fund the wind down of our operations,
execute the Reduction in Force, and execute the Plan of Dissolution, as approved by our Board and subject to the approval of our stockholders.
We intend to hold a Special Meeting to seek stockholder approval of the Plan of Dissolution. Our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due within one year from the date
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

We
cannot predict with certainty the amount of distributions, if any, to our stockholders. W hile
there is some possibility that we may realize greater than expected value
in the future from our remaining assets, including our Company-owned intellectual property rights
and clinical data, based on the information currently available to us and if our stockholders approve the Dissolution, we expect
as of the date of this report that there will not be any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in the Dissolution. Our
expectation is based on the fact that our current cash assets plus the cash we reasonably expect to realize from the disposition of our
non-cash assets is significantly less than our current liabilities plus the expected costs of carrying out the Plan of Dissolution. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Critical accounting policies are described in
our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a material change to our critical accounting policies previously disclosed regarding our
accounting for an investment in a non-marketable security in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 321, Investments
 Equity Securities . 

23 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our management s discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments
and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience.
The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from
the date of change in estimates. 

We hold an investment Vaxanix Bio, Ltd Vaxanix ),
which is a non-marketable equity security that does not have a readily determinable fair value, therefore we have elected to measure the
investment at cost less any impairment, adjusted to fair value if there are observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical
or similar investment of the same issuer, which is a material change to our accounting estimates as reported in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. 

At each reporting period, we perform an assessment
to determine if the investment still qualifies for this measurement alternative. We also make a qualitative assessment considering impairment
indicators to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. If a qualitative assessment indicates the investment is impaired, we estimate
the investment s fair value. If the fair value is less than the investment s carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded
in the consolidated statements of operations equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value and a new basis in the
investment is established. 

Due to the proximity between when the investment
in Vaxanix was obtained and September 30, 2024, the qualitative factors considered for the period ended September 30, 2024, included Vaxanix s
progress and likelihood of obtaining equity financing at a price per share lower than the current value of our investment. As of September
30, 2024, there are no indicators of impairment. 

While the qualitative factors utilized by management
represent the most important factors to assess for potential impairment of the investment in the non-marketable equity security, as determined
by management, there is inherent uncertainty in this assessment. If our assessment determined the investment is impaired, the assumptions
used to calculate the investment s fair value would be management s best estimates and would also include inherent uncertainties.
If the factors utilized or underlying assumptions and estimates change, our investment may be impaired in future periods. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon their evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to September 30, 2024,
we implemented the Reduction in Force impacting Mr. Coleman as our Chief Financial Officer and Dr. Weisman was terminated as our Chief
Executive Officer, each effective November 14, 2024. Also, effective November 14, 2024, our then-board of directors appointed Mr. Jalbert
as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, including for the purposes of providing certifications regarding our disclosure
controls and procedures. The workforce reduction and appointment of Mr. Jalbert resulted in necessary changes to our system of internal
controls as Mr. Jalbert is performing control activities that he was not performing prior to the Reduction in Force. We expect changes
in our system of internal controls over financial reporting in future periods as we align our control structure with the current workforce.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Investing in our common stock involves a high
degree of risk. Before purchasing our common stock, you should read and consider carefully the following risk factors as well as all other
information contained in this report, including our financial statements and the related notes. Each of these risk factors, either alone
or taken together, could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not
presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial, which could also impair our financial position. If any of the events described
below were to occur, our financial condition, our ability to access capital resources, our results of operations and/or our future growth
prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. As a result, you could lose
some or all of any investment you may make in our common stock. 

The announcement and
implementation of the Reduction in Force of our employees and the Dissolution, whether or not such Dissolution is consummated, has adversely
affected our business. The announcement and implementation of the Reduction in Force of our employees in connection with the wind-down
of our operations and the Dissolution, whether or not such Dissolution is consummated, has adversely affected the trading price of our
common stock, our business and our relationships with third parties, including our partners and clinical research organizations. As a
result of our Board s approval of the Dissolution, that certain Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement License Agreement dated April 20, 2022 between the Company and The University of Texas at Austin, on behalf of the Board of Regents of the University of
Texas System automatically terminated under the terms of the License Agreement. Pursuant to the License Agreement, we held
an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license to the patent rights for our thin film freezing platform, which was the foundational intellectual
property upon which our business model was based. Whether our stockholders approve the Dissolution, we have, for all practical purposes,
lost the intellectual property rights necessary to continue our historical operations. Further, our remaining assets, including our Company-owned
intellectual property rights and clinical data, have limited value to anyone other than the successor, if any, to the patent rights formerly
represented by the License Agreement. 

We
do not expect to be able to make distributions to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, before a dissolved corporation may make
any distribution to its stockholders, it must pay or make reasonable provision to pay all of its claims and obligations, including all
contingent, conditional or unmatured contractual claims known to the corporation. While there is some possibility that we may realize
greater than expected value in the future from our remaining assets, including our Company-owned
intellectual property rights and clinical data, based on the information currently available to us and if our stockholders approve
the Dissolution, we expect as of the date of this report that there will not be any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders
in the Dissolution. Our expectation is based on the fact that our current cash assets plus the cash we reasonably expect to realize from
the disposition of our non-cash assets is significantly less than our current liabilities plus the expected costs of carrying out the
Plan of Dissolution. 

If
our stockholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, our Board will seek other alternatives to dissolving the Company. We do not anticipate
that any amounts available to our stockholders under those scenarios would exceed any amounts available in connection with the Dissolution. 
If our stockholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, our Board will explore alternatives to the Dissolution, if any, available
to the Company, including seeking voluntary dissolution at a later time with diminished assets or seeking bankruptcy protection. Given
that our primary remaining assets are limited to our Company-owned intellectual property and rights to data generated in clinical trials
of for TFF TAC and TFF VORI, we do not anticipate that any amounts available to our stockholders under those scenarios would exceed any
amounts available in connection with the Dissolution. 

25 

We
may be subject to securities or other litigation, which is expensive and could divert our attention. We may be subject to securities
class action or other litigation in connection with the Dissolution. Securities or other litigation against us could result in substantial
costs and divert our management s attention from completing the Dissolution, which could harm our business and increase our expenses. 

We
may no longer be required to file reports with the SEC during the pendency of or following the consummation of the Dissolution. 
We may file a notice terminating our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act during the pendency of or following the consummation
of the Dissolution. Once effective, we may no longer be required to file any annual, quarterly or other current reports with the SEC.
If we are no longer required to file reports with the SEC, stockholders will have very little public information available about us and
our operations which will further affect the trading and liquidity of our common stock. 

If
we continue to be required to file reports with the SEC, we will incur costs and expenses relating to such reporting obligations. 
If we continue to have obligations to file annual, quarterly and other current reports with the SEC during the pendency of or following
the consummation of the Dissolution, we will have to incur costs and expenses to make such filings and to comply with the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

If
we fail to retain the services of appropriate personnel, the Plan of Dissolution may not succeed. The success of the Plan of Dissolution
depends in large part upon our ability to retain the services of qualified personnel who will be charged with winding up our business
following the Dissolution, subject to the Board s continued oversight. The retention of qualified personnel may be particularly
difficult under our current circumstances. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining the services of such qualified
personnel or that we will be able to retain the services of such qualified personnel for the amounts we are willing to pay for such services.
