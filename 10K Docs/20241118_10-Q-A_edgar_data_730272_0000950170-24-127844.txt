 million one-time cash payment (the Payment ), which was received in April 2023. At the time of cancellation, no product units had been delivered under the Cancelled PO s and the Company had two other purchase orders from the same customer for the same product Open PO s ). The Company originally accounted for the Cancelled PO s as a single contract and recognized the million payment as component of product revenue in the first quarter of 2023. Subsequent to the issuance of the Original Report, the Company reassessed the accounting treatment of the Payment and concluded that the Cancelled PO s and Open PO s represented a combined contract such that the February 2023 transaction should have been analyzed and accounted for as a contract modification, which required the Payment to be deferred and recognized as product units were delivered under the Open PO s. All Open PO product units were fully delivered to the customer by June 30, 2024. The correction of the Misstatement affects certain financial statement line items in these condensed consolidated financial statements including but not limited to product revenues, income tax provision, foreign currency translation, deferred revenues, prepaid expenses, deferred taxes and earnings-per-share. Consolidated Financial Statements - Restatement Reconciliation Tables The following tables present the impact of the financial statement adjustments on the Company's previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements. The "Previously Reported" amounts in the following tables are amounts derived from the Original Report. The amounts in the columns labeled "Revenue Adjustments" represent the effect of adjustments resulting from the correction of the overstatement of revenues associated with the Payment and related tax impact. The amounts in the columns labeled "Other Adjustments" represent the effect of other adjustments that relate to other unrelated errors in previously filed financial statements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to those filed financial statements. The effects of both the restatement for the Revenue Adjustments and the immaterial Other Adjustments have been corrected in all impacted tables and footnotes throughout these condensed consolidated financial statements.

Contingent Consideration Earnouts As of March 31, 2024 , the maximum amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to pay in connection with the completed acquisitions is; million over a three-year earnout period for Avitide, Inc. Avitide ), which was acquired in September 2021 and for which the earnout periods run from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024; million over a two-year earnout period for FlexBiosys, Inc. FlexBiosys ), which was acquired in April 2023 and for which the earnout periods run from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024; and approximately million over a one-year earnout period for Metenova Holding AB Metenova ), which was acquired in October 2023 and for which the earnout period runs from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. See Note 4, Acquisitions to this report for additional information on the contingent consideration earnouts. Since the date of acquisition, expected results and changes in market inputs used to calculate the discount rate related to Avitide, FlexBiosys and Metenova, have resulted in changes in amounts reported as the Company s contingent consideration obligation.

 Fair Value Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis During the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no re-measurements to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Convertible Senior Notes In July 2019, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2019 Notes ). Interest is payable in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes will mature on July 15, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the carrying value of the 2019 Notes was million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and the fair value of the 2019 Notes was million and million, respectively. On December 14, 2023, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of its 1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2023 Notes in a private placement pursuant to separate, privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreements (the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2019 Notes and certain other qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities Act ). Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements, the Company exchanged million of its 2019 Notes for million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Exchange Transaction and issued million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Subscription Transactions for million in cash. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the 2023 Notes was million and million, respectively, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost and the fair value of the 2023 Notes was million and million, respectively. The fair value of the 2023 Notes and the 2019 Notes is a Level 1 valuation and was determined based on the most recent trade activity of the 2023 Notes and 2019 Notes as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The 2023 Notes and 2019 Notes are discussed in more detail in Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, to these condensed consolidated financial statements.

million. The Metenova Acquisition was funded through payment of million in cash, the issuance of unregistered shares of the Company's common stock totaling million and contingent consideration with an immaterial fair value. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Metenova were recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values, and consolidated with those of the Company. The fair value of the net liabilities acquired is estimated to be million, the fair value of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be million and the residual goodwill is estimated to be million. The estimated consideration and preliminary purchase price information has been prepared using a preliminary valuation. Acquisition-related costs are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are expensed in the periods in which costs are incurred. The Company has incurred million of transaction and integration costs associated with the Metenova Acquisition from the date of acquisition to March 31, 2024, with million of transaction and integration costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The transaction costs are included in operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income for the period ended March 31, 2024. Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired The preliminary allocation of purchase price is based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. As of March 31, 2024, the purchase accounting for this acquisition had not been finalized. As additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise its preliminary purchase price allocation during the remainder of the measurement period. During 2024, the Company recorded a net working capital adjustment of million related to an inventory adjustment, offset in goodwill, to align the Metenova opening balance sheet. Besides tax implications of the purchase price allocation, the final allocation may result in additional changes to other assets and liabilities.

Severance and employee-related costs under the Restructuring Plan are primarily associated with actual headcount reductions. Costs incurred include cash severance and non-cash severance, including other termination benefits. Severance and other termination benefit packages are based on established benefit arrangements or local statutory requirements and we recognized the contractual component of these benefits when payment was probable and could be reasonably estimated. Non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation were recognized on long-lived assets that were taken out of service before the end of their normal service due to the shutdown of manufacturing facilities and production lines, in which case depreciation estimates were revised to reflect the use of the assets over their shortened useful life. The restructuring accrual is included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024 and the balance is expected to be paid by the third quarter of 2024.

When disaggregating revenue, the Company considered all of the economic factors that may affect its revenues. Because its revenues are from bioprocessing customers, there are no differences in the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows from any of its product lines. However, given that the Company s revenues are generated in different geographic regions, factors such as regulatory, economic and geopolitical developments within those regions could impact the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows. Disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region and revenue from significant customers can be found in Note 15, Segment Reporting, included in this report.

1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 On December 14, 2023, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 Notes in the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2019 Notes and certain other qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements and to the Exchange Transaction, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes in a private placement to accredited institutional buyers (the Subscription Transactions for million in cash. The Company evaluated the Exchange Transaction and determined approximately million of the million principal of the exchanged 2019 Notes should be accounted for as extinguishments of debt and approximately million should be accounted for as modification of debt. As a result, we recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2023, inclusive of million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under modification accounting, the carrying amount of the modified 2019 Notes was reduced by million, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital, to account for the increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option, representing a debt discount of the modified 2019 Notes. The aggregate debt discount of million as of March 31, 2024, comprised of million increase in principal of the modified 2019 Notes and a million increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option. The aggregate debt discount of million as of December 31, 2023, comprised of million increase in principal of the modified 2019 Notes and a million increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option. These amounts are presented as a direct reduction from the carrying value of the convertible debt in their respective periods presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. This amount is being accreted into interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income using the effective interest method over the term of the 2023 Notes. Proceeds from the Subscription Transactions were million, net of debt issuance costs of million. The Exchange Transaction resulted in million of the debt issuance costs related to the modified 2019 Notes, which were expensed as incurred in accordance with modification accounting, and million of deferred debt issuance costs related to the 2023 Notes, which were recorded as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the 2023 Notes on the Company s condensed consolidated

million of debt issuance costs of the 2023 Notes into amortization of debt issuance costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income over the remaining term of the 2023 Notes. The carrying value of the 2023 Notes of million and million is included in long-term debt on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company used million of the proceeds from the Subscription Transactions to repurchase shares of its common stock from certain purchasers of the 2023 Notes. For more information regarding this repurchase, see Note 13, Stockholders Equity - Share Repurchases included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the Company's Form 10-K/A. The Company will also use a portion of the proceeds to finance in part, the settlement upon conversion or repurchase of the remaining 2019 Notes at or prior to maturity. The remainder of the proceeds will be used for working capital. The 2023 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and bear interest at a rate of per year. . The 2023 Notes will mature on , unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. The initial conversion rate for the 2023 Notes is shares of the Company s common stock per principal amount of 2023 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share and represents a premium over the last reported sale price of per share on December 6, 2023, the date on which the 2023 Notes were priced. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028, the 2023 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of 2023 Notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain quarters commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024, into cash up to their principal amount, and into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company s election, for the conversion value above the principal amount, if any. Thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the 2023 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of 2023 Notes at any time regardless of these conditions. The Company may redeem for cash, all or a portion of the 2023 Notes, at its option, on or after December 18, 2026 and prior to the 21 st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date, if certain conditions are met in accordance to the indenture governing the 2023 Notes (the 2023 Notes Indenture ).

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the 2023 Notes was million and million, respectively, net of unamortized discount, and the fair value of the 2023 Notes was million and million, respectively. The fair value of the 2023 Notes was determined based on the most recent trade activity of the 2023 Notes at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 The Company issued million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes on July 19, 2019 in a transaction which included the underwriters exercise in full of an option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes (the Notes Offering ). The net proceeds of the Notes Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other related offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately million. Immediately following the closing of the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, subsequent to the conversion of another million, million in aggregate principal amount remains outstanding.

per year. The remaining 2019 Notes will mature on , unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. The initial conversion rate for the 2019 Notes is shares of the Company s common stock per principal amount of 2019 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 15, 2024, the 2019 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of 2019 Notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. Thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the remaining 2019 Notes will be convertible at the options of the holders of 2019 Notes at any time regardless of these conditions. The 2019 Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to maturity. During the first quarter of 2024, the closing price of the Company s common stock exceeded of the conversion price of the 2019 Notes for more than trading days of the last consecutive trading days of the quarter. As a result, the 2019 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the 2019 Notes during the second quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the terms of the 2019 Notes. These conditions have been met each quarter since the third quarter of 2020. As a result, as of the date of this filing, excluding the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, the Company has received requests to convert million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and all but million have been settled as of March 31, 2024. The remaining outstanding requests for conversions will settle in the second quarter of 2024. The conversions resulted in the issuance of a nominal number of shares of the Company s common stock to the note holders. Because the 2019 Notes mature within one year of the report date, the Company classifies the carrying value of the 2019 Notes as current liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2024.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, shares and shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares and were therefore anti-dilutive. In July 2019, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of its 2019 Notes. As provided by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture underlying the 2019 Notes, upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, the Company will use a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, settling the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess

Immediately following the closing of the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2023 with terms unchanged. As of March 31, 2024, subsequent to the conversion of another million, million in aggregate principal amount remains outstanding. As mentioned above and as provided by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture underlying the 2019 Notes, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion obligation for the 2019 Notes in a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock. This means the Company will settle the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. The Company is required to reflect the dilutive effect of the convertible securities by application of the if-converted method, which means the denominator of the EPS calculation would include the total number of shares assuming the 2019 Notes had been fully converted at the beginning of the period. Accordingly, the par value of the 2019 Notes was not included in the calculation of diluted income per share, but the dilutive effect of the conversion premium was considered in the calculation of diluted net income per share using the treasury stock method. The dilutive impact of the 2019 Notes was based on the difference between the Company s current period average stock price and the conversion price of the 2019 Notes, provided there was a premium. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the dilutive effect of the conversion premium included in the calculation of diluted earnings was shares and shares, respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview 
 Repligen and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Repligen Corporation Repligen , we , our , or the Company is a global life sciences company that develops and commercializes highly innovative bioprocessing technologies and systems that increase efficiencies and flexibility in the process of manufacturing biological drugs. 
 As the overall market for biologics continues to grow and expand, our customers primarily large biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations and other life sciences companies (integrators) face critical production cost, capacity, quality and time pressures. Built to address these concerns, our products help set new standards for the way biologics are manufactured. We are committed to inspiring advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of critical biologic drugs including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines and cell and gene therapies that are improving human health worldwide. Increasingly, our technologies are being implemented to overcome challenges in processing plasmid DNA (a starting material for the production of mRNA) and gene delivery vectors such as lentivirus and adeno-associated viral vectors. For more information regarding our business, products and acquisitions, see Part I, Item 1, Business , included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on November 18, 2024 Form 10-K/A ). 
 We currently operate as one bioprocessing business, with a comprehensive suite of products to serve both upstream and downstream processes in biological drug manufacturing. Building on over 40 years of industry expertise, we have developed a broad and diversified product portfolio that reflects our passion for innovation and the customer-first culture that drives our entire organization. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to maximize the value of our product platform through both organic growth initiatives (internal innovation and leveraging commercial opportunities) and targeted acquisitions. 
 Restatement 
 As previously described in the Explanatory Note above and in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have restated our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of March 31, 2024 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. As a result, the previously reported financial information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 in this Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been updated to reflect the relevant restatement. Refer to Note 1 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the adjustments and the impacts on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other than the effect of the restatement as described in Note 1 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, this section has not been otherwise modified and does not reflect any information or events occurring after May 1, 2024, the filing date of the Original Report, or modify or update those disclosures affected by events that occurred at a later date or facts that subsequently became known to the Company, except to the extent they are otherwise required to be included and discussed herein. 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 As a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are therefore subject to non-U.S. exchange exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce our revenue and gross profit margin and impact the comparability of results from period to period. 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cost inflation, primarily in raw materials, and other supply chain costs, as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including global geopolitical conflicts and labor shortages. Actions taken to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation, including price increases and productivity improvements, have generally been successful in offsetting the impact of these trends. In addition, decreasing demand for vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic, including all 
 31 

subsequent variants of the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus is driving a reduction in future demand of our products related to these vaccines. 
 2023 Acquisitions 
 Acquisition of FlexBiosys, Inc. 
 On April 17, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in FlexBiosys, Inc. FlexBiosys ), pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement with FlexBiosys, TSAP Holdings Inc. NJ Seller ), Gayle Tarry and Stanley Tarry, as individuals (collectively with NJ Seller, the Sellers ), and Stanley Tarry, in his capacity as the representative of the Sellers (the FlexBiosys Acquisition ). 
 FlexBiosys, which is headquartered in Branchburg, New Jersey, offers expert design and custom manufacturing of single-use bioprocessing products and a comprehensive range of products that include bioprocessing bags, bottles, and tubing assemblies. These products will complement and expand our fluid management portfolio of offerings. 
 Acquisition of Metenova Holding AB 
 On October 2, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in Metenova Holding AB Metenova ), pursuant to a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with, inter alia, Metenova for approximately 173 million in cash and the Company's equity. Metenova will further strengthen our fluid management portfolio with its magnetic mixing and drive train technologies that are widely used by global biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a description of our critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K/A. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto.

Product revenues (As Restated) 
 We focus on selling our products directly to customers in the pharmaceutical industry and to our contract manufacturers. These direct sales represented approximately 90.5 and 82.6 of our product revenue for each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales of our bioprocessing products can be impacted by the timing of large-scale production orders and the regulatory approvals for such antibodies, which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations. 
 32 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, product revenue decreased by 12.2 million, or 7.4 , as compared to the same period of 2023. This is mainly due to a decrease in revenue from programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as customers inventory has reduced at a slower pace than initially expected, which has primarily affected revenue from sales of our filtration products. In addition, revenue from our proteins franchise decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to March 31, 2023 due to weak demand reflecting the Cytiva (a standalone operating company owned by Danaher Corporation) drop-off since they are producing product in-house and lower forecast for ligands from other customers. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue is an increase in revenue from the acquisitions of FlexBiosys and Metenova, both completed after March 31, 2023.Revenue from sales by the remaining franchises for the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained relatively in line with similar revenue from the same period of 2023. 
 Royalty and other revenues 
 Royalty and other revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 relate to royalties received from a third-party systems manufacturer associated with our OPUS chromatography columns. Royalty revenues are variable and are dependent on sales generated by our partners. 
 Costs of goods sold and operating expenses 
 Total costs and operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were comprised of the following:

Cost of goods sold (As Restated) 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 5.5 million, or 6.7 , for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with lower revenue as well as a decrease in employee-related costs resulting from a decline in manufacturing headcount since March 31, 2023. Partially offsetting this was an increase in cost of goods sold that relate to the operations of FlexBiosys and Metenova, which have been in our results of operations since the acquisition dates in April 2023 and October 2023, respectively and 0.6 million of one-time costs incurred from restructuring activities during the first quarter of 2024, for which there were no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. 
 Gross margin was 50.1 and 50.5 in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lower margins were a result of lower overall sales and production volumes, and a change in product mix, where we saw a significant decline in revenue associated with higher-margin consumable products due to the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine demand. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development R D expenses are related to bioprocessing products, which include personnel, supplies and other research expenses. Due to the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs, we do not track all of our expenses or allocate any fixed costs by program, and therefore, have not provided historical costs incurred by project. 
 R D expenses decreased 0.9 million, or 7.5 , during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee-related costs, including bonus paid during the first quarter of 2024. We also had a decrease in spending on new product development during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in R D expenses that relate to the operations of FlexBiosys and Metenova, which have been in our results of operations since the acquisition dates in April 2023 and October 2023, respectively, and 0.2 million of one-time costs incurred from restructuring activities during the first quarter, for which there were no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. 
 33 

R D expense also includes payments made to expand our proteins product offering through our agreement with Navigo Proteins GmbH Navigo ). Such expenses were 0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 1.1 million and for the same period in 2023, in the form of milestone payments to Navigo. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (As Restated) 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include the costs associated with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our marketing efforts, including legal, accounting, patent, shareholder services, amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions. 
 SG A costs increased by 5.5 million, or 9.8 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. The increase in SG A costs partially relate to the operations of FlexBiosys and Metenova, which have been included in our results of operations since the acquisition dates in April 2023 and October 2023, respectively. In addition, there were 0.7 million in one-time costs incurred from restructuring activities during the first quarter, for which there were no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. We also had an increase in employee-related costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023 due to an increase in SG A headcount since March 31, 2023 and our annual merit increase in salaries. 
 Contingent consideration 
 Contingent consideration expense represents the change in fair value of the contingent consideration obligation included in current and noncurrent contingent consideration on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of the end of each period. Remeasurement of the contingent consideration obligation is done each quarter and the carrying value of the obligation is adjusted to the current fair value through our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Expected results and a change in market inputs used to calculate the discount rate, resulted in a change of 1.2 million to the expense reported for the three months ended March 31, 2023. No adjustment was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as management s assessment was that the balances of the contingent consideration obligations already represented fair value.

Investment income 
 Investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances. Our investment income increased by 3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023 due to an increase in interest rates on higher average invested cash balances since March 31, 2023. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in interest earned in 2023 on U.S. treasury bills purchased at the end of 2022, for which there was no comparable amount recorded in 2024. We expect investment income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is primarily from contractual coupon interest on the convertible debt outstanding as of March 31, 2024. On December 14, 2023, we entered into a privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreement with certain holders of our 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2019 Notes and certain new investors pursuant to which we issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2023 Notes ). Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 includes 0.1 million of interest on the 2019 Notes, 
 34 

compared to 0.3 million of interest expense on the 2019 Notes in the same period of 2023. Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 also includes 1.5 million of contractual coupon interest on the 2023 Notes as well as 3.3 million in accretion of the 82.1 million debt discount on the modified notes, which includes the accretion of an increase in principal and the accretion of increased fair value of the conversion option for the three months ended March 31, 2024, for which there were no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. See Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on this transaction. 
 Amortization of debt issuance costs 
 Transaction costs related to the issuance of the 2019 Notes and the 2023 Notes are amortized to amortization of debt issuance costs on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, amortization of debt issuance costs included 0.1 million of amortization of costs related to the 2019 Notes and 0.4 million of amortization of costs related to the 2023 Notes, compared to 0.5 million of amortization related to the 2019 Notes recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2023. 
 Other (expenses) income 
 The change in other (expenses) income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, is primarily attributable to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to transactions with customers and vendors, as well as the revaluation impact of intercompany loans with subsidiaries. 
 Income tax provision (As Restated) 
 Income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Effective tax rate 

10.8 

17.3 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of 0.4 million and 3.2 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was 10.8 and 17.3 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is based upon the estimated income for the year ending December 31, 2024 and the composition of income in different jurisdictions. The difference in effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to lower income before income taxes and stock windfall tax benefits. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to stock windfall tax benefits. 
 In 2021, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 . We continue to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a resulting material impact to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources (As Restated) 
 We have financed our operations primarily through revenues derived from product sales, the issuance of the 2019 Notes in July 2019, the 2023 Notes in December 2023 and the issuance of common stock in our December 2020, July 2019 and May 2019 public offerings. Our revenue for the foreseeable future will primarily be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue. 
 On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. Subsequently, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that SVB depositors would have access to all of their money. We have a banking relationship with SVB and hold cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 0.1 million as of March 31, 2024 in SVB depository accounts to cover short-term operational payments. While we have not experienced any losses in such accounts, the failure of SVB in 2023 caused us to utilize our accounts at other financial institutions in order to mitigate potential operational risks stemming from the temporary inability to access funds in our SVB operating accounts. As a result of bank failures, such as SVB, our access to funding sources in 
 35 

amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired and could negatively impact the financial institutions with which we have direct arrangements, or the financial services industry or economy in general. 
 At March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 780.6 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 751.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Working capital increased by 3.1 million to 949.5 million at March 31, 2024 from 946.4 million at December 31, 2023 due to the various changes noted below. 
 On December 14, 2023, the Company issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 Notes in a private placement pursuant to separate, privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreements (the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2019 Notes and certain other qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities Act ). Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements, the Company exchanged 217.7 million of its 2019 Notes for 309.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Exchange Transaction and issued 290.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Subscription Transactions for 290.1 million in cash. Proceeds from the Subscription Transactions amounted to 276.1 million after debt issuance costs of 13.9 million. The 2023 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and bear interest at a rate of 1.00 per year. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2024. The 2023 Notes will mature on December 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. During the first quarter of 2024, the closing price of the Company's common stock did not exceed 130 of the conversion price of the 2023 Notes for more than 20 trading days of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter. As a result, the 2023 Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders of the 2023 Notes during the second quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the 2023 Notes Indenture. For more information on the 2023 Notes, see Note 9, "Convertible Senior Notes," to this report. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 of the conversion price of the 2019 Notes for more than 20 trading days of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter. As a result, the 2019 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the 2019 Notes during the second quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the terms of the 2019 Notes. These conditions have been met each quarter since the third quarter of 2020. As a result, as of the date of this filing and excluding the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, 0.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes have been requested for conversion by the note holders since the issuance of the 2019 Notes and all but 0.1 million of the requests have been settled as of March 31, 2024. The conversions resulted in the issuance of a nominal number of shares of our common stock to the note holders. Since the 2019 Notes mature within one year of the report date, we classify the carrying value of the 2019 Notes as current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2024.

Operating activities (As Restated) 
 For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our operating activities provided cash of 44.7 million reflecting net income of 3.3 million and non-cash charges totaling 32.8 million primarily related to depreciation, intangible amortization, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, stock-based compensation charges, deferred income taxes, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and operating lease right of use asset amortization. A decrease in accounts receivable provided 6.7 million of cash and was primarily driven by lower revenue. We also had a decrease in inventory manufactured that provided 3.2 million, a net 
 36 

increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 2.3 million, primarily due to an increase in unearned revenue and accrued employee bonuses, and a net increase in operating lease liability due to new operating leases entered into during 2024 provided cash of 3.0 million. An increase in prepaid expenses, primarily related to subscriptions and taxes consumed 2.3 million. The remaining cash provided by operating activities resulted from favorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 For the three months ended March 31, 2023, our operating activities provided cash of 11.2 million reflecting net income of 15.3 million and non-cash charges totaling 26.2 million primarily related to depreciation, amortization, contingent consideration adjustments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation charges and operating lease right of use asset amortization. An increase in accounts receivable consumed 16.8 million of cash and was primarily driven by the timing of collections from customers. Additionally, we had an increase in inventory manufactured that consumed 5.8 million. A decrease in accounts payable consumed 1.2 million and was due to the timing of payments to vendors. An increase in prepaid expenses due to payment of subscriptions consumed 2.8 million and a decrease in accrued liabilities consumed 2.3 million primarily related to the payment of employee bonuses during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The remaining cash provided by operating activities resulted from favorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 Investing activities 
 Our investing activities consumed 8.4 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was due to capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2024, which consumed 8.4 million in cash. Included in this amount for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 Our investing activities consumed 9.4 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was due to capital expenditures in 2023 as we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity worldwide. Of these expenditures, 0.9 million represented capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 Our financing activities consumed 9.0 million of cash for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily for 7.6 million in cash disbursed for shares withheld to cover employee income tax due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and the payment of 2.2 million to settle the cash portion of the First Earnout Year contingent earnout obligation related to our acquisition of FlexBiosys in April 2023. This was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period. 
 Our financing activities consumed 9.6 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily for cash disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income tax due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units. This was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period. 
 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on cash during the three months ended March 31, 2024 is a result of the weakening of the Swedish krona against the U.S. dollar by 6 and the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar by 2 . 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 the expansion of our bioprocessing business; 

the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products and successfully integrate them into our business; 

our ability to acquire additional bioprocessing products; 

the scope of and progress made in our R D activities; 

the scope of investment in our intellectual property portfolio; 

contingent consideration earnout payments resulting from our acquisitions; 

the extent of any share repurchase activity; 

the success of any proposed financing efforts; 

general economic and capital markets; 

change in accounting standards; 

37 

the impact of inflation on our operations, including our expenditures on raw materials and freight charges; 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 

costs associated with our ability to comply with, emerging environmental, social and governance standards. 

Absent acquisitions of additional products, product candidates or intellectual property, we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 24 months from the date of this filing. We expect operating expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year to increase as we continue to expand our bioprocessing business. We expect to incur continued spending related to the development and expansion of our bioprocessing product lines and expansion of our commercial capabilities for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements may include, but are not limited to, purchases of property, plant and equipment, the acquisition of additional bioprocessing products and technologies to complement our existing manufacturing capabilities and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio. 
 We plan to continue to invest in our bioprocessing business and in key R D activities associated with the development of new bioprocessing products. We actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including acquiring products, technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio. We continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders. In order to acquire such assets, we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments. If our available cash balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of any such acquisition-related financing needs or lower demand for our products, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt funding. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders, and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (As Restated) 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of 31.1 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of 4.8 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 4.9 million. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2043, while the federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards have unlimited carryforward periods and do not expire. We had federal and state business tax credits carryforwards of 5.8 million available to reduce future federal and state income taxes. The business tax credits carryforwards will expire at various dates through December 2043. Net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service, state and foreign jurisdictions and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 Our assets are primarily monetary, consisting mainly of cash and cash equivalents. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, furniture, fixtures and office equipment, computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources. 
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Further information on potential risk factors that could affect our financial results are included in the filings made by us from time to time with the SEC including under the sections entitled Risk Factors in our Form 10-K/A. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AN D PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate DCPs (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). DCPs are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company carried out an evaluation as of March 31, 2024 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s DCPs pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based on such evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the previously reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are described in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2023, and as disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K/A, the Company identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 
 1. A material weakness in the operation of our controls over the deferred income tax accounting for complex and non-routine transactions. Specifically, management did not have adequate supervision and review controls over the complex accounting for deferred income tax on the exchange of our outstanding 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 and

the issuance of 1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, including work performed by external advisors and the internal review of such transaction and related analyses. 

2. As a result of the restatement, a material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of controls related to revenue recognition specific to the evaluation of accounting for contract terms. 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has not remediated these material weaknesses. As a result, the Company s management concluded that at March 31, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses 
 As previously disclosed in the Form 10-K/A, management is implementing remedial actions under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to address the identified deficiencies. 
 Our income tax remediation efforts include the following activities: 
 Improve our process to identify and select qualified third-party advisors, including enhanced review of capabilities and work performed, specifically related to the review of tax advice and related accounting guidance. 

Implement a process to verify the controls, processes and internal reviews performed by third-party advisors. 

Consider whether the non-routine transaction warrants additional advisor oversight or validation of analyses based on complexity or changes in applicable regulations. 

Increase education for internal resources on complex transactions to enhance diligence capabilities with third-party advisors. 

Our revenue recognition remediation efforts include the following activities: 
 Designing new internal controls to validate there is a complete listing of revenue contracts that have non-standard terms, which require incremental accounting analysis under ASC 606. 

Designing new internal controls evaluating the accounting for contract amendments, including amendments accounted for as contract modifications. 

Enhancing and expanding our existing revenue recognition control procedures and attributes when evaluating the accounting impact of non-standard contract terms and contract modifications. 

Increasing education for internal resources on accounting for contracts within the scope of ASC 606 and deploying enablers to facilitate documentation of accounting analyses and conclusions. 

We will continue to monitor the design and operating effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management determines appropriate. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 Except for the material weaknesses described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The matters discussed in this Amendment include forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are based on various assumptions by management regarding future circumstances, over many of which Repligen has little or no control. A number of important risks and uncertainties, including those identified under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 31, 2023 and in subsequent filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. There are no material changes to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 31, 2023.
