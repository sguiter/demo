Each Public Unit consists of one ordinary share and one right Public Rights ). Each whole Public Right will entitle the holder to receive one-tenth (1/10) ordinary share upon consummation of initial business combination. 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of units (the Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to Whale Management Corporation (the Sponsor ), generating gross proceeds of to the Company.

Trust Account 

The aggregate amount of per Public Unit) held in a trust account Trust Account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders and maintained by Wilmington Trust National Association, acting as trustee, will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, the funds in the Trust Account will not be released until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem 100 of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial Business Combination within 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or 15 months if the Company enters into a business combination agreement prior to the expiration of the initial 12-month period (the Event )) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate a Business Combination or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of the Company s public shares if the Company is unable to complete its initial Business Combination within nine months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 21 or 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination depending on occurrence of the Event), subject to applicable law. 

Business Combination 

The Company listed the Units on the Nasdaq Global Market NASDAQ ). The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and interest released to pay taxes payable) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that at least per Unit, including the proceeds of the sale of the Private Units will be held in a trust account Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholder, as described below. 

The Company will provide its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

If the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to or more of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

The shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially 10.00 per Public Share, subject to increase of up to an additional 0.30 per Public Share in the event that the Sponsor elects to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination (see below), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s rights. The ordinary shares will be recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 

The Sponsor and any of the Company s officers or directors that may hold Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) (the initial shareholders and the underwriters will agree (a) to vote their Founder Shares, the ordinary shares included in the Private Placement Units (the Private Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) and Private Shares into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares and Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the initial shareholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination. 

The Company will have until 12 months (or 15 months if the Company enters into a business combination agreement prior to the expiration of the initial 12-month period (the Event )) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate a Business Combination within 12 months (or 15 months if the Event occurs), the Company may, but is not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination by an additional month up to 9 times (for a total of up to 21 or 24 months to complete a Business Combination depending on occurrence of the Event) (the Combination Period ). In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the initial shareholders or their affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account (approximately 0.033 per public share in either case), up to an aggregate of , or per public share, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each one month extension. Any funds which may be provided to extend the time frame will be in the form of a loan to the Company from the Sponsor. The terms of any such loan have not been definitely negotiated, provided, however, any loan will be interest free and will be repayable only if the Company completes a Business Combination. 

On October 21, 2024, the Company entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Great Rich Technologies Limited, a public limited company incorporated
under the laws of Hong Kong GRT ), and GRT Merger Star Limited, a Cayman Islands company limited by shares
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of GRT Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, the
Company will merge with and into Merger Sub (the Merger ), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of GRT (the Surviving Company ). 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action of the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any other Person: 

(i) each of the Company s ordinary
shares (the Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding the
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares (each, as defined below), if any, will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and exchanged for
the right to receive, immediately upon consummation the Merger, one (1) ordinary share of GRT (such shares of GRT, collectively, Parent
Ordinary Shares payable in American Depositary Shares of GRT Parent ADSs for each such Company
Share (the Per Share Merger Consideration and 

(ii) each right to receive one-tenth (1/10 th of a Company Share at the consummation of a business combination of the Company (a Company Right that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled, extinguished and exchanged for the right to receive, immediately
upon the consummation of the Merger, Parent Ordinary Shares, payable in Parent ADSs, in an amount equal to (in each case, as rounded down
to the nearest whole number) the product of (a) the Per Share Merger Consideration, multiplied by (b) the number of Company
Shares that the holder of the cancelled Company Right (the Company Rights Holder would have been entitled
to receive from the Company assuming satisfaction of the terms and conditions of such Company Right, multiplied by (c) the ADS exchange
rate of rate of one (1) Parent Ordinary Share per one (1) Parent ADS (the ADS Exchange Rate (the Rights
Merger Consideration ). 

The aggregate consideration payable to pursuant
to the Merger Agreement to the shareholders of the Company Company Shareholders entitled thereto shall consist
of that number of Parent Ordinary Shares payable in Parent ADSs that is equal to (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of Company Shares registered in the name of those Company Shareholders immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied
by the ADS Exchange Rate, plus (ii) the Rights Merger Consideration, as described above. 

Liquidation 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable and less interest to pay dissolution expenses up to 50,000), which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriters have agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than 10.00 per Unit. 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below per share (whether or not the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Going concern consideration 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of and a working deficit of . Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to of such Working Capital Loans may be converted into units of the post Business Combination entity at a price of per unit (See Note 5). 

The Company will have until 12 months (or 15 months if the Company enters into a business combination agreement prior to the expiration of the initial 12-month period) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate a Business Combination. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, the Company will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. There is a possibility that business combination might not happen within the prescribed period of time. 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of the IPO, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their unaudited financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the unaudited financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. The Company s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company s major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

The Company may be subject to potential examination by foreign taxing authorities in the area of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with foreign tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. 

The Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such, the Company s tax provision was zero for the periods presented. 

 and ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of the Company s unaudited balance sheet, respectively.

Public Units, which includes Public Units upon the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, at a purchase price of per Public Unit. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share and one Public Right. Each whole Public Right entitles the holder to receive one-tenth (1/10) ordinary share upon consummation of initial business combination. 

All of the public shares sold as part of the Public Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, or in connection with the Company s liquidation. In accordance with the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. 

The Company s redeemable ordinary share is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital). 

Private Placement Units, at a price of per Private Placement Unit. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one Private Placement Share and one right Private Placement Right ). Each Private Placement Right will entitle the holder to receive one-tenth (1/10) ordinary share upon consummation of the initial business combination. 

The Private Placement Units are identical to the Public Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except for certain registration rights and transfer restrictions.

The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, so those shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.

Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Units. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had borrowings under the working capital loans. 

Related Party Extension Loans 

As discussed in Note 1, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to six times, each by an additional month (for a total of 21 or 24 months to complete a Business Combination).

Rights 

Each holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon exchange of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Proposed Offering.

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on May 14, 2018 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

We expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. 

Results of Operations 

Our entire activity since inception up to September 30,
2024 related to our formation, the preparation for the initial public offering, and since the closing of the initial public offering,
the search for a prospective initial business combination. We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion
of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the amount
held in the Trust Account. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024, we had a net income of 488,327, which consisted of dividend income earned in investments held in Trust Account of 891,298,
partially set-off by formation and operating costs of 402,971.

Contractual Obligations 

Registration Rights 

Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on June 17, 2024, the holders of the insider shares, private placement units (including securities contained therein), and units (including securities contained therein) that may be issued on conversion of working capital loans or extension loans (and) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective date of our initial public offering requiring us to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Underwriting Agreement 

The underwriters are to a cash underwriting discount of 2.0 of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering, or 1,380,000, upon the closing of the initial business combination. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting fee of 2.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 1,725,000, which will be paid upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Administrative Services Agreement 

We entered into an agreement with our sponsor, pursuant to which we agreed to pay our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for secretarial and administrative support services provided to us through the earlier of consummation of the initial business combination and our liquidation. 

In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. A critical accounting estimate to our unaudited financial statements includes the valuation of ordinary shares subject to possible redemption. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Our management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s unaudited financial statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

JOBS Act 

We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

As an emerging growth company , we are not required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (3) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (4) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including amounts in the Trust Account, have been invested in certain U.S. government securities with a maturity of 180 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

21 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective, because of the identification of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to (1) inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel, and (2) insufficient written policies and procedure for accounting, IT, financial reporting and record keeping. In light of these material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, our management believes that the financial statements included in this Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

The Company is not party to any legal proceedings as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in the Prospectus filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Prospectus filed on June 20, 2024.

Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company s public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100 of the Company s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 12 months or 15 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 21 months or 24 months from the closing of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination), or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of the Company s public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 12 months or 15 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 21 months or 24 months from the consummation of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination).
