. We have historically reported net losses,
and negative cash flows from operations, which raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
in previous years. The appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital.
Historically, the Company has obtained funds from investors since its inception through sales of our securities. The Company will also
seek to generate additional working capital from increasing sales from its Ai Platform, creative, website development and digital advertising
service offerings, and continue to pursue its business plan and purposes.

The
Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which do not have vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,
in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee
stock options.

borrowing rate based on the remaining lease terms as of the January 1, 2019, adoption date. 

Operating
lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over
the lease term at the commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives
and initial direct costs incurred, if any. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably
certain that we will exercise that option. Our leases have remaining lease terms of year to years, some of which include options
to extend the lease term for up to an undetermined number of years. 

Operating
Leases 

On
August 1, 2022, the Company signed a lease agreement with JJ Real Co., an unrelated party, which commenced on August 1, 2022, for approximately
 square feet, located at 1114 S St. Mary s Street - Suite 120, San Antonio, TX 78210, for per month, includes a pro
rata share of the common building expenses and each year the monthly lease payment is subject to change per the lease agreement. The
lease expires on July 31, 2027. The lease expiration is greater than twelve months, thus included on the Balance Sheet as Right-of-Use
lease. This lease does not include a residual value guarantee, nor do we expect any material exit costs. As of August 1, 2022, we determined
that this lease meets the criterion to be classified as a ROU Asset and is included on the balance sheet as Right-Of-Use Assets. As of
March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the ROU asset and liability balances of this lease were and , respectively. During
February 2023, JJ Real Co transferred ownership of the building, and our lease located at 1114 S St. Mary s - Suite 120, San Antonio,

Overview- 

AiAdvertising s
primary focus is to disrupt the digital advertising world by offering a solution that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence
(AI) to enable marketers to increase productivity, efficiency, and performance. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources,
are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management
re-evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly those related to the determination of the estimated recoverable amounts of trade
accounts receivable, impairment of long-lived assets, revenue recognition, and deferred tax assets. We believe the following critical
accounting policies require more significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. 

Among
the significant judgments made by management in the preparation of our financial statements are the following: 

Revenue
Recognition 

On
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all subsequent amendments to the ASU
(collectively, ASC 606 ), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as
of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018, are presented under Topic 606, while prior period
amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605. Revenues are recognized
when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Company s
Consolidated Financial Statements. See footnote 3 for a disclosure of our use of estimates and judgement, as it relates to revenue recognition. 

Included
in revenue are costs that are reimbursed by our clients, including third party services, such as photographers and stylists, furniture,
supplies, and the largest component, digital advertising. We have determined, based on our review of ASC 606-10-55-39, that the amounts
classified as reimbursable costs should be recorded as gross, due to the following factors: 

The
Company is primarily in control of the inputs of the project and responsible for the completion of the client contract; 

We
have discretion in establishing price; and 

We
have discretion in supplier selection. 

Accounts
Receivable 

The
Company extends credit to its customers, who are located nationwide. Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade
terms. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. Management reviews accounts receivable
on a regular basis, based on contracted terms and how recently payments have been received to determine if any such amounts will potentially
be uncollected. The Company includes any balances that are determined to be uncollectible in its allowance for doubtful accounts. After
all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off. The balances of the allowance account at March 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023 were 191,889. 

20 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

The
Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of a long-lived asset, management evaluates whether the estimated
future undiscounted net cash flows from the asset are less than its carrying amount. If impairment is indicated, the long-lived asset
would be written down to fair value. Fair value is determined by an evaluation of available price information at which assets could be
bought or sold, including quoted market prices, if available, or the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on reasonable
and supportable assumptions. 

Indefinite
Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets 

The
Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, 
where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one
year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and
revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired
less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. 

The
Company tests for indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the
Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill at December 31, 2023 and determined the fair
value of each intangible asset and goodwill did not exceed the respective carrying values. Therefore, no impairment of indefinite lived
intangibles and goodwill was recognized. 

The
impairment test conducted by the Company includes an assessment of whether events occurred that may have resulted in impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets. Because it was determined that events had occurred which effected the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets,
the Company conducted the two-step approach to determine the fair value and required adjustment. The steps are as follows: 

1. Based
on the totality of qualitative factors, determine whether the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. Qualitative
factors and key assumptions reviewed include the following: 

Increases
in costs, such as labor, materials or other costs that could negatively affect future cash flows. The Company assumed that costs associated
with labor, materials, and other costs should be consistent with fair market levels. If the costs were materially higher than fair market
levels, then such costs may adversely affect the future cash flows of the Company or reporting units. 

Financial
performance, such as negative or declining cash flows, or reductions in revenue may adversely affect recoverability of the recorded value
of the intangible assets. During our analysis, the Company assumes that revenues should remain relatively consistent or show gradual
growth month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. If we report revenue declines, instead of increases or flat levels, then such condition
may adversely affect the future cash flows of the Company or reporting units. 

Legal,
regulatory, contractual, political, business or other factors that could affect future cash flows. During our analysis, the Company assumes
that the legal, regulatory, political or business conditions should remain consistent, without placing material pressure on the Company
or any of its reporting units. If such conditions were to become materially different than what has been experienced historically, then
such conditions may adversely affect the future cash flows of the Company or reporting units. 

Entity-specific
events such as losses of management, key personnel, or customers, may adversely affect future cash flows. During our analysis, the Company
assumes that members of management, key personnel, and customers will remain consistent period-over-period. If not effectively replaced,
the loss of members of management and key employees could adversely affect operations, culture, morale and overall success of the company.
In addition, if material revenue from key customers is lost and not replaced, then future cash flows will be adversely affected. 

Industry
or market considerations, such as competition, changes in the market, changes in customer dependence on our service offering, or obsolescence
could adversely affect the Company or its reporting units. We understand that the market we serve are constantly changing, requiring
us to change with it. During our analysis, we assume that we will address new opportunities in service offering and industries served.
If we do not make such changes, then we may experience declines in revenue and cash flow, making it difficult to re-capture market share. 

21 

Macroeconomic
conditions such as deterioration in general economic conditions or limitations on accessing capital could adversely affect the Company.
During our analysis, we acknowledge that macroeconomic factors, such as the economy, may affect our business plan because our customers
may reduce budgets for our services. If there are material declines in the economy, which lead to reductions in revenue then such conditions
may adversely affect the Company. 

2. Compare
the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the fair value. 

3. If
the carrying amount is greater than the fair value, then the carrying amount is reduced to reflect fair value. 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company decided not to renew its rights to the domain name CLOUDCOMMERCE.COM 
and recorded an impairment to intangible assets in the amount of 20,202.

Business
Combinations 

The
Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets
acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable
assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially
with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future
expected cash flows from acquired customer lists, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful
lives and discount rates. Management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which
are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period,
which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding
offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. 

Fair
value of financial instruments 

The
Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities
are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value, due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. As of March 31,
2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company has zero notes payable. 

Fair
value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability, between market participants at the measurement date. Fair
value measurements assume that the asset or liability is (1) exchanged in an orderly manner, (2) the exchange is in the principal market
for that asset or liability, and (3) the market participants are independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange.
Fair value accounting and reporting establishes a framework for measuring fair value by creating a hierarchy for observable independent
market inputs and unobservable market assumptions and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Considerable judgment is required
to interpret the market data used to develop fair value estimates. As such, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts that could be realized in a current exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methods could
have a material effect on the estimated fair value.

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 

REVENUE 

Total
revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, decreased by 155,429 to 2,019,323, compared to 2,175,452 for the three months ended
March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in client activity in Digital Marketing and Web Development, which was partially
offset by increases in Creative Services and Platform revenues. 

COST
OF REVENUE 

Cost
of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased by 139,824 to 1,795,273, compared to 1,655,449 for the three months
ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in purchased media within digital marketing. 

SELLING,
GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 

Selling,
general and administrative (SG A) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased by 662,061 to 2,064,657 compared
to 1,402,596 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was due increases in advertising and promotion, research
and development, and cloud-based tools. 

IMPAIRMENT
OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded an impairment in certain intangible assets consisting of domain names in the amount
 20,202. There was no comparable transaction in the prior period. 

OTHER
INCOME AND EXPENSE 

Total
other income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, remained constant at zero compared to net other expense of 5 for the three months
ended March 31, 2023. 

NET
LOSS 

The
net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was 1,860,809, an increase of 977,521, compared to the net loss of 883,288 for
the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in net loss for the period was primarily due to an increase in cost of revenue and
SG A expenses, primarily stock-based compensation. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The
Company had a net working capital deficit of 50,160 on March 31, 2024, compared to a net working capital deficit of 1,493,314 on December
31, 2023. 

23 

Cash
flow used in operating activities was 1,423,004 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to cash flow used in operating activities
of 611,081 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in cash flow used in operating activities of 811,923 was primarily
due to increased net loss for the period, decrease in accounts payable to vendors from paying invoices faster, and a reduction in customer
deposits from activating media budgets faster. 

Cash
flow provided by investing activities was 0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023. 

Cash
flow provided by financing activities was 2,500,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to cash flow provided by financing
activities of 556,006 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in cash flow provided by financing activities of 1,943,994
was primarily due to the 2,500,000 cash received for the Series I preferred stock payable to Hexagon Partners. 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

As
of March 31, 2024, the Company had an equity line financing relationship with one investor. During the current period, the investor provides
short-term financing under a stock purchase arrangement disclosed in footnote 6. The Company does not have any long-term sources of liquidity.
As of March 31, 2024, there were no unused sources of liquidity, nor were there any commitments of material capital expenditures. 

The
Company has negative monthly cash flows from operations of approximately 200,000. The Company s current cash is not sufficient
to sustain the Company s operations for approximately 12 months without additional borrowings or further sales of stock. To satisfy
cash needs, the Company relies on the sale of capital stock or can introduce borrowing mechanisms to fund operations, as discussed above. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Management believes that our current
cash flow will sustain our operations and obligations as they become due, additionally will allow the development of our core business
operations. Furthermore, the Company anticipates that it will raise additional capital through investments from our existing shareholders,
prospective new investors and future revenue generated by our operations. 

Any
additional capital we may raise through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute current stockholders ownership
percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities. The terms of the securities issued
by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the
issuance of warrants or other derivative securities which may have a further dilutive effect. 

Furthermore,
any additional debt or equity or other financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are
unable to obtain required additional capital, we may have to curtail our growth plans or cut back on existing business. Further, we may
not be able to continue operations if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations. 

We
may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities
law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection
with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our reported financial results.

Item
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management,
with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the
Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Based
on that evaluation, our management concluded that, due to material adjusting entries related to stock issuances, as of March 31, 2024,
our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal
quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

The
Company s management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent
or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur
or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls
can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation
of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
