Obligations of state and political subdivisions An obligation that is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a state or political subdivision that has the power to tax. Obligations of U.S. Government A federally guaranteed obligation backed by the full power of the U.S. government, including Treasury bills, Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.

In addition, the legislation establishes new consumer protections and amends various securities and investment company-related requirements. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) Risk-weighted assets consist of on and off balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total risk-weighted assets. SBA loan pools Business loans partially guaranteed by the SBA.

 Assessment of Available for Sale Debt Securities for Credit Risk 
 Management assesses the decline in fair value of investment securities on a regular basis. Unrealized losses on debt securities may occur from current market conditions, increases in interest rates since the time of purchase, a structural change in an investment, volatility in earnings of a specific issuer, or deterioration in credit quality of the issuer. Management evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess whether potential credit losses exist. The following is a discussion of the credit quality characteristics of portfolio segments carrying material unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Obli g ations of U.S. Governmental a g encies and sponsored enterprises : 
 As of September 30, 2024, the majority of the Corporation s unrealized losses in available for sale investment securities related to mortgage-backed securities, issued by government-sponsored entities and agencies. Declines in fair value were attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, not credit quality. The Corporation does not have the intent, and it is not likely to be required to, sell these securities prior to anticipated recovery. Due to affiliations with U.S. governmental agencies and or enterprises, the Corporation considers these obligations to carry zero loss estimates, and has not recorded an allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Corporate bonds and notes : 
 The Corporation's corporate bonds and notes portfolio is comprised of subordinated debt issues of community and regional banks. Management considers the credit quality of these investments on an individual basis. Management reviewed the collectability of these securities, taking into consideration such factors as the financial condition of issuers, reported regulatory capital ratios of issuers, and credit ratings when available, among other pertinent factors. All corporate bond debt securities continue to accrue interest and make payments as expected with no defaults or deferrals on the part of the issuers. The decrease in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Corporation considers the potential credit risk of these issuers to be immaterial, and has not recorded an allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Equity Method Investments 
 million and million, respectively. The Corporation also held million of marketable securities as equity method investments as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The Corporation's concentrations of credit risk by loan type are reflected in the preceding table. The concentrations of credit risk with standby letters of credit, committed lines of credit, and commitments to originate new loans generally follow the loan classifications in the table above. 
 Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Accrued interest receivable on loans is included in the accrued interest receivable and other assets line item on the Corporation's Consolidated Balance Sheets, and is excluded from the amortized cost basis of loans and estimate of the allowance for credit losses, as presented in this Note. 
 Commercial and industrial loans includes agricultural loans which totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Agricultural loans were previously presented as a standalone loan category. Prior period information included in this Note reflects agricultural loans as a component of commercial and industrial loans.

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation had loan, a commercial and industrial loan which was given a term extension which experienced a payment default within twelve months of modification. There were loans that defaulted during the three or nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 for which modifications were made subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023. 
 
 The Corporation monitors the performance of loans that have previously been modified under the guidance of ASU 2022-02 in order to gauge the effectiveness of modifications, and to determine the degree to which borrowers continue to demonstrate financial weakness following modification. 
 Residential mortgages Total 
 
 During the three month period ended September 30, 2024 a commercial mortgage which was granted a term extension during the three months ended March 31, 2023 executed an early payoff.

 Collateral Dependent Individually Analyzed Loans

As of December 31, 2023 the amortized cost basis of individually analyzed loans totaled million, of which million were considered collateral dependent. For collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is likely to be substantially provided through the sale or operation of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. 
 Certain assets held as collateral may be exposed to future deterioration in fair value, particularly due to changes in real estate markets or usage. The Corporation closely monitors trends in real estate values throughout its market area to determine whether collateral values, after appropriate discounting, are likely to be sufficient to extinguish existing borrower indebtedness.

 The Corporation uses the risk rating system to identify criticized and classified loans. Commercial relationships within the criticized and classified risk ratings are analyzed quarterly. The Corporation uses the following definitions for criticized and classified loans (which are consistent with regulatory guidelines): 
 
 Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capability of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Commercial loans not meeting the criteria above to be considered criticized or classified, are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed as not rated, are included in groups of homogeneous loans performing under terms of the loan notes.

Unused lines of credit Standby letters of credit 
 Commitments to make real estate and home equity loans are generally made for periods of or less. As of September 30, 2024, the fixed rate real estate and home equity commitments to make loans have interest rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from to . Commitments to fund commercial draw notes are generally made for periods of to . As of September 30, 2024, the fixed rate commercial draw commitments have interest rates ranging from to . 
 Because many commitments and almost all standby letters of credit expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows. Loan commitments and unused lines of credit have off-balance sheet credit risk because only origination fees are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet until commitments are fulfilled or expire. The credit risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts, assuming the amounts are fully advanced and collateral or other security is of no value. The Corporation does not anticipate losses as a result of these transactions. These commitments also have off-balance sheet interest rate risk in that the interest rate at which these commitments were made may not be at market rates on the date the commitments are fulfilled. 
 In conjunction with the Corporation's adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326 ), an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was established as of January 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was million and million, respectively. 
 
 In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding claims and legal proceedings involving the Corporation or its subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation believes that it is not a party to any pending legal, arbitration, or regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on its financial results or liquidity.

Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Introduction 
 
 The following is the MD A of the Corporation in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Reference should be made to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and footnotes, and the Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024, for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis. See the list of commonly used abbreviations and terms on pages 3 6. 
 
 The MD A included in this Form 10-Q contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of the Corporation's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of those risks and uncertainties and the factors that could cause the Corporation s actual results to differ materially from those risks and uncer ta inties, see Forward-looking Statements below, in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and on pages 20 31 of the Corporation s 2023 Form 10-K. For a discussion of the use of non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 63-66 of the Corporation's 2023 Form 10-K, and pages 78-81 in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 The Corporation has been a financial holding company since 2000, the Bank was established in 1833 and CFS in 2001. Through the Bank and CFS, the Corporation provides a wide range of financial services, including demand, savings and time deposits, commercial, residential and consumer loans, interest rate swaps, letters of credit, wealth management services, employee benefit plans, insurance products, mutual funds, and brokerage services. The Bank relies substantially on a foundation of locally generated deposits. The Corporation, on a stand-alone basis, has minimal results of operations. The Bank derives its income primarily from interest and fees on loans, interest income on investment securities, WMG fee income, and fees received in connection with deposit and other services. The Bank s operating expenses are interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings, salaries and employee benefit plans, and general operating expenses. 

Forward-looking Statements 
 
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Corporation intends its forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in these sections. All statements regarding the Corporation's expected financial position and operating results, the Corporation's business strategy, the Corporation's financial plans, forecasted demographic and economic trends relating to the Corporation's industry and similar matters are forward-looking statements. These statements can sometimes be identified by the Corporation's use of forward-looking words such as "may," "will," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," or "intend." The Corporation cannot guarantee that its expectations in such forward-looking statements will turn out to be correct. The Corporation's actual results could be materially different from expectations because of various factors, including changes in economic conditions or interest rates, credit risk, inflation, cybersecurity risks, difficulties in managing the Corporation s growth, recent bank failures, changes in FDIC assessments, public health issues, geopolitical conflicts, competition, changes in law or the regulatory environment, and changes in general business and economic trends. 
 
 Information concerning these and other factors, including Risk Factors, can be found in the Corporation s periodic filings with the SEC, including the discussion under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These filings are available publicly on the SEC s web site at http://www.sec.gov, on the Corporation's web site at http://www.chemungcanal.com or upon request from the Corporate Secretary at (607) 737-3746. Except as otherwise required by law, the Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Critical accounting estimates include the areas where the Corporation has made what it considers to be particularly difficult, subjective, or complex judgments concerning estimates, and where these estimates can significantly affect the Corporation's financial results under different assumptions and conditions. The Corporation prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP. As a result, the Corporation is required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available at that time. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Significant accounting policies followed by the Corporation are presented in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Management considers the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting estimate, given the uncertainty in estimating lifetime credit losses attributable to its portfolios of assets exhibiting credit risk, particularly in its loan portfolio, and the material effect that such judgments can have on the Corporation's results of operations. Determining the amount requires significant judgement on the part of management, is multi-faceted, and can be imprecise. The level of the allowance for credit losses on loans is based on management s ongoing review of all relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and expectations of the future based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 
 The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is performed by management on a quarterly basis. While management uses available information to anticipate credit losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions or the composition of its portfolios. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation's allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Because the Corporation's methodology for maintaining its allowance for credit losses is based on historical experience and trends, current economic information, forecasted data, and management's judgement, a range of estimates for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses may be supportable. Deteriorating economic conditions may lead to further required increases to the allowance; conversely, improvements to economic conditions may warrant further reductions to the allowance. In estimating the allowance for credit losses, management considers the sensitivity of the model and significant judgments and assumptions that could result in an amount that is materially different from management s estimate, including as it relates to qualitative considerations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses totaled 21.4 million and 22.5 million, respectively. Due to the nature and composition of the Bank's lending activities, a significant portion of the allowance for credit losses is allocated to the commercial portfolio, both commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses allocated to the total commercial portfolio was 15.7 million and 17.1 million respectively, or 73.2 and 75.9 , respectively. 
 
 Changes in the FOMC's median forecasted year over year U.S. civilian unemployment rate and the year over year change in U.S. GDP could have a material impact on the model's estimation of the allowance. FOMC projections are sourced from a quarterly Summary of Projections, which accompanies select FOMC meetings. Each participant's projections represent the value to which selected variables would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy, and considers all currently available information. An immediate "shock" or increase of 100 basis points in the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. civilian unemployment, and a decrease of 50 basis points in the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. GDP growth would increase the model's total calculated allowance by 1.3 million, or 6.2 , to 22.8 million as of September 30, 2024, assuming qualitative adjustments are kept at current levels. 
 
 While management has concluded that its current evaluation is reasonable under the circumstances, and that sensitivity analysis is based on a series of hypothetical scenarios not intended to represent management s assumptions or judgement of factors as of September 30, 2024, it has also concluded that differing assumptions could materially impact allowance calculations, either positively or adversely.

In addition to analyzing the Corporation s results on a reported basis, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures because it believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Corporation, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Corporation with the performance of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Refer to pages 78-81 for further explanation and reconciliation of the Corporation s use of non-GAAP measures.

 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 5.7 million, or 1.19 per share, compared to 7.6 million, or 1.61 per share, for the same period in the prior year. Return on average equity for the current quarter was 10.81 , compared to 16.89 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income was attributable to a decrease in non-interest income, an increase in non-interest expense, and an increase in the provision for credit losses, offset by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.8 million, or 3.72 per share, compared to 21.2 million, or 4.48 per share, for the same period in the prior year. Return on average equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.82 , compared to 15.93 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income was attributable to decreases in net interest income and non-interest income, and an increase in non-interest expense, offset by decreases in the provision for credit losses and income tax expense.

Net Interest Income 
 
 The following table presents net interest income for the periods indicated, and the dollar and percent change (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Interest and dividend income 32,362 29,015 3,347 11.5 Interest expense 13,974 10,998 2,976 27.1 Net interest income 18,388 18,017 371 2.1 
 
 Net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings, is the largest contributor to the Corporation s earnings. 
 
 Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.4 million, or 2.1 , to 18.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year, due primarily to increases of 3.6 million in interest income on loans, including fees and 0.3 million in interest income on interest-earning deposits, partially offset by increases of 2.3 million in interest expense on deposits and 0.7 million in interest expense on borrowed funds, and a decrease of 0.5 million in interest and dividend income on taxable securities. 
 
 Interest income on loans, including fees, increased to 28.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 25.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Interest income on loans, including fees, increased primarily due to a 134.3 million increase in average commercial loan balances, compared to the same period in the prior year, and an increase of 36 basis points in the average yield on commercial loans between these periods. The increase in the average balances of commercial loans was primarily due to year over year growth in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan balances, while the increase in the average yield was primarily due to higher origination yields in 2024. Average balances of residential mortgage loans decreased 9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in sales of new originations into the secondary market, while the average yield on residential mortgage loans increased 36 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the higher interest rate environment. Average consumer loan balances decreased 13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower indirect auto loan origination activity during 2024, while the average yield on consumer loans increased 60 basis points, primarily due to runoff of older vintage indirect auto loans, replaced by higher yielding new originations. Interest income on interest-earning deposits increased primarily due to a 21.2 million increase in the average balances of interest-earning deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Interest expense on deposits increased to 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a 44 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits, which included brokered deposits, due to the higher interest rate environment and increased competition, and an increase of 175.6 million in the average balance of customer interest-bearing deposits, primarily due to an increase in average balances of customer time deposits. Both the increase in the average interest rate paid and the average balances of customer interest-bearing deposits were primarily attributable to CD campaigns throughout 2024, as well as a general shift in the deposit mix towards higher cost accounts. The average balances of brokered deposits decreased 123.7 million, while the average interest rate paid on brokered deposits increased nine basis points, compared to the same period in the prior year. The average balances of brokered deposits decreased primarily due to the utilization of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) and FHLBNY term advances in the current quarter, which were not utilized in the same period in the prior year, as well as lower loan growth during the current quarter, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Interest expense on borrowed funds increased to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to a 54.8 million increase in the average balances of borrowed funds, partially offset by a decrease of 17 basis points in the average interest rate paid on borrowed funds for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The composition of borrowed funds reflected the Corporation's shift to the lower cost, short-term funding sources of the BTFP and FHLBNY term advances, partially replacing relatively higher cost FHLBNY overnight advances in the current period. The average balance of FHLBNY overnight advances decreased 17.3 million, and the average interest rate paid on FHLBNY overnight advances decreased 47 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 51 

Interest and dividend income on taxable securities decreased to 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Interest and dividend income on taxable securities decreased primarily due to a 57.6 million decrease in the average balances of taxable securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to paydowns and maturities, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 2.72 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.73 for the same period in the prior year. Average interest-earning assets increased 73.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the sam e period in the prior year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 38 basis points to 4.78 , and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 50 basis points to 2.97 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the higher rate environment as well as a shift in the overall deposit mix to higher cost deposits. 

The following table presents net interest income for the periods indicated, and the dollar and percent change (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Interest and dividend income 94,967 83,041 11,926 14.4 Interest expense 40,729 26,482 14,247 53.8 Net interest income 54,238 56,559 (2,321) (4.1) 
 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 54.2 million compared to 56.6 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 2.3 million, or 4.1 due primarily to an increase of 14.2 million in interest expense, partially offset by an increase of 11.9 million in interest and dividend income. The increase in interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily attributed to increases of 13.3 million in interest expense on deposits and 1.0 million in interest expense on borrowed funds. The increase in interest and dividend income for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily attributed to increases of 12.2 million in interest income on loans, including fees, and 0.6 million in interest income on interest-earning deposits, offset by a decrease of 0.9 million in interest and dividend income on taxable securities. 
 
 Interest expense on deposits increased to 37.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 24.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of 171.2 million in customer time deposits, and a 119 basis points increase in the average interest rates paid on customer time deposits for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in average balances of customer time deposits was primarily attributable to CD campaigns throughout 2024, as well as a shift in deposit demand towards higher cost account types. The increase in the average interest rates paid on customer time deposits was due primarily to the higher interest rate environment, as well as competitive pressures to attract and retain customer time deposits. The average balances of brokered deposits decreased 57.7 million, while the average interest rates paid on brokered deposits increased 26 basis points, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Also contributing to the increase in interest expense on deposits was an increase of 4.5 million in interest expense on savings and money market accounts, due to an increase of 77 basis points in the average interest rates paid, despite a decrease of 38.5 million in the average balances of savings and money market accounts, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest expense paid on interest-bearing demand deposits increased 2.2 million, primarily due to an 89 basis points increase in the average interest rates paid, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased to 2.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 1.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due primarily to a five basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on borrowed funds, and a 24.4 million increase in the average balances of borrowed funds for the current nine months, when compared to the same period in the prior year, to fund loan growth. 
 
 52 

Interest income on loans, including fees, increased to 83.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 71.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest income on loans, including fees, was mostly attributable to an increase of 143.6 million in the average balances of commercial loans, and a 42 basis points increase in the average yield of the commercial loan portfolio, primarily due to increases in average interest rates on new loan originations. Average yields on the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios also increased by 27 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, The increase in average yield on the residential mortgage loan portfolio was primarily due to higher origination yields during 2024, while the increase in average yield on the consumer loan portfolio was primarily attributable to rate increases on variable rate home equity products, and the relatively fast turnover rate within the indirect auto portfolio and higher originations yields during 2024. The increase in interest income on interest-earning deposits was primarily attributed to a 17.6 million increase in the average balances of interest-earning deposits. 
 
 Interest and dividend income on taxable securities decreased to 9.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 10.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in interest and dividend income on taxable securities was mostly attributable to a 59.7 million decrease in the average balances of taxable securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in the average balances of taxable securities was mostly attributable to paydowns on securities within the available for sale portfolio. 
 
 Fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 2.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.91 for the same period in the prior year. Average interest-earning assets increased 83.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 45 basis points, to 4.72 , while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increas ed 89 basis points, to 2.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year.

Changes Due to Rate and Volume 
 
 Net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes. The tables below illustrate the extent to which changes in interest rates and the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Corporation s interest income and interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Information is provided in each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rates (changes in rates multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net changes. For purpose of these tables, changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate. Due to the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the periods analyzed, it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates. In addition, average interest-earning assets include nonaccrual loans and taxable equivalent adjustments were made.

Provision for credit losses 
 
 Management has established and maintains a methodology for determining and adjusting its allowance for credit losses in conformity with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, adopted by the Corporation on January 1, 2023. The allowance is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis and changes in the required allowance are recorded through income as a provision (credit). The quantitative portion of the model is significantly influenced by changes in projected economic conditions, as well as changes in the composition of the numerous loan portfolio segments. Qualitative adjustments reflect the degree to which management anticipates future outcomes may differ from those projected by the quantitative model. 
 
 The provision for credit losses increased 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to unfavorable changes in FOMC forecasted variables in the third quarter of 2024, compared to favorable changes to forecasts in the third quarter of 2023, as well as a decline in modeled prepayment speeds. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 0.3 million in net charge offs in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a credit of 0.6 million, compared to a provision of 1.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The 1.6 million decrease in the provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the annual review and update to the loss drivers used in the Bank's CECL model, which was reflected in the Corporation's allowance for credit losses in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by unfavorable changes in economic forecasts and declines in modeled prepayment speeds. Loss drivers are the economic variables used when making forward looking projections to determine correlations between changes in economic variables and changes in historical loss experience. Recalibration of the loss drivers resulted in a decline in baseline loss rates utilized by the model, however the economic variables used were unchanged. 
 
 Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.1 million, compared to 0.4 million for the same period in the prior year. Net charge-offs for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily concentrated in the consumer indirect auto portfolio. 
 
 57 

Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.6 million, compared to 0.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were concentrated in the consumer indirect auto portfolio. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to charge-offs in the consumer indirect auto portfolio, and a 0.2 million charge-off of a commercial and industrial loan. 

Non-interest income 
 
 The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated, and the dollar and percent change (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change WMG fee income 2,991 2,533 458 18.1 Service charges on deposit accounts 1,016 1,018 (2) (0.2) Interchange revenue from debit card transactions 1,123 1,141 (18) (1.6) Changes in fair value of equity investments 118 (68) 186 273.5 Net gains on sales of loans held for sale 91 67 24 35.8 Net gains (losses) on sales of other real estate owned (19) (19) N/M Income from bank owned life insurance 10 11 (1) (9.1) CFS fee and commission income 306 243 63 25.9 Other 283 2,863 (2,580) (90.1) Total non-interest income 5,919 7,808 (1,889) (24.2) 

Total non-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in other non-interest income, partially offset by increases in WMG fee income and changes in fair value of equity investments. 
 
 Other Non-Interest Income 
 The decrease in other non-interest income can primarily be attributed to the recognition of the employee retention tax credit (ERTC) in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 WMG Fee Income 
 The increase in WMG fee income can primarily be attributed to an increase in the market value of total assets under management or administration and fee rate increases effective in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Changes in Fair Value Equity Investments 
 The increase in changes in fair value of equity investments can primarily be attributed to an increase in the market value of assets held for the Corporation's deferred compensation plan.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change WMG fee income 8,554 7,716 838 10.9 Service charges on deposit accounts 2,929 2,918 11 0.4 Interchange revenue from debit card transactions 3,327 3,468 (141) (4.1) Changes in fair value of equity investments 233 (99) 332 335.4 Net gains on sales of loans held for sale 162 90 72 80.0 Net gains (losses) on sales of other real estate owned (22) 14 (36) (257.1) Income from bank owned life insurance 29 32 (3) (9.4) CFS fee and commission income 787 749 38 5.1 Other 1,175 3,790 (2,615) (69.0) Total non-interest income 17,174 18,678 (1,504) (8.1) 
 
 Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.5 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in other non-interest income and interchange revenue from debit card transactions, partially offset by increases in WMG fee income and changes in fair value of equity investments. 

Other Non-Interest Income 
 The decrease in other non-interest income can primarily be attributed to the recognition of the employee retention tax credit (ERTC) in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Interchange Revenue from Debit Card Transactions 
 The decrease in interchange revenue from debit card transactions was primarily due to a decrease in client transaction volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 WMG Fee Income 
 The increase in WMG fee income can primarily be attributed to an increase in the market value of total assets under management or administration and fee rate increases effective in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Changes in Fair Value of Equity Investments 
 The increase in the changes in fair value of equity investments was primarily due to an increase in the market value of assets held related to the Corporation's deferred compensation plan, related to improvements in the financial markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was also partially due to a decline in the fair value of a particular equity investment held by the Corporation during the same period in the prior year.

Non-interest expense 
 
 The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated, and the dollar and percent change (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Compensation expense: Salaries and wages 7,168 6,542 626 9.6 Pension and other employee benefits 1,627 1,979 (352) (17.8) Other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits (227) (174) (53) (30.5) Total compensation expense 8,568 8,347 221 2.6 Non-compensation expense: Net occupancy 1,422 1,337 85 6.4 Furniture and equipment 402 353 49 13.9 Data processing 2,567 2,480 87 3.5 Professional services 522 554 (32) (5.8) Marketing and advertising 210 218 (8) (3.7) Other real estate owned expenses 55 10 45 N/M FDIC insurance 524 525 (1) (0.2) Loan expenses 353 249 104 41.8 Other 1,887 1,595 292 18.3 Total non-compensation expense 7,942 7,321 621 8.5 Total non-interest expense 16,510 15,668 842 5.4 
 
 Total non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to increases in total compensation expense and non-compensation expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense to average assets was 2.39 , compared to 2.33 for the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Compensation expense 
 The increase in compensation expense for the current period, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages, partially offset by a decrease in pension and other employee benefits. The increase in salaries and wages can be primarily attributed to an increase in base salaries, including additional staffing for the Corporation's newly opened Western New York regional banking center, as well as an increase in the market value of the assets held for the Corporation's deferred compensation plan. The decrease in pension and other employee benefits can be primarily attributed to a decrease in employee healthcare expenses in the current quarter. 
 
 Non-compensation expense 
 The increase in non-compensation expense for the current period, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to increases in other non-interest expense and loan expenses. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in supplies and postage expenses, and losses recognized on the sale of repossessed vehicles in the current quarter. The increase in loan expenses can be primarily attributed to legal expenses related to various loan transactions.

The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated, and the dollar and percent change (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Compensation expense: Salaries and wages 21,007 20,029 978 4.9 Pension and other employee benefits 5,787 5,467 320 5.9 Other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits (691) (522) (169) (32.4) Total compensation expense 26,103 24,974 1,129 4.5 Non-compensation expense: Net occupancy 4,360 4,242 118 2.8 Furniture and equipment 1,197 1,232 (35) (2.8) Data processing 7,437 7,334 103 1.4 Professional services 1,639 1,596 43 2.7 Marketing and advertising 943 720 223 31.0 Other real estate owned expenses 116 49 67 136.7 FDIC insurance 1,617 1,608 9 0.6 Loan expenses 808 789 19 2.4 Other 5,207 4,873 334 6.9 Total non-compensation expense 23,324 22,443 881 3.9 Total non-interest expense 49,427 47,417 2,010 4.2 
 
 Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to increases in total compensation expense and total non-compensation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-interest expense to average assets was 2.41 and 2.39 , respectively. 
 
 Compensation expense 
 The increase in compensation expense for the current period, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and pension and other employee benefits, offset by a decrease in other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits. The increase in salaries and wages included additional staffing for the Corporation's newly opened Western New York regional banking center, as well as an increase in the market value of the assets held for the Corporation's deferred compensation plan, which offset savings realized due to outsourcing, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in pension and other employee benefits was primarily attributable to an increase in employee healthcare expenses for the current period, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits was primarily due to actuarial adjustments related to the Corporation's pension plans. 
 
 Non-compensation expense 
 The increase in non-compensation expense was primarily due to increases in other non-interest expense, marketing and advertising, net occupancy expense, and data processing expense. The increase in other non-interest expense was due to modest increases amongst most expense categories, including supplies and postage expense, charitable donations and corporate travel, when compared to the same period in the prior year. Marketing and advertising expenses increased during the current period compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to expenditures related to a deposit account promotion related to the Bank's 190th anniversary, CD campaigns, and an increase in advertising activity in the current period. The increase in net occupancy expense was primarily due to an increase in building maintenance and property insurance expenses, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in data processing expenses was primarily due to the addition of various new contracts and an increase in cybersecurity software expense, offset by a decrease in certain software maintenance and processing expenses, when compared to the same period in the prior year.

 Income tax expense for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.5 million and 2.1 million, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense was due primarily to a decrease of 2.5 million in income before income tax expense. The effective income tax rate decreased from 21.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

The following table presents income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the periods indicated, and the dollar and percent change (in thousands):

 Income tax expense for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.8 million and 5.7 million, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense was due primarily to a decrease of 4.3 million in income before income tax expense. The effective income tax rate increased from 21.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Financial Condition 
 
 The following table presents selected financial information as of the dates indicated, and the dollar and percent change (dollars in thousands): 
 ASSETS September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Change Total cash and cash equivalents 80,440 36,847 43,593 118.3 Total investment securities, FHLB and FRB stock 562,665 593,322 (30,657) (5.2) Loans, net of deferred loan fees 2,028,954 1,972,664 56,290 2.9 Allowance for credit losses (21,441) (22,517) (1,076) (4.8) Loans, net 2,007,513 1,950,147 57,366 2.9 Goodwill and other intangible assets, net 21,824 21,824 Other assets 101,773 108,389 (6,616) (6.1) Total assets 2,774,215 2,710,529 63,686 2.3 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Total deposits 2,451,121 2,429,427 21,694 0.9 Advances and other debt 53,757 34,970 18,787 53.7 Other liabilities 48,683 50,891 (2,208) (4.3) Total liabilities 2,553,561 2,515,288 38,273 1.5 Total shareholders equity 220,654 195,241 25,413 13.0 Total liabilities and shareholders equity 2,774,215 2,710,529 63,686 2.3 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The increase in cash and cash equivalents can be attributed to changes in loans, deposits, borrowings, and securities. 
 
 Investment securities 
 The decrease in investment securities can mostly be attributed to 42.3 million in paydowns and maturities in the securities available for sale portfolio, primarily attributable to paydowns on mortgage-backed securities and SBA pooled-loan securities, and an increase in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio of 14.7 million, due to favorable changes in interest rates. 
 
 Loans, net 
 The increase in loans, net of deferred loan fees, can primarily be attributed to increases of 52.0 million in commercial mortgages and 24.9 million in commercial and industrial loans, offset by decreases of 20.9 million in indirect consumer loans and 3.9 million in residential mortgages. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The decrease in the allowance for credit losses can primarily be attributed to the annual review and update of loss drivers used in the Bank's CECL model. The annual update to the loss drivers, which were applied beginning in the first quarter of 2024, resulted in a decline in baseline loss rates. Partially offsetting these declines were comparatively weaker FOMC projections for economic variables used in the Bank's CECL model as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, declines in prepayment speeds between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, and loan growth during 2024. 
 
 Other Assets 
 The decrease in other assets can primarily be attributed to decreases of 4.2 million in interest rate swap assets, due to a decrease in the market value of swaps, and 3.8 million in deferred tax assets, due to improvements in the market value of the available for sale securities portfolio. 
 63 

Deposits 
 The increase in deposits can primarily be attributed to increases of 102.8 million in customer time deposits and 58.2 million in interest-bearing demand deposits, offset by decreases of 103.3 million in brokered deposits and 37.0 million in non interest-bearing demand deposits. In addition, insured money market deposits increased 7.2 million and savings deposits decreased 6.2 million. 
 
 Advances and Other Debt 
 The increase in advances and other debt can primarily be attributed to a 50.0 million advance from the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), and an increase of 0.7 million in finance lease obligations, offset by a decrease of 31.9 million in FHLBNY overnight advances. 
 
 Other liabilities 
 The decrease in other liabilities can primarily be attributed to a decrease of 4.2 million in interest rate swap liabilities, primarily due to a decrease in the market value of swaps, partially offset by increases in interest payable on borrowed funds of 1.7 million and interest payable on deposits of 1.2 million. 
 
 Shareholders equity 
 Shareholders equity was 220.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 195.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase can primarily be attributed to an increase of 13.3 million in retained earnings, and a decrease of 10.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in retained earnings can primarily be attributed to net income of 17.8 million, offset by 4.4 million in dividends declared, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss can primarily be attributed to an increase in the fair market value of the available for sale securities portfolio due to favorable changes in market interest rates. 
 
 Assets under management or administration 
 The market value of total assets under management or administration in WMG was 2.316 billion as of September 30, 2024, including 367.8 million of assets held under management or administration for the Corporation, compared to 2.242 billion as of December 31, 2023, including 381.3 million of assets held under management or administration for the Corporation, an increase of 73.2 million, or 3.3 , primarily attributable to market improvements during 2024. 

Securities 
 
 The Corporation s Funds Management Policy includes an investment policy that in general, requires debt securities purchased for the bond portfolio to carry a minimum agency rating of "Baa." After an independent credit analysis is performed, the policy also allows the Corporation to purchase local municipal obligations that are not rated. The Corporation intends to maintain a reasonable level of securities to provide adequate liquidity and in order to have securities available to pledge to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements, and other types of transactions. Fluctuations in the fair value of the Corporation s securities relate primarily to changes in interest rates. Marketable securities are generally classified as Available for Sale, while certain investments in local municipal obligations are classified as Held to Maturity. 
 The available for sale segment of the securities portfolio totaled 554.6 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 29.4 million, or 5.0 , from 584.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease can mostly be attributed to 42.3 million in paydowns and maturities. The fair value of the portfolio increased 14.7 million, due to favorable changes in interest rates during the current period. The held to maturity securities portfolio consists of obligations of political subdivisions in the Corporation s market areas. These securities totaled 0.7 million and 0.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Non-marketable equity securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include shares of FRBNY stock and FHLBNY stock, carried at their cost. FRBNY stock and FHLBNY stock were 1.9 million and 2.3 million respectively as of September 30, 2024, and 1.9 million and 3.6 million respectively as of December 31, 2023. The fair value of these securities is assumed to approximate their cost. The investment in these stocks is regulated by regulatory policies of the respective institutions.

 Portfolio loans totaled 2.029 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 56.3 million, or 2.9 , from 1.973 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in loans can primarily be attributed to increases of 52.0 million in commercial mortgage loans and 24.9 million in commercial and industrial loans, offset by decreases of 20.9 million in indirect consumer loans and 3.9 million in residential mortgages. 
 
 Commercial lending continues to be a primary driver of asset growth for the Corporation, as demand for project financing remains robust, particularly in the Capital Bank division. As of September 30, 2024, total commercial real estate loans, inclusive of construction loans, in the Capital Bank division grew by 46.7 million. Commercial real estate loan growth in the Canal Bank division was 6.8 million, while commercial real estate balances contracted by 1.4 million in the Chemung Canal division. Growth in commercial and industrial loans between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 was also concentrated in the Capital Bank division, increasing by 19.6 million. Commercial and industrial loan growth in the Canal Bank and Chemung Canal divisions were 5.2 million and 0.1 million, respectively. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans totaled 274.1 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.9 million, or 1.4 , compared to December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 26.3 million in residential mortgages were originated, of which 8.5 million were sold in the secondary market to Freddie Mac and FHLBNY. Demand for residential mortgage originations continues to be weaker as a result of the higher interest rate environment and lower market mobility due to many borrowers securing lower interest rates in prior years. Indirect consumer loans totaled 189.5 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 20.9 million, or 9.9 , from December 31, 2023 as portfolio turnover exceeded total origination activity.

Commercial real estate lending represented the largest portion of the Corporation's loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate lending is comprised of the "Construction" and "Commercial mortgage, other" segments of the loan portfolio, as presented in Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total commercial real estate loans totaled 1.175 billion and 1.123 billion, respectively. Management evaluates the risk inherent in its portfolio of commercial real estate loans using a variety of metrics, including but not limited to type, geography, collateral, and borrower or sponsor industry. 
 
 The table below presents commercial real estate loans by type and percentage as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

 (1) 1-4 Family residential loans included in the commercial real estate portfolio segment are comprised of properties whose primary purpose is to generate rental income for the borrower, but are not considered multifamily properties within the FFIEC's Call Report definition of a multifamily property. This may include single family residences, duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes. 
 
 Commercial real estate loans are primarily made within the counties comprising the geographic footprint of the Corporation's physical branch network, as well as to borrowers whose business interests include projects that may be located in counties that are geographically contiguous with the Corporation's physical footprint. The location of collateral securing commercial real estate loans typically mirrors the location of the properties being financed. However, certain commercial real estate loans are secured by property other than the property being financed, and therefore the geographic location of collateral may differ from that of the financed property.

The Corporation closely monitors economic and credit trends for the industries in which its commercial real estate borrowers are involved. Property types are designated based on the purpose of the collateral securing commercial real estate loans. The table below presents commercial real estate loans by borrower industry and percentage as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

 Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities, which may cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Industries are identified using NAICS codes, and the Corporation monitors specific NAICS industry classificat ions of commercial loans to identify concentrations of greater than 10 .0 of total loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial loans to borrowers involved in the real estate and real estate rental and leasing businesses were 51.0 and 49.5 of total loans, respectively. No other concentration of loans existed in the commercial loan portfolio in excess of 10.0 of total loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The Corporation has reporting systems to monitor: (i) loan origination and concentrations, (ii) delinquent loans, (iii) non-performing assets, including non-performing loans, certain loans made with modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, other real estate owned, and repossessed vehicles (iv) loans analyzed on an individual basis for credit risk, and (v) potential problem loans. Management reviews these systems on a regular basis. 
 
 Non-Performing Assets 
 
 Non-performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned that has been acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations or upon foreclosure, and repossessed vehicles. Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated troubled debt restructuring accounting guidance. Prior to adoption, nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings were considered to be non-performing assets. The Corporation closely monitors loan modifications made to borrowers deemed to be experiencing financial difficulty in accordance with ASU 2022-02. As of September 30, 2024, there were four loans being monitored under ASU 2022-02 guidance, two of which were accruing, and two of which were nonaccrual. 
 68 

Past due status on all loans is based on the contractual terms of the loan. It is generally the Corporation's policy that a loan 90 days past due be placed on nonaccrual status unless factors exist that would eliminate the need to classify a loan as such. A loan may also be designated as nonaccrual at any time if payment of principal or interest in full is not expected due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. At the time loans are placed into nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously accrued interest is reversed. All payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal. Loans are considered for return to accrual status when they become current as to principal and interest and remain current for a period of six consecutive months or when, in the opinion of management, the Corporation expects to receive all of its original principal and interest. In the case of nonaccrual loans where a portion of the loan has been charged off, the remaining balance is kept in nonaccrual status until the entire principal balance has been recovered. 

The following table summarizes the Corporation's non-performing assets (dollars in thousands): 
 NON-PERFORMING ASSETS September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total non-performing loans 10,545 10,411 Other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles 589 326 Total non-performing assets 11,134 10,737 Ratio of non-performing loans to total loans 0.52 0.53 Ratio of non-performing assets to total assets 0.40 0.40 Ratio of allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 203.33 216.28 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (1)

 (1) Not included in non-performing assets above . 

Non-Performing Loans and Assets 
 Non-performing loans totaled 10.5 million, or 0.52 of total loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10.4 million, or 0.53 of total loans as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets, which are comprised of non-performing loans, other real estate owned, and repossessed vehicles were 11.1 million, or 0.40 of total assets as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10.7 million, or 0.40 of total assets as of December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans was primarily attributable to the addition of four commercial real estate loans added to nonaccrual during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, totaling 3.4 million, primarily offset by the payoff of a nonaccrual commercial real estate loan totaling 1.9 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, as well as net paydown activity on other nonaccrual loans. The increase in non-performing assets can primarily be attributed to the increases in non-performing loans and other real estate owned. 
 
 Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 The Corporation works closely with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties to identify viable solutions that minimize the potential for loss. The Corporation monitors modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in which contractual cash flows are directly impacted. Modifications included under this guidance include principal reductions, reductions in effective interest rates, term extensions, significant payment delays, or a combination thereof. ASU 2022-02 was implemented on January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis, and as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had four loans modified under this accounting guidance, which consisted of term extensions on two commercial and industrial loans and one home equity loan, and a payment delay on one residential mortgage. As of September 30, 2024, one of the aforementioned commercial and industrial loans given an extension of six months experienced a payment default, while the remainder of the modified loans were performing under their modified terms. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, two commercial mortgages previously modified under ASU 2022-02, with total balances of 2.2 million, were paid off. 
 69 

Individually Analyzed Loans 
 The Corporation analyzes loans on an individual basis when management determines that a loan no longer exhibits risk characteristics consistent with those in its designated pool of loans, in accordance with the Corporation's CECL methodology. The amortized cost basis of individually analyzed loans as of September 30, 2024 totaled 8.2 million, compared to 8.0 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 The majority of the Corporation's individually analyzed loans are secured and measured for credit loss based on collateral evaluations. It is the Corporation's policy to obtain updated appraisals by independent third parties on loans secured by real estate at the time a loan is determined to require individual analysis. A measurement is performed based upon the most recent appraisal on file to determine the amount of any specific allocation or charge-off. In determining the amount of any specific allocation or charge-off, the Corporation will make adjustments to reflect the estimated costs to sell the property. Upon receipt and review of updated appraisals, an additional measurement is performed to determine if any adjustments are necessary to reflect proper provisioning or charge-offs. Individually analyzed loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if any changes in credit quality or market conditions would require additional specific allocations or recognition of additional charge-offs. Real estate values in each of the Corporation's market areas have remained stable in recent periods. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using (i) an appraisal, (ii) net book value of the collateral per the borrower s financial statements, or (iii) accounts receivable aging reports, that may be adjusted based on management s knowledge of the client and client s business. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses is an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb the estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in assets exhibiting credit risk as of the measurement date. The allowance is in conformity with the requirements established by ASC 326 -Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , and is a departure from the allowance for loan losses (ALLL) that the Corporation previously estimated using an incurred loss methodology. The allowance covers loans, unfunded commitments, and certain debt securities exhibiting credit risk potential, and incorporates both quantitative and qualitative components. 
 Loans are analyzed on either an individual basis or a pooled basis, determined by risk characteristics. It is the Corporation's policy to analyze all nonaccrual commercial loans on an individual basis, unless specific circumstances warrant that the loan should continue to be analyzed on a pooled basis. Management may also individually analyze accruing loans based on specific risk characteristics or fact patterns. Individually analyzed loans are primarily valued based on the collateral method, however, certain loans may be valued using a cash flow analysis. Pooled loans are segmented based on groups of assigned FFIEC call codes, in order to provide enough granularity to meaningfully capture the risk profile of each instrument, yet broad enough to accurately allow for the application of certain pool-level assumptions. 
 Quantitative analysis is based on an estimated discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) performed at the loan level. The modeled reserve requirement equals the difference between the book balance of the instrument at the measurement date and the present value of assumed cash flows for the life of the loan. The underlying assumptions of the DCF are based on the relationship between a projected value of an economic indicator, and the implied historical loss experience amongst a group of curated peers. The Corporation utilized a regression analysis to determine suitable loss drivers for each pool of loans. Based on these results, a probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD), is assigned to each potential value of an economic indicator for each pool of loans, and is then applied to the portfolio to derive the statistical loss implications thereof. A hypothetical loss for each period of the DCF, as well as implied recovery of past losses, is incorporated into the DCF. The Corporation relies on FOMC data as the source for its readily available and reasonable economic forecast. The forecasted values are applied over a four-quarter period, and revert back to the historic mean of a lookback period over an eight-quarter period, on a straight-line basis. 
 Qualitative adjustments represent management's expectation of certain risks not being captured entirely in the quantitative portion of the model. Qualitative adjustment rates are applied to each instrument within a pool on a consistent basis. Factors considered as part of the qualitative adjustment analysis include economic considerations not captured by the model, changes in conditions within the Bank such as lending standards, personnel, and concentrations of credit, among others, as well as other external factors such as changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape. 
 70 

The allowance for credit losses is adjusted though a provision (credit) for credit losses, which is charged to operations. Separate provision accounts have been established for on-balance sheet credit exposures and off-balance sheet credit exposures, and are combined in the line item provision (credit) for credit losses on the Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes the collectability of all or a portion of the principal is unlikely. Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is performed on a periodic basis and takes into consideration such factors as the outcomes of quantitative analysis, a review of specific individually analyzed loans, and relevant qualitative adjustments. While management uses available information to recognize losses on credits, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changing economic conditions or portfolio composition. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation's allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 The allowance for credit losses was 21.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and 22.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was 203.33 of non-performing loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 216.28 as of December 31, 2023. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.06 as of September 30, 2024 and 1.14 as of December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 0.6 million and 0.8 million, respectively. Net charge-off activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected activity in the indirect auto segment of the consumer loan portfolio, while activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected a partial charge off on a commercial and industrial loan, as well as charge-off activity in the indirect auto segment of the consumer loan portfolio. 
 The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily attributable to the annual review and update performed on the loss drivers used as the basis for the Bank's CECL model. Loss drivers are the economic variables used to make forward looking credit loss projections. Recalibration of the loss drivers resulted in a decline in the baseline loss rates used in the CECL model, however, the composition of economic variables selected as loss drivers did not change as a result of this update. Partially offsetting decreases related to the annual update were comparatively weaker FOMC economic forecasts in the current year period, a decline in modeled prepayment speeds, and loan growth during 2024.

Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Vehicles 
 
 OREO totaled 0.5 million as of September 30, 2024, and 0.3 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. There were three residential mortgage properties and four home equity loan properties added to other real estate owned in the first nine months of 2024. There were two residential mortgage properties and three home equity properties sold from other real estate owned in the first nine months of 2024, resulting in a net loss on sales of 23 thousand. The Corporation had 0.1 million in repossessed vehicles as of September 30, 2024, which is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and is a component of non-performing assets. 

Deposits 
 
 The table below summarizes the Corporation s deposit composition by segment as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and the dollar and percent change from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 DEPOSITS September 30, 2024 v. December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount of Total Amount of Total Change Change Non interest-bearing demand deposits 616,126 25.1 653,166 26.9 (37,040) (5.7) Interest-bearing demand deposits 349,383 14.3 291,138 12.0 58,245 20.0 Money market deposits 630,870 25.7 623,714 25.7 7,156 1.1 Savings deposits 242,911 9.9 249,144 10.3 (6,233) (2.5) Certificates of deposit 250,000 or less 444,861 18.1 365,058 15.0 79,803 21.9 Certificates of deposit greater than 250,000 96,481 4.0 76,804 3.1 19,677 25.6 Brokered deposits 39,500 1.6 142,776 5.9 (103,276) (72.3) Other time deposits 30,989 1.3 27,627 1.1 3,362 12.2 Total 2,451,121 100.0 2,429,427 100.0 21,694 0.9 
 
 Deposits totaled 2.451 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2.429 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 21.7 million, or 0.9 . The increase was primarily attributable to increases of 102.8 million in customer time deposits and 58.2 million in interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by decreases of 103.3 million in brokered deposits and 37.0 million in non interest-bearing demand deposits. Additionally, insured money market deposits increased 7.2 million, and savings deposits decreased 6.2 million. 
 The growth in customer deposits was due primarily to increases of 56.1 million in public deposits, 40.6 million in consumer deposits, 10.3 million in ICS deposits, 12.8 million in CDARS deposits, and 5.2 million in commercial deposits. As of September 30, 2024, demand deposit and money market deposits comprised 65.1 of total deposits compared to 64.5 as of December 31, 2023. The aggregate amount of the Corporation's outstanding uninsured deposits was 28.9 and 27.0 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The table below presents the Corporation's deposits balances by Bank division (in thousands):

 All deposits, excluding those originated by the Capital Bank and Canal Bank divisions.

In addition to consumer, commercial, and public deposits, other sources of funds include reciprocal deposits. The Regulatory Relief Act changed the definition of brokered deposits, such that subject to certain conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC s brokered-deposit regulations. This applies to the Corporation's participation in the CDARS and ICS programs. The CDARS and ICS programs involve a network of financial institutions that exchange funds among members in order to ensure FDIC insurance coverage on customer deposits above the single institution limit. The CDARS and ICS reciprocal program uses a sophisticated matching system, where funds are exchanged on a dollar-for-dollar basis, so that the equivalent of an original deposit comes back to the originating institution. Additionally, the CDARS and ICS One-Way Buy programs allow the Corporation to obtain wholesale brokered deposits through the system. Deposits obtained through the CDARS and ICS reciprocal programs were 448.5 million and 425.5 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Brokered deposits, which include funds obtained through brokers or the CDARS and ICS One-Way Buy program, were 39.5 million and 142.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Corporation s deposit strategy is to fund the Bank with stable, low-cost deposits, primarily checking account deposits and other low interest-bearing deposit accounts. A checking account is the driver of a banking relationship and consumers consider the bank where they have their checking account as their primary bank. These customers will typically turn to their primary bank first when in need of other financial services. Strategies that have been developed and implemented to generate these deposits include: (i) acquiring deposits by entering new markets through branch acquisitions or de novo branching, (ii) an annual checking account marketing campaign, (iii) training branch employees to identify and meet client financial needs with Bank products and services, (iv) linking business and consumer loans to the customer's primary checking account at the Bank, (v) aggressively promoting direct deposit of client s payroll checks or benefit checks and (vi) constantly monitoring the Corporation s pricing strategies to ensure competitive products and services. The Corporation also considers brokered deposits to be an element of its deposit strategy and uses brokered deposits as a secondary source of funding to support growth. 

Borrowings 
 Borrowings increased 18.8 million to 53.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to a 50.0 million advance from the Federal Reserve, as the Corporation took advantage of lower interest rates offered by the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), offset by a decrease of 31.9 million in FHLBNY overnight advances compared to December 31, 2023. A 30.0 million FHLBNY short-term advance matured in September 2024. There were no outstanding FHLBNY or FRBNY term advances as of December 31, 2023. 

Shareholders Equity 
 Total shareholders' equity increased by 25.4 million from 195.2 million as of December 31, 2023 to 220.7 million as of September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in retained earnings and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in retained earnings of 13.3 million was due primarily to earnings of 17.8 million, offset by 4.4 million in dividends declared during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 10.9 million can be mostly attributed to an increase in the fair market value of the available for sale securities portfolio, primarily due to favorable changes in interest rates. Treasury stock decreased by 0.5 million, primarily due to the issuance of shares related to the Corporation's employee benefit plans and grants issued under the Corporation's stock compensation plan. The total shareholders equity to total assets ratio was 7.95 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 7.20 as of December 31, 2023. The tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.22 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 6.45 as of December 31, 2023. Book value per share increased to 46.22 as of September 30, 2024 from 41.07 as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Bank is subject to the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve, which establishes a framework for the classification of financial institutions into five categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized and critically under-capitalized. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s capital ratios were in excess of those required to be considered well-capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines. 
 When shares of the Corporation become available in the market, the Corporation may purchase them after careful consideration of the Corporation s liquidity and capital positions. Purchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. On January 8, 2021, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program. Under the new repurchase program, the Corporation may repurchase up to 250,000 shares of its common stock, or approximately 5 of its then outstanding shares. The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market or privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. No shares were repurchased in the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation repurchased a total of 49,184 shares of common stock at a total cost of 2.0 million under the repurchase program, at the weighted average cost of 40.42 per share. Remaining buyback authority under the share repurchase program was 200,816 shares as of September 30, 2024.

Liquidity 
 Liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of deposit clients and borrowers, as well as the operating, investing, and financing activities of the Corporation. The Corporation uses a variety of resources to meet its liquidity needs. These include short term investments, cash flow from lending and investing activities, core-deposit growth and non-core funding sources, such as time deposits of 250,000 or more, brokered deposits, FHLBNY and FRB advances, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 
 The Corporation has a detailed Funds Management Policy that includes sections on liquidity measurement and management, and a Liquidity Contingency Plan that provides for the prompt and comprehensive response to unexpected demands for liquidity. This policy and plan are established and revised as needed by the management and Board ALCO committees. The ALCO is responsible for measuring liquidity, establishing liquidity targets and implementing strategies to achieve selected targets. The ALCO is responsible for coordinating activities across the Corporation to ensure that prudent levels of contingent or standby liquidity are available at all times. Based upon this ongoing assessment of liquidity considerations, management believes the Corporation s sources of funding meet anticipated funding needs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents balance was 80.4 million. The Corporation also maintains an investment portfolio of securities available for sale, comprised primarily of mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Gov't Treasury securities, Small Business Administration loan pools, and municipal bonds. Although this portfolio generates interest income for the Corporation, it also serves as an available source of liquidity and capital if the need should arise. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation's investment in securities available for sale was 554.6 million, 256.1 million of which was not pledged as collateral. 
 
 The Corporation is a member of the FHLBNY, which allows it to access borrowings to enhance management's ability to satisfy future liquidity needs. The Bank had pledged a total of 248.3 million and 254.6 million of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans under a blanket lien arrangement, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as collateral for future borrowings. Based on this available collateral and securities also held as collateral, the Corporation was eligible to borrow up to a total of 224.2 million and 225.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank had no outstanding FHLBNY borrowings as of September 30, 2024, and 31.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The Bank's unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York was 224.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings may be used on a short-terms basis for liquidity purposes or on a long-term basis to fund asset growth. 
 Uninsured deposits totaled 708.9 million as of September 30, 2024, and 655.7 million as of December 31, 2023, which included 216.2 million and 153.2 million of municipal deposits that were collateralized by pledged assets when appropriate, respectively. The Corporation considers the level of uninsured deposits to be an important factor when considering liquidity management and strategic decisions due to their fluidity. 
 The Corporation also considers brokered deposits to be an element of its deposit strategy and anticipates that it may continue utilizing brokered deposits as a secondary source of funding to support growth. Brokered deposits may be used on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes or on a long-term basis to fund asset growth. Brokered deposits were 39.5 million and 142.8 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, brokered deposits carried terms between 2 and 48 months. The Corporation also had a total of 75.0 million of unsecured lines of credit with five different financial institutions, all of which were available as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Also available to the Corporation is the Discount Window Lending provided by the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 On March 12, 2023, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, and FDIC jointly announced a new liquidity program, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), in response to the failure of two banks earlier that week. Under the BTFP, institutions could pledge certain securities (i.e., securities eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve Banks in open market operations) for the par value of the securities at a borrowing rate of ten basis points over the one-year overnight index swap rate. Certain U.S. federally insured depository institutions were eligible to participate in the BTFP. In January 2024, the Corporation utilized the BTFP, with an advance of 50.0 million, at an interest rate of 4.91 . No new borrowings could be made under the BTFP after March 11, 2024. This advance was repaid by the Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2024 without prepayment penalty.

Consolidated Cash Flows Analysis 
 
 The table below summarizes the Corporation's cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS (in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 23,580 27,261 Net cash used in investing activities (14,840) (53,842) Net cash provided by financing activities 34,853 46,292 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 43,593 19,711 
 
 Operating activities 
 The Corporation believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances, and its ability to generate cash through short-term and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund the Corporation s operating liquidity needs. Cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from net income after non-cash operating adjustments. 
 
 Investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from a net increase in loans, offset by maturities and principal paydowns on securities available for sale. 
 
 Financing activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 primarily resulted from a term advance from the Federal Reserve BTFP and a net increase in deposits. Cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months of 2023 primarily resulted from a net increase in deposits, including brokered deposits, offset by net payments of overnight advances held at the end of the period. 

Capital Resources 
 
 The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. As a result of the Regulatory Relief Act, the FRB amended its small bank holding company and savings and loan holding company policy statement to provide that holding companies with consolidated assets of less than 3.0 billion that are (i) not engaged in significant non-banking activities, (ii) do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and (iii) do not have a material amount of SEC-registered debt or equity securities, other than trust preferred securities, that contribute to an organization s complexity, are not subject to regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Under Basel III rules, the Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is 2.50 . Organizations that fail to maintain the minimum capital conservation buffer could face restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities and changes in the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan and other benefit plans are not included in calculating regulatory capital. 
 
 Pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the FRB finalized a rule that established a community bank leverage ratio (tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets) at 9 for institutions under 10 billion in assets that such institutions may elect to utilize in lieu of the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio and certain other qualifying criteria will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized. The new rule took effect on January 1, 2020. The Bank has not elected to use the community bank leverage ratio. 
 
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation is no longer subject to FRB consolidated capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies, which are similar to those applicable to the Bank, until it reaches 3.0 billion in assets. 
 
 76 

As of September 30, 2024, the most recent notification from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank's capital category. 
 
 The regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were calculated under Basel III rules. There is no threshold for well-capitalized status for bank holding companies. 
 
 The Corporation and the Bank s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands, except ratio data):

Dividend Restrictions 
 
 The Corporation s principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements in the table above. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank could, without prior approval, declare dividends of approximately 54.8 million. 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
 
 Please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting standards. 

Explanation and Reconciliation of the Corporation s Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 The Corporation prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 7 13. That presentation provides the reader with an understanding of the Corporation s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Corporation s performance with other companies GAAP financial statements. 
 
 In addition to analyzing the Corporation s results on a reported basis, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, because it believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Corporation and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Corporation with the performance of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
 
 78 

The SEC has adopted Regulation G, which applies to all public disclosures, including earnings releases, made by registered companies that contain non-GAAP financial measures. Under Regulation G, companies making public disclosures containing non-GAAP financial measures must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure, certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure and a statement of the Corporation s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure as part of its financial disclosures. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. When these exempted measures are included in public disclosures, supplemental information is not required. The following measures used in this Report, which are commonly utilized by financial institutions, have not been specifically exempted by the SEC and may constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of the SEC's rules, although we are unable to state with certainty that the SEC would so regard them. 

Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 
 
 Net interest income is commonly presented on a tax-equivalent basis. That is, to the extent that some component of the institution's net interest income, which is presented on a before-tax basis, is exempt from taxation (e.g., is received by the institution as a result of its holdings of state or municipal obligations), an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from that component is added to the actual before-tax net interest income total. This adjustment is considered helpful in comparing one financial institution's net interest income to that of other institutions or in analyzing any institution s net interest income trend line over time, to correct any analytical distortion that might otherwise arise from the fact that financial institutions vary widely in the proportions of their portfolios that are invested in tax-exempt securities, and that even a single institution may significantly alter over time the proportion of its own portfolio that is invested in tax-exempt obligations. Moreover, net interest income is itself a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. For purposes of this measure as well, fully taxable equivalent net interest income is generally used by financial institutions, as opposed to actual net interest income, again to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution and to better demonstrate a single institution s performance over time. The Corporation follows these practices.

 Efficiency Ratio 
 
 The unadjusted efficiency ratio is calculated as non-interest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and non-interest income). The adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents the Corporation s ability to turn resources into revenue and is calculated as non-interest expense divided by total revenue (fully taxable equivalent net interest income and non-interest income), adjusted for one-time occurrences and amortization of intangible assets. This measure is meaningful to the Corporation, as well as to investors and analysts, in assessing the Corporation s productivity measured by the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.

 Tangible Equity and Tangible Assets (Period-End) 
 
 Tangible equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per share are each non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible equity represents the Corporation s stockholders equity, less goodwill and intangible assets. Tangible assets represents the Corporation s total assets, less goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible book value per share represents the Corporation s tangible equity divided by common shares at period-end. These measures are meaningful to the Corporation, as well as to investors and analysts, in assessing the Corporation s use of equity.

Tangible Equity (Average) 
 
 Average tangible equity and return on average tangible equity are each non-GAAP financial measures. Average tangible equity represents the Corporation s average stockholders equity, less average goodwill and intangible assets for the period. Return on average tangible equity measures the Corporation s earnings as a percentage of average tangible equity. These measures are meaningful to the Corporation, as well as to investors and analysts, in assessing the Corporation s use of equity.

 Adjustments for Certain Items of Income or Expense 
 
 In addition to disclosures of certain GAAP financial measures, including net income, EPS, ROA, and ROE, we may also provide comparative disclosures that adjust these GAAP financial measures for a particular period by removing from the calculation thereof the impact of certain transactions or other material items of income or expense occurring during the period, including certain nonrecurring items. The Corporation believes that the resulting non-GAAP financial measures may improve an understanding of its results of operations by separating out any such transactions or items that may have had a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Corporation s financial results during the particular period in question. In the Corporation s presentation of any such non-GAAP (adjusted) financial measures not specifically discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the Corporation supplies the supplemental financial information and explanations required under Regulation G.

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Management considers interest rate risk to be the most significant market risk for the Corporation. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net income of the Corporation as a result of changes in interest rates. 
 
 The Corporation s primary earnings source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, the relationship between rates, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, the level and composition of deposits and liabilities, and credit quality of earning assets. 
 
 The Corporation s objectives in its asset and liability management are to maintain a strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks, to maintain adequate liquidity, and to reduce vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates. The Corporation's ALCO has the strategic responsibility for setting the policy guidelines on acceptable exposure to interest rate risk. These guidelines contain specific measures and limits regarding the risks, which are monitored on a regular basis. The ALCO is made up of the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, the Asset Liability Management Officer, and other officers representing key functions. 
 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that net interest income will fluctuate as a result of a change in interest rates. It is the assumption of interest rate risk, along with credit risk, that drives the net interest margin of a financial institution. For that reason, the ALCO has established tolerance limits based upon various basis point changes in interest rates, with appropriate floors set for interest-bearing liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, it is estimated that immediate decreases in interest rates of 100 basis points and 200 basis points would positively impact the next 12 months net interest income by 2.75 and 4.55 , respectively. Immediate increases in interest rates of 100 basis points and 200 basis points would positively impact the next 12 months net interest income by 2.16 and 4.22 , respectively. All scenarios are within the Corporation's policy guidelines. 
 Change in interest rates Percentage Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income over 12 Months 200 basis points decrease 4.55 100 basis points decrease 2.75 100 basis points increase 2.16 200 basis points increase 4.22 
 
 A related component of interest rate risk is the expectation that the market value of the Corporation s equity account will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. This component is a direct corollary to the earnings-impact component: an institution exposed to earnings erosion is also exposed to a decline in market value. As of September 30, 2024, it is estimated that immediate decreases in interest rates of 100 basis points and 200 basis points would positively impact the market value of the Corporation s capital account by 3.10 and 4.31 respectively. Immediate increases in interest rates of 100 basis points and 200 basis points would positively impact the market value by 0.92 and 1.37 respectively. All scenarios are within the Corporation's policy guidelines. 
 Change in interest rates Percentage Increase (Decrease) in Present Value of Corporation's Equity 200 basis points decrease 4.31 100 basis points decrease 3.10 100 basis points increase 0.92 200 basis points increase 1.37 
 
 Management does recognize the need for certain hedging strategies during periods of anticipated higher fluctuations in interest rates and the Funds Management Policy provides for limited use of certain derivatives in asset liability management. 

82 

Credit Risk 
 
 The Corporation manages credit risk consistent with state and federal laws governing the making of loans through written policies and procedures; loan review to identify loan problems at the earliest possible time; collection procedures (continued even after a loan is charged off); an adequate allowance for credit losses; and continuing education and training to ensure lending expertise. Diversification by loan product is maintained through offering commercial loans, 1-4 family mortgages, and a full range of consumer loans. 
 
 The Corporation monitors its loan portfolio carefully. The Loan Committee of the Corporation's Board of Directors is designated to receive required loan reports, oversee loan policy, and approve loans above authorized individual and Senior Loan Committee lending limits. The Senior Loan Committee, consisting of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (non-voting), Chief Credit and Risk Officer, Business Client Division Manager, Retail Client Division Manager, Retail Loan Manager, Senior Commercial Real Estate Lender, and Commercial Loan Managers, implements the Board-approved loan policy.

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Corporation's management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer, who is the Corporation's principal executive officer, and its Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, who is the Corporation's principal financial and accounting officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. In addition, there have been no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by the Corporation under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 On February 4, 2020, the Corporation filed a lawsuit against Pioneer Bank, Albany, New York, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of Albany. As disclosed in the Corporation s September 12, 2019 Current Report on Form 8-K, the Bank owns a participating interest totaling 4.2 million in an approximately 36.0 million commercial credit facility on which the borrower defaulted due to fraudulent activity. The Bank s complaint alleges that Pioneer Bank, as lead bank, breached the participation agreement and engaged in fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The Corporation received a recovery of 0.5 million in April, 2020, and continues to pursue recovery of the remaining 3.7 million and accumulated expenses as a result of purchasing the participation interest. 
 
 Other than as noted above, the Corporation believes that it is not a party to any pending legal, arbitration, or regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial results or liquidity as of September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors set forth in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2024. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Purchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in private negotiated transactions and will be at the discretion of management. As of September 30, 2024 the Corporation has repurchased a total of 49,184 shares at the weighted average cost of 40.42 per share.
